8/3/18, 11:36 PM - Parker: there’s still the one from the world cup which isn’t a big deal but technically i’ve paid you $6 hahah
8/4/18, 12:10 AM - Vaughn: Oh lol forgot about that one
8/4/18, 12:11 AM - Collin Hurst: ALLLLLEEEEZZZZ
8/4/18, 12:13 AM - Collin Hurst: How are we doing gas I thought I was going to pay half of Matt's to cover Darren and Alex and other car splits
8/4/18, 12:14 AM - Vaughn: Idk i used payed 90 in gas so just gunna request 10 from everyone
8/4/18, 12:14 AM - Matt Casali: I didnt drive in your car though
8/4/18, 12:15 AM - Vaughn: Oh yeah, still 10 for everyone else
8/4/18, 12:16 AM - Collin Hurst: Ok so then matt sllit between everyone too? And then I owe Alex and Darren
8/4/18, 12:20 AM - Matt Casali: What is top, mid and low tier for smash for our group with three people in each group
8/4/18, 12:21 AM - Matt Casali: I say:
Alex, Vaughn, Darren
Collin, Ricky, Matt
Jason, Tim, Parker 
And the list is in order from best to worst
8/4/18, 12:22 AM - Collin Hurst: Yeah I mean based on earlier tournaments I beat Darren but he's been fucking me up lately
8/4/18, 12:22 AM - Matt Casali: We need a tournament
8/4/18, 12:23 AM - Matt Casali: Maybe with a balanced bracket?
8/4/18, 12:23 AM - Collin Hurst: Yeah I want to change your mind
8/4/18, 12:23 AM - Collin Hurst: And put you in the lowest bracket
8/4/18, 12:26 AM - Matt Casali: I beat you and Vaughn tonight
8/4/18, 12:26 AM - Vaughn: Group play means nothing
8/4/18, 12:26 AM - Matt Casali: Sit down boi
8/4/18, 12:26 AM - Collin Hurst: ^
8/4/18, 12:26 AM - Matt Casali: But
8/4/18, 12:26 AM - Collin Hurst: I would never play ganon in a tourney
8/4/18, 12:26 AM - Vaughn: Alex and I are pretty equal until we do more 1v1s
8/4/18, 12:27 AM - Collin Hurst: I heard that you have this one character tho...
8/4/18, 12:27 AM - Vaughn: Rumor has it...
8/4/18, 12:29 AM - Matt Casali: We should determine tournament seeding like this:  2 8 player matches, last person in first one switches out, take average of placement. If there's a tie then we tie break based off of kills so on. 1st gets a by, second plays last, third plays 8th and so on
8/4/18, 12:29 AM - Matt Casali: We might have to ban villager 1v1...
8/4/18, 12:29 AM - Collin Hurst: Ew ^^
8/4/18, 12:30 AM - Collin Hurst: Gross
8/4/18, 12:33 AM - Matt Casali: What why?
8/4/18, 12:34 AM - Matt Casali: It gives an element of randomness with skill and usual rankings involve
8/4/18, 12:34 AM - Collin Hurst: Why not seed like a regular tourney and do round robin
8/4/18, 12:34 AM - Collin Hurst: Element of campiness
8/4/18, 12:35 AM - Matt Casali: Oh there's a solution for that
8/4/18, 12:35 AM - Matt Casali: Its called: dont be a bitch
8/4/18, 12:35 AM - Matt Casali: How do you seed it?
8/4/18, 12:42 AM - Tim Ko: My performance exponential increases when more ppl play and we on a smallish stage
8/4/18, 12:43 AM - Collin Hurst: Wins, with kills as to breakers
8/4/18, 4:01 AM - Jason Greenberg: Bitch I'm mid tier
8/4/18, 7:27 AM - Parker: no shit
8/4/18, 7:27 AM - Parker: i don’t disagree but fuck you

8/4/18, 7:39 AM - Matt Casali: Possibly

8/4/18, 10:56 AM - Alex Starr: I think he can go to work earlier haha
8/4/18, 10:56 AM - Collin Hurst: I can try but I can't guarantee ill be there on time
8/4/18, 10:57 AM - Matt Casali: Can you guarantee you'll be there on time if we do 8?
8/4/18, 10:57 AM - Matt Casali: As in: if you're not on time, you're standing gets affected

8/4/18, 10:59 AM - Matt Casali: Then their standing will be affected
8/4/18, 10:59 AM - Alex Starr: Could just preseed and do Collins match last
8/4/18, 10:59 AM - Matt Casali: Booo preseeding
8/4/18, 11:00 AM - Matt Casali: I have an idea
8/4/18, 11:01 AM - Alex Starr: Uh oh
8/4/18, 11:01 AM - Matt Casali: Two games with 4 people in it with 3 stocks, 9th person gets a by. The groups are decided randomly. 1st place in a group plays last place in another and it goes on like that
8/4/18, 11:01 AM - Matt Casali: That sounds good
8/4/18, 11:02 AM - Vaughn: Stop talking to yourself
8/4/18, 11:02 AM - Collin Hurst: I can def get there by 8, can't guarantee 7
8/4/18, 11:02 AM - Vaughn: I get off work at 8 so earliest I can get to your place is 8:15 and I'll still be wet
8/4/18, 11:03 AM - Collin Hurst: wetstar
8/4/18, 11:03 AM - Collin Hurst: lol
8/4/18, 11:03 AM - Alex Starr: Wetfisher*
8/4/18, 11:03 AM - Collin Hurst: two words, round robin
8/4/18, 11:04 AM - Alex Starr: Or double elimination groups
8/4/18, 11:04 AM - Alex Starr: Really depends on how long we want this to go on
8/4/18, 11:04 AM - Matt Casali: Groups would be:
Jason, Alex, Parker, Matt
Vaughn, Collin, Ricky, Tim
Darren has a by
8/4/18, 11:05 AM - Alex Starr: Vaughn should be 1 seed
8/4/18, 11:05 AM - Alex Starr: And have a bye
8/4/18, 11:05 AM - Alex Starr: Cuz he’ll be late cuz he has work
8/4/18, 11:05 AM - Matt Casali: K switch out Darren for Vaughn
8/4/18, 11:05 AM - Vaughn: https://goo.gl/images/cMJ1hT

8/4/18, 11:06 AM - Alex Starr: And then how would the groups work?
8/4/18, 11:06 AM - Alex Starr: I feel like we should try to make it 2.5 hours tops
8/4/18, 11:08 AM - Tim Ko: Lol they came so early wtf
8/4/18, 11:09 AM - Alex Starr: I’d say top 2 advance double elimination groups
8/4/18, 11:09 AM - Alex Starr: And since no way in hell we have all 9, no need to worry about odd numbers
8/4/18, 11:10 AM - Collin Hurst: Not an ice cubes chance as you would say
8/4/18, 11:10 AM - Alex Starr: Exactly
8/4/18, 11:11 AM - Collin Hurst: And we're not talking about those sturdy ones you have at home I'm talking about those weak slushy pellet ones
8/4/18, 11:16 AM - Jason Greenberg: Essay I beat you 2/3 no problem
8/4/18, 11:18 AM - Collin Hurst: oooo
8/4/18, 11:22 AM - Tim Ko: Idk if Jason could beat me
8/4/18, 11:23 AM - Alex Starr: I’m betting on tim
8/4/18, 11:23 AM - Tim Ko: I got my new character
8/4/18, 11:23 AM - Alex Starr: Even with old ones I remember you winning
8/4/18, 11:24 AM - Tim Ko: Maybe, if it was little Mac on a non falling stage
8/4/18, 11:24 AM - Alex Starr: It was Marth
8/4/18, 11:29 AM - Tim Ko: Oh I don’t even remember
8/4/18, 11:29 AM - Tim Ko: We should have a scrub tournament
8/4/18, 11:29 AM - Tim Ko: Me Jason parker and matt
8/4/18, 11:30 AM - Jason Greenberg: Agreed
8/4/18, 11:36 AM - Matt Casali: I'm so sad
8/4/18, 11:36 AM - Matt Casali: Because I've spent so much time on the game
8/4/18, 11:36 AM - Matt Casali: And I'd be included in the scrub tournament
8/4/18, 11:36 AM - Collin Hurst: Rip
8/4/18, 11:37 AM - Matt Casali: Not sure I follow.
8/4/18, 11:37 AM - Matt Casali: Idk about that
8/4/18, 11:37 AM - Matt Casali: Also aren't you in spain? You should know how to spell that haha
8/4/18, 11:38 AM - Jason Greenberg: We have a rumble and we will see ok big stuff?
8/4/18, 11:41 AM - Alex Starr: 5 best of three matches 1 vs 4 2 vs 3
8/4/18, 11:41 AM - Alex Starr: Winner match loser match decider match
8/4/18, 11:41 AM - Alex Starr: Need to practice better
8/4/18, 11:41 AM - Matt Casali: Not sure what to do haha
8/4/18, 11:41 AM - Matt Casali: At school I could only play darren
8/4/18, 11:41 AM - Matt Casali: Or comp
8/4/18, 11:41 AM - Alex Starr: Pick a character, watch a video, and practice alone
8/4/18, 11:42 AM - Matt Casali: I do that
8/4/18, 11:42 AM - Alex Starr: Ur in the phase where u should be mostly doing things solo
8/4/18, 11:42 AM - Matt Casali: Maybe just practice more
8/4/18, 11:42 AM - Alex Starr: Make it so that you can move your character however you want to
8/4/18, 11:42 AM - Matt Casali: Who do you watch?
8/4/18, 11:42 AM - Alex Starr: I don’t really
8/4/18, 11:42 AM - Matt Casali: Meaning what
8/4/18, 11:43 AM - Alex Starr: I used to watch tournaments and that helped
8/4/18, 11:43 AM - Alex Starr: There are techniques that allow you to move your character better
8/4/18, 11:43 AM - Tim Ko: What’s ur best character matt
8/4/18, 11:43 AM - Alex Starr: Look up RAR, perfect pivot, extended dash dancing
8/4/18, 11:43 AM - Alex Starr: And pick a good character that’s fairly easy
8/4/18, 11:44 AM - Alex Starr: Dedede sucks d
8/4/18, 11:44 AM - Alex Starr: And on the other side fox is amazing but very hard to use
8/4/18, 11:44 AM - Matt Casali: Haha the group's passed the time where Dedede works
8/4/18, 11:45 AM - Tim Ko: Matt I think we would be even if I played u with pac man
8/4/18, 11:45 AM - Matt Casali: Diddy Kong, Villager or Ganondorf
8/4/18, 11:45 AM - Alex Starr: Diddy is strongest villager might be easier to use
8/4/18, 11:45 AM - Alex Starr: But also pick a character you enjoy playing
8/4/18, 11:46 AM - Matt Casali: Ganon is def most fun
8/4/18, 11:46 AM - Alex Starr: He is trash
8/4/18, 11:46 AM - Matt Casali: Vaughn's beaten you a couple times
8/4/18, 11:46 AM - Alex Starr: Not when I play my better characters
8/4/18, 11:46 AM - Alex Starr: And yeah we’ve played a bunch haha
8/4/18, 11:47 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah true
8/4/18, 11:47 AM - Matt Casali: Also ganondorf may be my strongest cause its easiest/most fun to play him so I've done it a lot
8/4/18, 11:47 AM - Alex Starr: It’s about what will be strong later tho
8/4/18, 11:48 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah makes sense
8/4/18, 11:48 AM - Alex Starr: Maybe watch evo

8/4/18, 12:15 PM - Collin Hurst: Ok play Ganon see what happens
8/4/18, 1:32 PM - Ricky: graces parents aren’t home tonight so she invited us and her friends to come over and causally drink / play games and just hang out if you guys wanna go after my dinner!?
8/4/18, 1:32 PM - Ricky: I hear from a very reliable source Ryan will be there
8/4/18, 1:50 PM - Matt Casali: Smash

Matt, Jason, Parker, Tim
8/4/18, 2:12 PM - Matt Casali: ^
8/4/18, 2:16 PM - Collin Hurst: Roundrobinroundrobinroundrobin
8/4/18, 2:18 PM - Parker: ^
8/4/18, 2:18 PM - Parker: even though i likely can’t be there
8/4/18, 2:34 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah let’s do round robin to do the seeding
8/4/18, 2:39 PM - Alex Starr: A round robin would take soooooo long
8/4/18, 2:40 PM - Alex Starr: And not prove much
8/4/18, 2:41 PM - Parker: Let’s get the fifa president to do a random ball drawing for grouping
8/4/18, 2:45 PM - Darren: If you're doing a round robin, you may as well just use the results of that as the tournament
8/4/18, 2:45 PM - Collin Hurst: It could be fair to split it into the top four and bottom four so seeding takes less time
8/4/18, 2:53 PM - Ricky: graces parents aren’t home tonight so she invited us and her friends to come over and causally drink / play games and just hang out if you guys wanna go after my dinner!?
8/4/18, 2:53 PM - Ricky: I like any kind of cake
8/4/18, 2:53 PM - Ricky: Do a poll

8/4/18, 3:05 PM - Parker: lol what
8/4/18, 3:06 PM - Darren: An extreme escape room
8/4/18, 3:06 PM - Alex Starr: Ur gonna need 50 feet of rope and 2 weeks of food/water
8/4/18, 3:07 PM - Alex Starr: U could bring more, but if you aren’t out after two weeks you pretty much can expect to have been eaten
8/4/18, 3:32 PM - Ricky: Everyone should come around 4
8/4/18, 3:32 PM - Ricky: 7mins late is still acceptable but 15 mins will be a direct attack at your care about me

8/4/18, 3:41 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah idk why but ur bday gathering is one of the memories I have when I think of high school
8/4/18, 4:11 PM - Matt Casali: What I did
8/4/18, 4:18 PM - Collin Hurst: But not as a group battle
8/4/18, 4:18 PM - Matt Casali: What is round robin

8/6/18, 4:36 PM - Tim Ko: The opposite of intimate
8/6/18, 4:36 PM - Collin Hurst: a date is definitely not the opposite of inimate wut
8/6/18, 4:38 PM - Tim Ko: I feel intimate is when u know someone for a long time and u have a special connection with them
8/6/18, 4:38 PM - Tim Ko: Or not long, but have many experiences together
8/6/18, 4:38 PM - Parker: Ok but he said not using that definition
8/6/18, 4:38 PM - Tim Ko: My dates have all been first or second timers
8/6/18, 4:38 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah it can def be that but not in this case
8/6/18, 4:38 PM - Collin Hurst: just like any sort of connection what so ever

8/7/18, 2:47 PM - Ricky: you are absolutely correct
8/7/18, 2:47 PM - Ricky: but that should keep you from commiting
8/7/18, 2:47 PM - Matt Casali: I agree
8/7/18, 2:47 PM - Ricky: even if you commit to something doesnt mean you HAVE to go
8/7/18, 2:47 PM - Alex Starr: I think that continuing to indulge matt in this conversation is unproductive and dull
8/7/18, 2:47 PM - Ricky: even if the night of you dont come you dont have to

8/7/18, 2:47 PM - Ricky: i dont find it dull

8/7/18, 3:51 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah, getting that done doesnt make sense to me

8/7/18, 3:59 PM - Matt Casali: Not really a joke
8/7/18, 4:00 PM - Matt Casali: More "oh why is there a maybe button, I'll just press it for no reason" then "Why is Matt a Maybe??" then "huh, maybe I should just say nonsensical stuff" then "matt you're a vegan cunt who has a sponsored birthmark"
8/7/18, 4:00 PM - Collin Hurst: such a weird dynamic now thanks matt
8/7/18, 4:00 PM - Matt Casali: I bring out the best in my friends
8/7/18, 4:01 PM - Ricky: ok well from my perspective I was concerned about your well being/if you would come to the party and instead just toyed with taht
8/7/18, 4:01 PM - Collin Hurst: you have to think about the consequences of your actions matt
8/7/18, 4:01 PM - Collin Hurst: you just go around clicking buttons

8/7/18, 4:03 PM - Ricky: and i wanted to make sure it wasnt getting too far

8/12/18, 9:14 AM - Alex Starr: The guy/girl peak was pretty surprising but I suppose it isn’t shocking that so much time is spent  going for people outside your league
8/12/18, 9:16 AM - Alex Starr: Tho I think part of that is if you see someone who is really attractive, messaging has no downsides
8/12/18, 9:25 AM - Jason Greenberg: Thats true. I would have liked to see some numbers how like how many messages equates to a successful date
8/12/18, 9:39 AM - Parker: that’s impressive

8/13/18, 10:44 AM - Alex Starr: It’ll be a breeze compared to college workload lol
8/13/18, 10:44 AM - Collin Hurst: yeah school is harder on your brain imo
8/13/18, 10:45 AM - Collin Hurst: unless you work for a startup and work 80 hrs a week

8/13/18, 10:45 AM - Collin Hurst: Like any regular 9-5 job is less stressful and easier
8/13/18, 10:46 AM - Parker: that’s like the minimum
8/13/18, 10:46 AM - Alex Starr: High level consulting too
8/13/18, 10:46 AM - Parker: yeah

8/13/18, 10:47 AM - Tim Ko: U gotta produce at work which is about as stressful as exams
8/13/18, 10:48 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah but you have all this time and resources at hand
8/13/18, 10:48 AM - Darren: Except when you don't
8/13/18, 10:48 AM - Jason Greenberg: How bout a rocket launch

8/13/18, 10:51 AM - Alex Starr: That’s not how research works lol
8/13/18, 10:51 AM - Jason Greenberg: Particle accelerator
8/13/18, 10:51 AM - Alex Starr: Failure is often an acceptable or even expected outcome
8/13/18, 10:51 AM - Jason Greenberg: Gotcha bitch
8/13/18, 10:51 AM - Darren: How bout when you're taking 2 weeks PTO and are on vacation and you're pm sends you an email saying your company has been hacked and infrastructure compromised and you have to diagnose the situation and freeze operations with your team in 24 hours so now you're working again
8/13/18, 10:51 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah but eventually U gotta produce results
8/13/18, 10:51 AM - Alex Starr: Plus u can do it 100 times
8/13/18, 10:51 AM - Darren: Not to be too specific
8/13/18, 10:51 AM - Alex Starr: Not really it might simply not work
8/13/18, 10:52 AM - Tim Ko: Otherwise u get no funding
8/13/18, 10:52 AM - Alex Starr: At least you didn’t add names
8/13/18, 10:52 AM - Alex Starr: It’s not dependent on one project
8/13/18, 10:52 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah true, but u gotta come up with something that works
8/13/18, 10:53 AM - Alex Starr: And as someone who has worked on a 100,000 dollar failure, no funding doesn’t mean you can’t get some lol
8/13/18, 10:53 AM - Matt Casali: Computer guys have a different situation
8/13/18, 10:53 AM - Alex Starr: In that it’s more similar to school
8/13/18, 10:54 AM - Matt Casali: A lot of the work they do can be done remotely, so they're expected to work more
8/13/18, 10:54 AM - Alex Starr: I don’t think that’s causal but I don’t disagree with either point on it’s own
8/13/18, 10:56 AM - Darren: How about if you are put in charge of optimizing and rewriting a codebase used for the most important data ingestion engine your company has, but the previous codebase is shit and if you break the pipeline the entire data science team comes down on you
8/13/18, 10:56 AM - Tim Ko: Ehh a lot of postdocs I see are literally at work for 12 HRs a day
8/13/18, 10:56 AM - Matt Casali: What I said earlier haha
8/13/18, 10:56 AM - Darren: That's not a work amount issue
8/13/18, 10:56 AM - Darren: That's a work is hard issue
8/13/18, 10:56 AM - Parker: 16>12
8/13/18, 10:56 AM - Alex Starr: Seems roughly the same as taking 3 exams in one day
8/13/18, 10:57 AM - Matt Casali: I'm not talking about work amount, just different requirements for different fields
8/13/18, 10:57 AM - Collin Hurst: what if you are teaching a class of kids in 12 hours and you dont know anything about the subject you are about to teach so you have to study it
8/13/18, 10:57 AM - Alex Starr: I don’t think a series of highly specific examples really answer the question haha
8/13/18, 10:58 AM - Alex Starr: Tho I seem to be in the minority on the school is harder than work front
8/13/18, 10:58 AM - Darren: You go to Berkeley
8/13/18, 10:59 AM - Darren: Santa Cruz is easy
8/13/18, 10:59 AM - Matt Casali: All I know is that studying quantum physics was harder than serving cakes
8/13/18, 10:59 AM - Parker: !
8/13/18, 10:59 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah but I’m also implying that on some fundamental level
8/13/18, 10:59 AM - Collin Hurst: idk ive heard a lot of things about those old ladies
8/13/18, 11:00 AM - Alex Starr: Baking tho
8/13/18, 11:00 AM - Alex Starr: Is hard
8/13/18, 11:00 AM - Parker: I think you’re underestimating these cakes
8/13/18, 11:00 AM - Matt Casali: *overestimating
8/13/18, 11:01 AM - Tim Ko: Damn parker, that’s some confidence
8/13/18, 11:01 AM - Darren: I have been stressed about school on the scale of 1 week. Work has longer and, imo, more important life cycles for projects
8/13/18, 11:01 AM - Parker: alex i appreciate the replies to your own messages lol
8/13/18, 11:01 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah tho u obviously have a pretty unique work situation
8/13/18, 11:01 AM - Parker: ;)
8/13/18, 11:03 AM - Alex Starr: I think that also as an employee it’s a lot of how to do questions rather than what to do questions which makes it way easier at least for me
8/13/18, 11:03 AM - Alex Starr: Also Darren I think given it work situation, it is so similar to school that it almost supports my argument
8/13/18, 11:04 AM - Alex Starr: Your not it
8/13/18, 11:05 AM - Darren: What
8/13/18, 11:06 AM - Alex Starr: Steep learning curve with writing the code to learn as homework and actual work on the project as an exam
8/13/18, 11:06 AM - Alex Starr: Parallels pretty nicely
8/13/18, 11:07 AM - Darren: But that's what work is like too
8/13/18, 11:07 AM - Matt Casali: Skool sux munny rulz
8/13/18, 11:09 AM - Alex Starr: Minus the learning curve in a lot of cases
8/13/18, 11:10 AM - Alex Starr: Just thinking about what my parents do at least
8/13/18, 11:11 AM - Alex Starr: This is where frank underwood would remind you not to confuse money with power
8/13/18, 11:11 AM - Darren: Which one gets you close to more kids? I believe it's skool
8/13/18, 11:12 AM - Alex Starr: Also family guy made a joke about Kevin spacey harassing male children 10 years before the rest of the world caught on
8/13/18, 11:12 AM - Darren: I think if I were in eecs at Cal, I would be on your side. But if you went to ucsc, youd be on mine
8/13/18, 11:13 AM - Darren: Also he won his first Oscar for playing a guy harassing young boys in american beauty
8/13/18, 11:13 AM - Matt Casali: I thought it was young girls
8/13/18, 11:13 AM - Alex Starr: How couldn’t we have known?
8/13/18, 11:14 AM - Darren: Yesh
8/13/18, 11:15 AM - Alex Starr: In American beauty or irl?
8/13/18, 11:15 AM - Matt Casali: American beauty
8/13/18, 5:44 PM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
8/13/18, 5:44 PM - Collin Hurst: I love reading our support intercom chats haha
8/13/18, 10:40 PM - Matt Casali: Larry Lurr is fun to watch
8/13/18, 10:43 PM - Alex Starr: Ur not wrong
8/13/18, 10:44 PM - Darren: Light >
8/13/18, 10:44 PM - Matt Casali: And I really dont like salem
8/13/18, 10:44 PM - Alex Starr: Also not wrong
8/13/18, 10:44 PM - Matt Casali: Just cause I've been taught to dislike bayonetta
8/13/18, 10:55 PM - Darren: You don't get taught to dislike bayo
8/13/18, 10:55 PM - Darren: Bayo is just bull
8/13/18, 10:56 PM - Matt Casali: Is evo one of the only major tournaments that allows her?
8/13/18, 10:57 PM - Darren: No major tournament bans her and not many minors
8/13/18, 10:58 PM - Matt Casali: Oh really?
8/13/18, 10:58 PM - Darren: It's not pgr qualified if bayo is banned
8/13/18, 10:59 PM - Matt Casali: Well at least there was only 1 in the top 8
8/13/18, 11:00 PM - Darren: In what tournament
8/13/18, 11:02 PM - Matt Casali: Evo
8/13/18, 11:02 PM - Darren: Recent Evo had grand finals Zach v lima
8/13/18, 11:03 PM - Alex Starr: Both bayo
8/13/18, 11:03 PM - Alex Starr: Tho matt is definitely watching 2017
8/13/18, 11:04 PM - Darren: Ah
8/13/18, 11:05 PM - Darren: For reference, this happened in Grand finals of evos this year: https://clips.twitch.tv/BlueDeliciousPuffinDogFace
8/13/18, 11:05 PM - Matt Casali: Oh fuck haha
8/13/18, 11:05 PM - Matt Casali: This whole time I thought I was watching 2018
8/14/18, 12:47 PM - Ricky: anyone wanna go to a giants game next friday?!

8/14/18, 5:46 PM - Ricky: Does anybody want to?
8/14/18, 5:46 PM - Parker: i want to but don’t know if i can

8/14/18, 5:51 PM - Darren: Maybe that's why👃🏼
8/14/18, 5:51 PM - Collin Hurst: I just don't really like spending my time/money on bball games
8/14/18, 5:51 PM - Parker: hahaha
8/14/18, 5:52 PM - Ricky: Ok, kinda lackluster excuse considering you went to one earlier this summer but still valid
8/14/18, 5:52 PM - Ricky: No prob ❤
8/14/18, 5:53 PM - Collin Hurst: I didn't!
8/14/18, 5:53 PM - Ricky: Oh you didn’t go to that one?
8/14/18, 5:53 PM - Darren: That was me
8/14/18, 5:53 PM - Ricky: Gotcha
8/14/18, 5:53 PM - Ricky: Aha I know u did
8/14/18, 5:53 PM - Darren: But I echo his belief
8/14/18, 5:53 PM - Collin Hurst: nope for same reason pretty much haha
8/14/18, 5:53 PM - Ricky: I just wasn’t there but thought everyone else did
8/14/18, 5:53 PM - Darren: And that was a lackluster accusation
8/14/18, 5:53 PM - Ricky: Even playing field
8/14/18, 5:57 PM - Alex Starr: It’s day 3 of school for me
8/14/18, 5:57 PM - Alex Starr: And it’s baseball
8/14/18, 5:58 PM - Alex Starr: Which is the real kicker
8/14/18, 5:58 PM - Ricky: nooooo problem
8/14/18, 5:58 PM - Ricky: juust want to know to let graces friends know whether to come or not and such
8/14/18, 5:59 PM - Alex Starr: If it were a non-baseball event I would be more down (for future reference)
8/14/18, 5:59 PM - Collin Hurst: but  we should get cheap tix for a barracudas game and go down to the galass
8/14/18, 5:59 PM - Darren: No
8/14/18, 6:00 PM - Collin Hurst: 🙋‍♂yes
8/14/18, 6:00 PM - Alex Starr: Or we could not do that
8/14/18, 6:02 PM - Ricky: I would be down
8/14/18, 6:17 PM - Matt Casali: Same here
8/14/18, 6:17 PM - Matt Casali: Suggest that instead
8/14/18, 6:17 PM - Ricky: You would not have work for a barracudas game?
8/14/18, 6:17 PM - Matt Casali: I might
8/14/18, 6:18 PM - Matt Casali: Like I said, I wont know until a week before

8/15/18, 8:38 PM - Ricky: Sry boss
8/15/18, 8:38 PM - Ricky: She prob just didn’t know what to do
8/15/18, 8:42 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah prob haha just an awkward situation all the way around

8/15/18, 8:44 PM - Ricky: Well we all wish we could be collin
8/15/18, 8:45 PM - Ricky: It you do You tim
8/15/18, 8:45 PM - Ricky: If she don’t want you for you, you didn’t want her anyway
8/15/18, 8:45 PM - Collin Hurst: Vaughn where are you
8/15/18, 8:45 PM - Collin Hurst: Did you guys make a quick stop in the Philippines or something
8/15/18, 8:55 PM - Tim Ko: Aww thx bud!!
8/15/18, 8:56 PM - Alex Starr: And don’t worry no matter who you’re with, we all die alone
8/15/18, 9:06 PM - Parker: Not if you’re sitting next to your SO in a plane crash and then get buried together
8/15/18, 9:06 PM - Ricky: ^ gang
8/15/18, 9:06 PM - Ricky: Living the dream
8/15/18, 9:09 PM - Alex Starr: Even then
8/15/18, 9:09 PM - Alex Starr: Life is the dream
8/15/18, 9:10 PM - Alex Starr: So I guess ur living it?
8/15/18, 9:11 PM - Ricky: if your living and conscious you aren’t living a dream but if your dreaming your barely even living
8/15/18, 9:13 PM - Alex Starr: Nah life is the dream and death is waking up
8/15/18, 9:13 PM - Alex Starr: It’s nice, but everyone must wake eventually
8/15/18, 9:13 PM - Tim Ko: I feel like since I’ve always been single, its not bad cuz it’s not like anything was taken away from me. Unlike break ups where u had an SO but now u don’t anymore. That’s why i don’t think I could ever fully empathize with ppl who are going through break ups no matter how hard I try
8/15/18, 9:14 PM - Alex Starr: You’re probably right tho I think I could empathize
8/15/18, 9:16 PM - Alex Starr: Always being single is much much worse
8/15/18, 9:17 PM - Alex Starr: Better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all
8/15/18, 9:17 PM - Ricky: True
8/15/18, 9:17 PM - Alex Starr: That’s like the oldest quote in the book
8/15/18, 9:18 PM - Ricky: You do you
8/15/18, 9:18 PM - Ricky: And yolo
8/15/18, 9:18 PM - Ricky: Those the real quotes to live by
8/15/18, 9:18 PM - Alex Starr: Fuck that shit
8/15/18, 9:18 PM - Ricky: Why? Haha
8/15/18, 9:18 PM - Alex Starr: It’s meaningless
8/15/18, 9:18 PM - Ricky: They are both so loose they can apply to anything
8/15/18, 9:18 PM - Alex Starr: It offers no real aid
8/15/18, 9:18 PM - Ricky: Or do they mean everything?
8/15/18, 9:19 PM - Alex Starr: It’s like good luck
8/15/18, 9:19 PM - Alex Starr: Everything and nothing are equivalent
8/15/18, 9:19 PM - Ricky: Naw good luck is just wishing someone luck
8/15/18, 9:19 PM - Ricky: Yolo is at least some advise
8/15/18, 9:19 PM - Alex Starr: Nah
8/15/18, 9:19 PM - Alex Starr: It’s applicable to everything and completely unhelpful
8/15/18, 9:19 PM - Ricky: You have your thoughts
8/15/18, 9:19 PM - Ricky: I have used it many times
8/15/18, 9:19 PM - Ricky: And it has helped
8/15/18, 9:20 PM - Ricky: Even if it means nothing
8/15/18, 9:20 PM - Alex Starr: If only we could all muster such insight
8/15/18, 9:21 PM - Tim Ko: Ehh I’m enjoying life haha
8/15/18, 9:21 PM - Alex Starr: I can’t really argue against that
8/15/18, 9:21 PM - Ricky: I mean, I was just saying it to precise the differentiating thought I had
8/15/18, 9:22 PM - Ricky: Preface
8/15/18, 9:22 PM - Alex Starr: So do chickens, but if they felt as we do they’d never want to give it up
8/15/18, 9:22 PM - Alex Starr: Same thing with a relationship
8/15/18, 9:22 PM - Ricky: Good!
8/15/18, 9:23 PM - Ricky: Some people don’t want relationships ahah
8/15/18, 9:23 PM - Ricky: Or at least, committed ones
8/15/18, 9:23 PM - Alex Starr: They are extraordinarily rare
8/15/18, 9:23 PM - Alex Starr: I didn’t say committed
8/15/18, 9:23 PM - Ricky: A 1/9 chance?
8/15/18, 9:24 PM - Alex Starr: No relationships at all? I’d say way way lower
8/15/18, 9:25 PM - Alex Starr: The point I’m trying to make is sure ur happy now, but as you said there’s this whole other level of awareness
8/15/18, 9:25 PM - Alex Starr: That would make your current happiness seem a chicken in comparison
8/15/18, 9:25 PM - Ricky: It was a joke haha
8/15/18, 9:25 PM - Alex Starr: Apologies for the lack of clever analogy, all my clever ones are a tad cruel and unfortunate
8/15/18, 9:25 PM - Ricky: Haha
8/15/18, 9:26 PM - Ricky: It works
8/15/18, 9:26 PM - Alex Starr: Ya haha
8/15/18, 9:26 PM - Ricky: I’m just saying, dwelling on that won’t make you happier
8/15/18, 9:26 PM - Alex Starr: But it isn’t very pretty
8/15/18, 9:26 PM - Alex Starr: But if you never approach it you can’t reach that next level
8/15/18, 9:27 PM - Ricky: Idk, I’ve never really approached it actively haha and I’d say I’ve achieved a fairly successful relationship
8/15/18, 9:27 PM - Alex Starr: Then by definition u did haha
8/15/18, 9:27 PM - Ricky: I’m confused what our point of conflict is
8/15/18, 9:28 PM - Alex Starr: But where would we be without dwelling? Cold and rainy that’s where
8/15/18, 9:29 PM - Alex Starr: No conflict
8/15/18, 9:29 PM - Ricky: I don’t really get that statement but, it’s your life, you can do as you wish, I just would chose to push for success with positivity
8/15/18, 9:29 PM - Ricky: Wrong word but like
8/15/18, 9:29 PM - Alex Starr: Oh no that’s the conflict
8/15/18, 9:29 PM - Ricky: I was thinking of something diff than u were I’m pretty sure haha
8/15/18, 9:30 PM - Alex Starr: Dwelling is another word for house
8/15/18, 9:30 PM - Alex Starr: Don’t be so sure
8/15/18, 9:30 PM - Ricky: Ahhh, word play
8/15/18, 9:30 PM - Ricky: I’m saying I agreed with things that you were using as counter points to my unrelated thoughts haha
8/15/18, 9:31 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah can’t get anyone to play say they can’t find the point
8/15/18, 9:32 PM - Alex Starr: I dunno ur points didn’t really have a counter
8/15/18, 9:32 PM - Alex Starr: This message was deleted
8/15/18, 9:33 PM - Ricky: Haha
8/15/18, 9:33 PM - Alex Starr: They make a terrible bar for conversation in that way
8/15/18, 9:33 PM - Alex Starr: Things would just spill out and that’d make things tricky
8/15/18, 9:34 PM - Ricky: What things?
8/15/18, 9:34 PM - Alex Starr: Drinks
8/15/18, 9:34 PM - Ricky: Haha
8/15/18, 9:34 PM - Ricky: Alex
8/15/18, 9:34 PM - Ricky: I’m sorry
8/15/18, 9:34 PM - Alex Starr: No bar but you can’t hold it forever
8/15/18, 9:35 PM - Ricky: Reviewing this convo it looks like English isn’t my first language 😂
8/15/18, 9:35 PM - Alex Starr: There’s a dick joke in there but I certainly won’t be able to find it
8/15/18, 9:35 PM - Alex Starr: Tho I suppose if it’s a joke of a dick
8/15/18, 9:35 PM - Alex Starr: Or a dickish joke
8/15/18, 9:35 PM - Alex Starr: Rub that first one out I’m the man for the job
8/15/18, 9:36 PM - Ricky: Haha
8/15/18, 9:36 PM - Ricky: Alex, I’m gonna assume u are fairly bored
8/15/18, 9:36 PM - Ricky: I say that cuz I am haha
8/15/18, 9:36 PM - Alex Starr: Well I like to think of myself as a little more witty than a board
8/15/18, 9:37 PM - Ricky: Are you drunk?
8/15/18, 9:37 PM - Alex Starr: Tho I didn’t exactly nail that last comment really screwed it uo
8/15/18, 9:37 PM - Alex Starr: Up*
8/15/18, 9:37 PM - Ricky: If you are jason this is where you state you have had a lot to drink with your mom and are going to bed
8/15/18, 9:38 PM - Alex Starr: Hahaha I don’t have a response to that one you win
8/15/18, 9:38 PM - Alex Starr: Hate to meet the child from that would come out of that
8/15/18, 9:39 PM - Alex Starr: Okay so not a good response
8/15/18, 9:39 PM - Alex Starr: I’m not that bored tho am pretty bored
8/15/18, 9:40 PM - Alex Starr: I better be able to nail that look tho with all the practice I’ve had
8/15/18, 9:44 PM - Ricky: HahahahaH
8/15/18, 9:45 PM - Ricky: I’m glad your enjoying yourself a bit
8/15/18, 9:46 PM - Alex Starr: Oh if there’s one thing I’ve got down pat it’s enjoying myself
8/15/18, 9:46 PM - Alex Starr: I take you do you to heart
8/15/18, 9:46 PM - Alex Starr: I also appreciate the responses
8/15/18, 9:47 PM - Ricky: I wrote that and knew I set it up a bit but I did it anyway
8/15/18, 9:47 PM - Ricky: You’ve worked hard, you deserve it
8/15/18, 9:50 PM - Alex Starr: Thanks I always appreciate an assist on the finish but can’t usually get one
8/15/18, 9:55 PM - Ricky: It’s ok, usually don’t is better then pulling a matt
8/15/18, 9:55 PM - Ricky: That time you helped me finish!
8/15/18, 10:00 PM - Alex Starr: It is best to reciprocate in that regard
8/15/18, 10:00 PM - Alex Starr: Tho I avoided directly saying you helped me finish for a reason haha
8/15/18, 10:01 PM - Ricky: I did say it for a reason
8/15/18, 10:01 PM - Matt Casali: Dont drag me into this
8/15/18, 10:01 PM - Ricky: Cuz it’s true and if anyone happened to look at their phone it would make them confused
8/15/18, 10:01 PM - Ricky: I’m calling Alex on that one
8/15/18, 10:01 PM - Ricky: Although I did the finishing blow
8/15/18, 10:01 PM - Ricky: I blew alex to finish him*
8/15/18, 10:04 PM - Alex Starr: That one doesn’t work but I appreciate the attempt
8/15/18, 10:04 PM - Alex Starr: Maybe if it looked better it would have
8/15/18, 10:04 PM - Darren: <Media omitted>

8/16/18, 12:05 PM - Collin Hurst: looks good tho

8/18/18, 10:56 AM - Matt Casali: Not gonna lie, that was one of the worst experiences of my life last night
8/18/18, 10:56 AM - Collin Hurst: tf? how
8/18/18, 10:57 AM - Jason Greenberg: dayumm what happened
8/18/18, 10:57 AM - Jason Greenberg: that ferbie doll was getting in your head
8/18/18, 10:57 AM - Ricky: what happened?!?!?!
8/18/18, 10:57 AM - Ricky: was it like vaughn in tahoe:?
8/18/18, 11:00 AM - Jason Greenberg: if my memory is right at one point matt was worried about this furbie doll we had that did some freaky eye-lid moving, and when we put it in another room that was worse
8/18/18, 11:01 AM - Jason Greenberg: he was like way high
8/18/18, 11:05 AM - Ricky: hahaha
8/18/18, 11:05 AM - Ricky: oh no matty
8/18/18, 11:05 AM - Ricky: big boi
8/18/18, 11:14 AM - Matt Casali: The Furbie definitely started me off being super scared, like after Collin put it in my face. Like, it was a joke at first that it scared me but I couldn't get my mind off of it. Then after Vaughn and I made that video of it, I was pretty much over it. Then, I started feeling like I was on the verge of some like horrible trip for the rest of the night and that people were trying to get me to have a terrible trip by doing different things. I was honestly terrified of you guys for like a good hour. And it was all kinda dependent on the music, like there were some songs that made me feel alright and then there were just songs that sent me into like a terror fest.
8/18/18, 11:14 AM - Matt Casali: The music from Planet Earth brought me back though
8/18/18, 11:15 AM - Matt Casali: Also there was a song that Fredi and I listened to a lot that helped me some
8/18/18, 11:15 AM - Matt Casali: Also, Jason's cat slept in my arms last night which was nice
8/18/18, 11:16 AM - Collin Hurst: "I was honestly terrified of you guys for like a good hour'' I feel like you are always scared of us
8/18/18, 11:22 AM - Matt Casali: What?
8/18/18, 11:22 AM - Matt Casali: No?
8/18/18, 11:22 AM - Darren: No we just ruin his self esteem. That's different
8/18/18, 11:27 AM - Collin Hurst: I mean like when we make fun of you
8/18/18, 11:27 AM - Jason Greenberg: That be scary matt
8/18/18, 11:27 AM - Collin Hurst: I feel like thats how you describe us when we make jokes you don't like
8/18/18, 11:28 AM - Jason Greenberg: To me it seemed like you were like interacting with us for the first hour and then i think you just did you for a while before planet earth came on
8/18/18, 11:32 AM - Matt Casali: See Darren's message
8/18/18, 11:37 AM - Collin Hurst: Well you said that you didn't see us as human beings
8/18/18, 11:38 AM - Ricky: collin
8/18/18, 11:38 AM - Ricky: god damn

8/19/18, 4:03 PM - Ricky: hahaah
8/19/18, 4:03 PM - Ricky: the sex tape?
8/19/18, 4:03 PM - Alex Starr: Not nearly that far lol

8/19/18, 4:03 PM - Alex Starr: I thought collin was gonna put it on his finsta but I guess he decided against it
8/19/18, 4:08 PM - Alex Starr: Would’ve been a nice escalation from the blueberry video tho lol

8/19/18, 5:16 PM - Parker: So you’re saying you don’t remember most of the night then😂
8/19/18, 5:16 PM - Matt Casali: Yes but because I was asleep
8/19/18, 5:16 PM - Matt Casali: Aren't you awake when you black out?
8/19/18, 5:17 PM - Parker: you can be blacked an awake if that’s what you’re saying
8/19/18, 5:17 PM - Parker: exactly haha
8/19/18, 5:18 PM - Matt Casali: So being blacked out is just being asleep?
8/19/18, 5:18 PM - Matt Casali: Cause in that case I've been blacked out a lot
8/19/18, 5:18 PM - Parker: Noo hahah
8/19/18, 5:19 PM - Matt Casali: I am confusion
8/19/18, 5:19 PM - Parker: i said this because u were asleep so early

8/19/18, 5:24 PM - Ricky: When no one asked for a vote 😂
8/19/18, 5:24 PM - Parker: Hahahaha

8/19/18, 9:33 PM - Alex Starr: 3
8/19/18, 9:34 PM - Alex Starr: I get out of whatever class I have at 3

8/19/18, 9:39 PM - Ricky: plan is ever evolving
8/19/18, 9:39 PM - Ricky: vaughn and i for sure
8/19/18, 9:39 PM - Ricky: pman, you should try and get work off!!! :D
8/19/18, 9:40 PM - Alex Starr: If I can be picked up at 3:30, I’m down
8/19/18, 9:41 PM - Alex Starr: But I don’t really wanna miss class considering I’m already inherently missing class
8/19/18, 9:49 PM - Parker: i don’t have work until 2:30 on saturday so i’m chillin there
8/19/18, 9:49 PM - Parker: but still have my bday dinner friday night at 6

8/19/18, 9:52 PM - Collin Hurst: I'll just ask to leave work early on Friday
8/19/18, 9:52 PM - Alex Starr: Well then you can definitely get me haha
8/19/18, 9:52 PM - Alex Starr: There’s nothing special about 3:30
8/19/18, 9:54 PM - Alex Starr: So if you have to work later no big deal I can catch the cs webcast
8/19/18, 9:58 PM - Ricky: Oh shit I forgot!
8/19/18, 9:58 PM - Ricky: Alex I lied, you aren’t on the way really
8/19/18, 9:59 PM - Alex Starr: To what extent am I not on the way
8/19/18, 9:59 PM - Alex Starr: If it’s full blown opposite then I don’t wanna make collin come
8/19/18, 9:59 PM - Parker: wait what do u mean 3:30 alex?
8/19/18, 9:59 PM - Parker: like leaving friday?

8/19/18, 10:00 PM - Parker: can u send me where it actually is
8/19/18, 10:00 PM - Alex Starr: This would help
8/19/18, 10:00 PM - Alex Starr: Also Ricky I could train to somewhere on the way
8/19/18, 10:00 PM - Collin Hurst: It's close but cause of traffic it would add almost 2 hours
8/19/18, 10:00 PM - Alex Starr: But would vastly prefer to be picked up
8/19/18, 10:01 PM - Alex Starr: Jesus
8/19/18, 10:01 PM - Alex Starr: Wait so it would add 2 hours to a 2.5 hour trip
8/19/18, 10:01 PM - Collin Hurst: Probs less
8/19/18, 10:01 PM - Alex Starr: But a lot
8/19/18, 10:01 PM - Parker: Where is it??

8/19/18, 10:05 PM - Collin Hurst: If you caould take the Bart south a lil I'll pick you up
8/19/18, 10:05 PM - Alex Starr: I’ll mull it over

8/23/18, 9:55 AM - Alex Starr: I am
8/23/18, 10:28 AM - Alex Starr: Is it just me or are we Matt’s instagram substitute?
8/23/18, 10:28 AM - Alex Starr: Methadone if you will
8/23/18, 10:30 AM - Parker: Haha
8/23/18, 10:30 AM - Parker: he posts some on his finsta
8/23/18, 10:30 AM - Alex Starr: Well yeah he’s never been great at cold turkey
8/23/18, 11:00 AM - Darren: Wait, he's off insta but still has a finsta?
8/23/18, 11:03 AM - Collin Hurst: Yup
8/23/18, 11:17 AM - Alex Starr: I don’t think that counts
8/23/18, 11:18 AM - Darren: This entire time?
8/23/18, 11:18 AM - Ricky: Yup
8/23/18, 11:19 AM - Ricky: I’ll be back at 1:40 so if anyone free then HMU
8/23/18, 11:20 AM - Alex Starr: All that talk and...
8/23/18, 11:27 AM - Ricky: And what? He did cut down! By a large amount
8/23/18, 11:27 AM - Ricky: U ain’t even on insta son
8/23/18, 11:28 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah so I did what matt couldn’t lol
8/23/18, 11:29 AM - Ricky: Nawwww
8/23/18, 11:29 AM - Ricky: It’s not the same thing
8/23/18, 11:30 AM - Collin Hurst: You can't leave insta and your 700 followers if you never had them
8/23/18, 11:30 AM - Darren: Technically true
8/23/18, 11:31 AM - Ricky: It’s like saying I’m better at not doing coke coke than an addict if I’ve never done it before and don’t have access to it
8/23/18, 11:31 AM - Ricky: It’s true, but not worth any congratulations haha
8/23/18, 11:33 AM - Darren: But when you say you quit coke and it turns out you still take coke, just with a smaller venue of people, it's a little confusing
8/23/18, 11:33 AM - Ricky: Haha no doubt, I’m just saying, alex shouldn’t revel in what “matt couldn’t” haha
8/23/18, 11:33 AM - Alex Starr: I’m not at all
8/23/18, 11:34 AM - Alex Starr: Darren put it well I was just trying to dodge drug analogies
8/23/18, 11:34 AM - Ricky: Lol, well that didn’t go well 😂
8/23/18, 11:34 AM - Ricky: For me
8/23/18, 11:35 AM - Alex Starr: It’s sort of how in tv shows the drug user announces very heavily that they’ve stopped, but instead they are doing drugs wearing a cheap fake mustache now
8/23/18, 11:36 AM - Ricky: Haha wut tv is that?
8/23/18, 12:19 PM - Parker: hahaha what
8/23/18, 12:33 PM - Alex Starr: That is a classic trope
8/23/18, 12:59 PM - Matt Casali: Never said I quit instagram
8/23/18, 12:59 PM - Matt Casali: Just said I deleted the main account
8/23/18, 1:00 PM - Matt Casali: Good thing I didnt take coke
8/23/18, 1:00 PM - Darren: You said you deleted instagram
8/23/18, 1:00 PM - Matt Casali: And then I redownloaded
8/23/18, 1:00 PM - Matt Casali: No surprise there
8/23/18, 1:00 PM - Matt Casali: I'm just using it in much smaller doses now
8/23/18, 1:01 PM - Collin Hurst: Lol
8/23/18, 1:01 PM - Darren: But not having a 'main' account doesn't do anything to stop you using the discover page
8/23/18, 1:01 PM - Alex Starr: ^
8/23/18, 1:01 PM - Darren: Which was the problem iirc
8/23/18, 1:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: WHATTUP
8/23/18, 1:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: just got back from camping
8/23/18, 1:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: Who wants to go hits some balls with me and rick today?

8/23/18, 1:44 PM - Matt Casali: @draegers #swoopsomestuff
8/23/18, 1:45 PM - Matt Casali: It's not a problem anymore so something worked
8/23/18, 1:45 PM - Collin Hurst: Is marina Cunningham the marina?
8/23/18, 1:45 PM - Matt Casali: Maybe it's just because I play BOTW in my free time now
8/23/18, 1:45 PM - Matt Casali: Nah its Marina Hindman
8/23/18, 1:46 PM - Matt Casali: Marina Cunningham is not my type at all haha
8/23/18, 1:48 PM - Parker: matt likes the brunettes

8/23/18, 1:58 PM - Ricky: Just got home and immediately appreciate the concept of leftovers I my life
8/23/18, 2:00 PM - Alex Starr: Quite possibly what I miss the most
8/23/18, 2:00 PM - Alex Starr: I’m so damn hungry

8/23/18, 2:01 PM - Ricky: and was gonna leave anyway
8/23/18, 2:02 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah I don’t have much of a meal plan (like 1 meal every 2 days) and I made some pumpkin apple cinnamon rolls and the struggle to not casually eat them all is real
8/23/18, 2:30 PM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
8/23/18, 2:35 PM - Ricky: Lolol gl
8/23/18, 2:44 PM - Alex Starr: Thanks haha

8/23/18, 3:42 PM - Darren: What
8/23/18, 3:42 PM - Matt Casali: Fear of missing out
8/23/18, 3:43 PM - Matt Casali: Snapchat officials have decided that they dont want people to see what other people are doing all the time
8/23/18, 3:43 PM - Darren: I know what fomo means

8/25/18, 1:41 PM - Alex Starr: I just want to put it out there that Collin’s insta is “Hurstswurstburstsfirst” for the next week
8/25/18, 1:45 PM - Matt Casali: Ayyyyyyy
8/25/18, 1:46 PM - Matt Casali: What's your next quest alex?
8/25/18, 1:50 PM - Alex Starr: Eh they are all much more intractable apparently
8/25/18, 3:48 PM - Parker: hahaha actually?
8/25/18, 9:08 PM - Collin Hurst: Eh fook inside lands anyone want to hang
8/25/18, 9:36 PM - Alex Starr: Berkeley is nice
8/25/18, 9:38 PM - Collin Hurst: I'd be down one of these weekends to come up for a night
8/25/18, 9:46 PM - Tim Ko: Do it!!
8/25/18, 9:52 PM - Alex Starr: That’s what I like to hear
8/25/18, 10:27 PM - Matt Casali: ^
8/25/18, 10:28 PM - Alex Starr: It should either be next weekend or the weekend after before midterms start killing people
8/25/18, 10:32 PM - Darren: When is that second one
8/25/18, 10:33 PM - Alex Starr: As in date range?
8/25/18, 10:34 PM - Darren: 'The weekend after before midterms start killing people' does not help me narrow in on a date
8/25/18, 10:34 PM - Alex Starr: Put a comma after “after”
8/25/18, 10:35 PM - Darren: Ah
8/25/18, 10:35 PM - Alex Starr: Ya so two weeks from now
8/25/18, 10:36 PM - Darren: I think I'm down for either. I'll have a better sense of my schedule after Tuesday
8/25/18, 10:36 PM - Alex Starr: Makes sense and sounds good
8/25/18, 10:40 PM - Parker: I’m down!
8/25/18, 10:40 PM - Parker: a week from monday is my last day at work so maybe the weekend after this one?
8/25/18, 10:42 PM - Alex Starr: I’ll have to check how fucked my schedule will be by then
8/25/18, 10:43 PM - Alex Starr: Sooner is better probably
8/25/18, 10:44 PM - Tim Ko: Gang gang
8/25/18, 10:44 PM - Tim Ko: Come through
8/25/18, 10:59 PM - Parker: Well we only got like 2 weekends left anyways haha
8/26/18, 1:13 AM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>

8/26/18, 9:51 AM - Matt Casali: I love that
8/26/18, 9:54 AM - Ricky: It made me laugh so much haha
8/26/18, 10:15 AM - Parker: hahaha
8/26/18, 10:53 AM - Vaughn: Tahoe after our sunset photoshoot
8/26/18, 11:13 AM - Alex Starr: Jason I left my phone charger in your car.  If you see someone who’s planning on coming up to cal can you give it to them? Thanks
8/26/18, 1:25 PM - Ricky: Ohhhhh right that was after tim and I left
8/26/18, 1:25 PM - Ricky: Well I loved it
8/26/18, 1:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: Worst case scenario I can help you by Christmas
8/26/18, 1:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: Should i drop it off at your house in the mean time?
8/26/18, 1:43 PM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
8/26/18, 1:43 PM - Collin Hurst: You're a high exposure
8/26/18, 1:43 PM - Collin Hurst: Doesnt look that great on camera my ass
8/26/18, 1:45 PM - Darren: Looks better on camera
8/26/18, 1:46 PM - Darren: Looks like it's half way to the panther realm
8/26/18, 2:44 PM - Vaughn: Holy shit that looks great on camera
8/26/18, 2:44 PM - Vaughn: I meant the camera screen btw
8/26/18, 2:58 PM - Alex Starr: Guys this is really important
8/26/18, 2:58 PM - Alex Starr: What is the best reason u can think of to request that someone move a final exam?
8/26/18, 2:59 PM - Tim Ko: 3 finals in a day
8/26/18, 3:02 PM - Matt Casali: A's postgame live will be on during that time
8/26/18, 3:02 PM - Alex Starr: No seriously
8/26/18, 3:02 PM - Alex Starr: If I can’t generate a good lie I’m fucked
8/26/18, 3:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Family emergency
8/26/18, 3:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Better than pet emergency
8/26/18, 3:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: But leave it to their imagination
8/26/18, 3:09 PM - Alex Starr: Those are pretty common excuses and they are on the lookout
8/26/18, 3:10 PM - Alex Starr: Plus I need it to be not sudden
8/26/18, 3:12 PM - Vaughn: Jury duty
8/26/18, 3:13 PM - Vaughn: Wait do you not think having an overlapping final is a good enough excuse?
8/26/18, 3:17 PM - Collin Hurst: ^
8/26/18, 3:17 PM - Darren: They don't let you use overlapping final as an acceptable excuse
8/26/18, 3:19 PM - Collin Hurst: Why lol
8/26/18, 3:19 PM - Matt Casali: To be fair, you should have seen that coming
8/26/18, 3:19 PM - Collin Hurst: Have two finals at the same time is not a good excuse to not be able to show up to both ?
8/26/18, 3:20 PM - Darren: I imagine they don't want you to take concurrent classes because that means you'll never show up to one of them
8/26/18, 3:20 PM - Collin Hurst: Probs true
8/26/18, 3:20 PM - Collin Hurst: But I thought most colleges just don't even let you do that in the first place
8/26/18, 3:20 PM - Collin Hurst: The portals for UCSC and deanza won't even let you
8/26/18, 3:20 PM - Darren: You can't accidentally have overlapping finals, it has to be because of a schedule conflict
8/26/18, 3:20 PM - Darren: You can if you appeal / talk to a counselor
8/26/18, 3:21 PM - Vaughn: Find a funeral invite online and photoshop the date
8/26/18, 3:21 PM - Darren: But UCSC is more relaxed than Berkeley about this kind of stuff
8/26/18, 3:29 PM - Alex Starr: Thanks matt
8/26/18, 3:30 PM - Alex Starr: Only my cs professor has explicitly banned this
8/26/18, 3:30 PM - Alex Starr: So I think I’ll email my math professor and be honest.  If that fails, I’ll probably have to drop math
8/26/18, 3:31 PM - Alex Starr: And possibly throw in some last ditch lying my ass off to my cs professor
8/26/18, 3:31 PM - Alex Starr: But what is really unfortunate is that it isn’t guaranteed I get into CS yet
8/26/18, 3:33 PM - Darren: When would you know
8/26/18, 3:34 PM - Alex Starr: Idk but presumably before the drop deadline
8/26/18, 3:35 PM - Darren: That would make sense
8/26/18, 3:36 PM - Alex Starr: Too bad it isn’t the bio classes.  Might’ve been able to take 1 then run to the other room
8/26/18, 3:40 PM - Matt Casali: This is the way to go
8/26/18, 3:43 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah still annoying cs won’t move it
8/26/18, 3:46 PM - Alex Starr: Failing to take both simultaneously doesn’t fuck things too badly, but there is at least some light hand stuff
8/26/18, 3:46 PM - Alex Starr: And not getting into CS really bones things
8/26/18, 3:48 PM - Alex Starr: Tho either way, it throws challenging myself a lot and graduating in 7 semesters out the window
8/26/18, 4:41 PM - Alex Starr: Only cuz I can’t think of a good lie
8/26/18, 4:44 PM - Collin Hurst: You have an open brain surgery
8/26/18, 4:45 PM - Darren: You're operating an open brain surgery
8/26/18, 4:54 PM - Alex Starr: They’d want a doctors note for sure
8/26/18, 4:55 PM - Darren: Get Tim to write it
8/26/18, 4:55 PM - Tim Ko: Ricky’s Mom could get one
8/26/18, 4:58 PM - Alex Starr: I am enrolled in cs
8/26/18, 4:58 PM - Alex Starr: Officially
8/26/18, 5:12 PM - Alex Starr: Turns out I also misread some prerequisites.  I might just drop math
8/26/18, 5:49 PM - Parker: the best option tbh
8/27/18, 12:24 PM - Collin Hurst: did you guys hear about the twitch shooting
8/27/18, 12:24 PM - Vaughn: Yeah crazy
8/27/18, 12:25 PM - Darren: The Madden tournament?
8/27/18, 12:25 PM - Collin Hurst: Have you seen the clip
8/27/18, 12:25 PM - Darren: Or did twitch get shot up
8/27/18, 12:25 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah

8/27/18, 12:25 PM - Collin Hurst: but first shooting to streamed on twitch
8/27/18, 12:27 PM - Tim Ko: Oh shit
8/27/18, 12:27 PM - Darren: The laser on his chest is insane
8/27/18, 12:27 PM - Parker: yeah i saw that clip
8/27/18, 12:27 PM - Collin Hurst: you cant see anything on the camera but you can hear sounds and the laser
8/27/18, 12:27 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah its crazy
8/27/18, 12:28 PM - Parker: scary
8/27/18, 12:37 PM - Vaughn: Just bought infinity war to watch on flight, turns out they already have it on the plane for free
8/27/18, 12:40 PM - Collin Hurst: nice
8/27/18, 12:47 PM - Darren: <Media omitted>
8/27/18, 12:48 PM - Collin Hurst: lol
8/27/18, 12:56 PM - Ricky: hahahaah
8/27/18, 1:03 PM - Parker: hahaha
8/27/18, 1:03 PM - Parker: they know what’s coming👀
8/27/18, 1:03 PM - Collin Hurst: 👀👀👀
8/27/18, 1:13 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lol tf is 7% off

8/27/18, 2:25 PM - Parker: Matt when’s your last day at work?

8/27/18, 3:22 PM - Alex Starr: You’re rather chipper
8/27/18, 3:23 PM - Matt Casali: I'm hiding my sadness and loneliness behind a facade of jubilee
8/27/18, 3:23 PM - Alex Starr: Jubilance
8/27/18, 3:27 PM - Matt Casali: Thank you
8/27/18, 4:27 PM - Ricky: It’s gonna be so fun matt!!!! Your gonna make hundreds of new friends
8/27/18, 4:27 PM - Darren: Optimistic
8/27/18, 4:43 PM - Parker: aw i wanted to visit one more time

8/27/18, 4:46 PM - Ricky: Correct

8/27/18, 8:28 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah that'd be cool
8/27/18, 8:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Sounds fun
8/27/18, 8:29 PM - Alex Starr: I ask because my plans will change if we hang out then
8/27/18, 8:30 PM - Matt Casali: You got any ideas for what to do?
8/27/18, 8:31 PM - Alex Starr: No that’s not my department
8/27/18, 8:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: Play a old video game
8/27/18, 8:31 PM - Matt Casali: Petition to not hang out unless alex decides on half of what we do
8/27/18, 8:32 PM - Alex Starr: I mean that if there is something specific we want to do, I will go. Otherwise, I will not.  I’d be down to hang Saturday as well.
8/27/18, 8:34 PM - Matt Casali: 9 out of 10 professionals agree that suggesting something to do for a hang out is the most successful motivator for a gathering to occur
8/27/18, 8:37 PM - Ricky: Won’t you be in Rome?
8/27/18, 8:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yes but I'm helping!
8/27/18, 8:37 PM - Ricky: Good man
8/27/18, 8:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
8/27/18, 8:37 PM - Ricky: That is a very good idea
8/27/18, 8:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: Right??!
8/27/18, 8:40 PM - Matt Casali: I appreciate the contributions
8/27/18, 8:40 PM - Alex Starr: I’m not pushing for a hangout, I’d be down to do Saturday Sunday or Monday

8/27/18, 8:42 PM - Matt Casali: I got Mario kart! We could play two people at a time
8/27/18, 8:42 PM - Ricky: “Foul ball” “you’re out!”

8/27/18, 8:46 PM - Matt Casali: 🎅🏻🤶🏿
8/27/18, 8:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: Like using the gif of a black person who is very expressive to showcase your reaction when you white
8/27/18, 8:46 PM - Alex Starr: Explain what it is
8/27/18, 8:46 PM - Matt Casali: I'm stopping here
8/27/18, 8:46 PM - Alex Starr: Oh
8/27/18, 8:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: I dont think matt should do the black power fist but gifs are fine imo
8/27/18, 8:47 PM - Alex Starr: I do not agree nor do I do that
8/27/18, 8:47 PM - Ricky: Should or shouldn’t? Haha
8/27/18, 8:48 PM - Parker: You will NOT guess who came into the melt today
8/27/18, 8:48 PM - Parker: @grahampeeps
8/27/18, 8:48 PM - Matt Casali: Alexis Kanerva
8/27/18, 8:48 PM - Darren: Willem complained at me about that
8/27/18, 8:48 PM - Parker: MR MULKEY

8/27/18, 8:49 PM - Parker: he’s the exact same
8/27/18, 8:49 PM - Matt Casali: Everyone saw it coming
8/27/18, 8:49 PM - Parker: except his kid is old af
8/27/18, 8:49 PM - Alex Starr: ^
8/27/18, 8:49 PM - Alex Starr: Aleksis* (I think?)

8/27/18, 8:56 PM - Alex Starr: Jason do u think cultural appropriation is a useful/meaningful term in any context?
8/27/18, 8:56 PM - Matt Casali: *ahem* the culture in power cannot be culturally appropriated
8/27/18, 8:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: Wym?
8/27/18, 8:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: Useful?
8/27/18, 8:58 PM - Alex Starr: Meaningful then
8/27/18, 8:58 PM - Matt Casali: Like does it mean anything or is it something that libtards made up just like nazis
8/27/18, 8:59 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz I think it’s really dumb
8/27/18, 9:00 PM - Matt Casali: I think it's kinda like white spaces and black spaces
8/27/18, 9:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh i respect it
8/27/18, 9:00 PM - Matt Casali: But that could be completely bs too
8/27/18, 9:00 PM - Matt Casali: Who knows
8/27/18, 9:00 PM - Matt Casali: Probably god
8/27/18, 9:02 PM - Jason Greenberg: If something is important to a minority culture, it isn't hurting someone, and people are vocal about it, like hoop earings, let them have it come on
8/27/18, 9:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Symbols are powerful man
8/27/18, 9:03 PM - Matt Casali: But what if I _really_ want it
8/27/18, 9:04 PM - Alex Starr: I kinda see the space thing but the appropriation thing not so much
8/27/18, 9:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: If symbols are unimportant then yeah its not important
8/27/18, 9:05 PM - Alex Starr: You’ll have to elaborate to prove that one
8/27/18, 9:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: Thats not an absolute statement i suppose
8/27/18, 9:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: Idk i feel like if you already have all the good cards then you gotta let people have victories like cultural appropriation
8/27/18, 9:08 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t buy into that
8/27/18, 9:08 PM - Alex Starr: Assimilation is good at this point
8/27/18, 9:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: I see the value of that
8/27/18, 9:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: But also give it a few more generations for when we can't tell races apart and it wont be an issue
8/27/18, 9:09 PM - Alex Starr: It’ll be a much longer time
8/27/18, 9:09 PM - Matt Casali: ^
8/27/18, 9:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ok but thats nitpicking
8/27/18, 9:10 PM - Alex Starr: I remember I said “white people wont exist in 500 years” in a Socratic seminar and got come down on hard lol
8/27/18, 9:10 PM - Matt Casali: But assimilation needs to start now!
8/27/18, 9:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha
8/27/18, 9:10 PM - Alex Starr: No by that logic, global warming isn’t important either
8/27/18, 9:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ah i see
8/27/18, 9:11 PM - Matt Casali: I mean obviously its not
8/27/18, 9:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: Go write someone up for weed smell
8/27/18, 9:12 PM - Alex Starr: ^

8/31/18, 1:58 PM - Tim Ko: I don’t think so
8/31/18, 1:59 PM - Collin Hurst: What about the guy that dressed up in riot gear that was separate?
8/31/18, 1:59 PM - Tim Ko: I bet they put that on their resume
8/31/18, 1:59 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah probs
8/31/18, 1:59 PM - Tim Ko: “Made fake bomb threats to high school to bring awareness to social justice”
8/31/18, 1:59 PM - Collin Hurst: good PR experience
8/31/18, 1:59 PM - Parker: that was separate
8/31/18, 1:59 PM - Parker: that was like our sophomore or junior year
8/31/18, 1:59 PM - Collin Hurst: you can put anything on your resume
8/31/18, 1:59 PM - Parker: yeah for a bit i think
8/31/18, 2:00 PM - Parker: like a week or something
8/31/18, 2:00 PM - Tim Ko: Also shout out to student labor unions cuz my first semester they didn’t pay us at all for tutoring and now they pay us even for reviewing material on our own time gang gang
8/31/18, 2:00 PM - Collin Hurst: kinda like our random intern that is just doing office space stuff for us put SWE intern on his linked in and pretends that he actually contributs
8/31/18, 2:00 PM - Collin Hurst: but no he doesn
8/31/18, 2:00 PM - Collin Hurst: fuck that guy

8/31/18, 2:09 PM - Ricky: They went to juvey
8/31/18, 2:38 PM - Alex Starr: Why is the one good office character playing jack ryan?
8/31/18, 2:40 PM - Collin Hurst: yea I don't think its a good fit
8/31/18, 2:41 PM - Alex Starr: All I can think is “oh it’s that guy who looks like the actor from chuck”
8/31/18, 2:42 PM - Collin Hurst: he also doesnt have a sharp enough face for it
8/31/18, 2:42 PM - Collin Hurst: round cheeks
8/31/18, 2:42 PM - Alex Starr: Weirdly enough, that is exactly what I was thinking
8/31/18, 2:43 PM - Alex Starr: Tho I would use “angular”
8/31/18, 2:44 PM - Alex Starr: I’ll still see it tho
8/31/18, 3:46 PM - Parker: rickhows the video coming
8/31/18, 3:48 PM - Ricky: It’s coming
8/31/18, 3:48 PM - Ricky: But school

8/31/18, 3:49 PM - Collin Hurst: how was it looking though is it at least kinda cool
8/31/18, 3:51 PM - Ricky: I’d like to think it was but we’ll see haha
8/31/18, 3:58 PM - Parker: sick
8/31/18, 4:18 PM - Vaughn: So the first day we got here we had to rent our motorcycles. The rental company delivered 4 bikes to our villa and gave us all the details/tested out the bikes. Matt magana and I got on two of the bikes, tested em out by driving up the road and back, pretty comfortable ride. We pass the bikes to matt schurz and ed and they simultaneously crash both bikes 3 seconds after getting on
8/31/18, 4:22 PM - Collin Hurst: Lol what did they damage them
8/31/18, 4:22 PM - Vaughn: Ed let go of the bike when he accelrated and broke our neighbors potted plants/the front light on his bike, matthew kept accerating and slided across a side wall and broke the mirror/scratched the bike up/scratched himself up
8/31/18, 4:24 PM - Vaughn: The dudes that were renting them to us were watching us the whole time and got super quite, it was hella awkward so we decided to only rent 2 bikes for matt and I to drive the bimbos and the damage costs ended up being a little less than the cost of renting the extra bikes
8/31/18, 4:24 PM - Collin Hurst: wtf
8/31/18, 4:24 PM - Collin Hurst: noobs
8/31/18, 4:24 PM - Matt Casali: God damn
8/31/18, 4:29 PM - Collin Hurst: oof, what are they doing for transportation then
8/31/18, 4:30 PM - Vaughn: 2 people on each bike
8/31/18, 4:32 PM - Collin Hurst: lit
8/31/18, 4:32 PM - Collin Hurst: how is it so far tho, food, weather etc
8/31/18, 4:32 PM - Collin Hurst: are all the village people swarming you
8/31/18, 4:33 PM - Vaughn: All in all it works out because its pretty freakin dangerous driving out here and schurz would have likely killed himself driving
8/31/18, 4:48 PM - Parker: lol damn😂
8/31/18, 4:50 PM - Tim Ko: Natural selection
8/31/18, 4:50 PM - Tim Ko: Will always have shitty drivers unless u weed them out
8/31/18, 4:51 PM - Collin Hurst: ie Bangladesh
8/31/18, 4:53 PM - Vaughn: Weathers good, its said it was gunna rain all week but never did, clouds come and pass super humid and hot when the sun shows. Food is fire, especially the fried rice. The locals are hella nice and everyone is always staring at us. Tinder game is on fire. Boutta finally go to the main strip/touristy area for the beaches and we're gunna club with some super cute germans we met on the volcano
8/31/18, 4:56 PM - Parker: nice!
8/31/18, 4:56 PM - Parker: Oooooo
8/31/18, 4:56 PM - Collin Hurst: oooo tinder boof or what

8/31/18, 5:08 PM - Collin Hurst: I wish I had pics
8/31/18, 5:09 PM - Collin Hurst: I was on tinder for the first time since May and I couldn't update my profile cause I took literally no good pics this summer so sad
8/31/18, 5:09 PM - Vaughn: Lots of instagram worthy ones on my part, and these guys makin me feel like a model with the pics theyve taken of me
8/31/18, 5:12 PM - Collin Hurst: you are a model vaughn don't let anyone tell you different
8/31/18, 5:16 PM - Parker: hahaha
8/31/18, 5:16 PM - Parker: only because we take literally no pictures
8/31/18, 5:16 PM - Parker: ^
8/31/18, 5:16 PM - Collin Hurst: cause we have confidence and don't need ressurance
8/31/18, 5:18 PM - Vaughn: But like, we were literally the last people out of hundreds on the top of the mountain taking pics
8/31/18, 5:54 PM - Parker: Tru
8/31/18, 6:17 PM - Alex Starr: The appropriate number of pictures
8/31/18, 6:18 PM - Collin Hurst: I think we should take a few more than we usually do tho
8/31/18, 6:18 PM - Alex Starr: Are we taking -a few usually?
8/31/18, 6:18 PM - Parker: we definitely should
8/31/18, 6:18 PM - Parker: it’s weird
8/31/18, 6:19 PM - Alex Starr: We shouldn’t take more because it’s weird tho
8/31/18, 6:19 PM - Alex Starr: Plus we shouldn’t take more
8/31/18, 6:19 PM - Collin Hurst: alex shush
8/31/18, 6:19 PM - Alex Starr: Appreciate the transitive ephemerality
8/31/18, 6:20 PM - Alex Starr: Collin shut the fuck up
8/31/18, 6:21 PM - Parker: why
8/31/18, 6:21 PM - Parker: it’s a normal thing friends do
8/31/18, 6:21 PM - Matt Casali: But we're not normal
8/31/18, 6:21 PM - Parker: it’s weird when i’m at school and can’t look back at any pics of us lol
8/31/18, 6:21 PM - Parker: except the ones when u literally came to my schhool😂
8/31/18, 6:21 PM - Matt Casali: Take more pics then
8/31/18, 6:21 PM - Matt Casali: I just hate standing for pictures if we're doing something else haha
8/31/18, 6:22 PM - Matt Casali: Candid or not at all
8/31/18, 6:23 PM - Alex Starr: Thanks Voltaire
8/31/18, 6:23 PM - Parker: that’s fine
8/31/18, 6:23 PM - Alex Starr: Ya we can’t stop you
8/31/18, 6:24 PM - Parker: i do
8/31/18, 6:24 PM - Parker: but like group pics
8/31/18, 6:25 PM - Collin Hurst: we didnt say posed or anything
8/31/18, 6:25 PM - Collin Hurst: wow someone is very stern with their picture opinions
8/31/18, 6:26 PM - Tim Ko: I think less pics is not always bad
8/31/18, 6:26 PM - Alex Starr: You have to pose for a group picture
8/31/18, 6:26 PM - Alex Starr: It’s the same as shush haha
8/31/18, 6:26 PM - Tim Ko: Think of the only pic of ur grandpa from the 1940s
8/31/18, 6:26 PM - Tim Ko: Ur gonna cherish that one cuz there are no others
8/31/18, 6:26 PM - Alex Starr: Tim ur argument has me wanting more pictures
8/31/18, 6:26 PM - Collin Hurst: ok shush is vastly less aggressive than shut the fuck up lol
8/31/18, 6:26 PM - Parker: tf
8/31/18, 6:26 PM - Alex Starr: For me shush is more aggressive
8/31/18, 6:27 PM - Parker: emphasis on vastly
8/31/18, 6:27 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah tim wtf is this argument
8/31/18, 6:27 PM - Tim Ko: If u had 10,000 pics of ur grandpa when he was a teenager vs one, ur gonna value the one way more
8/31/18, 6:27 PM - Tim Ko: Or let’s say ur dad
8/31/18, 6:28 PM - Collin Hurst: yes but I would be sad that there aren't more pictures...
8/31/18, 6:28 PM - Parker: ^
8/31/18, 6:28 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah and that makes u value that one even more
8/31/18, 6:28 PM - Collin Hurst: the goal of this convo isnt to make our pictures more valuable
8/31/18, 6:28 PM - Tim Ko: Otherwise it wouldn’t be that special
8/31/18, 6:28 PM - Alex Starr: So tim if you had three kids should I kill 2 so that one is super special?
8/31/18, 6:28 PM - Tim Ko: Are pictures living things?
8/31/18, 6:28 PM - Parker: we’re just talking about quantity here
8/31/18, 6:28 PM - Parker: hahaha
8/31/18, 6:28 PM - Alex Starr: Abort*
8/31/18, 6:29 PM - Tim Ko: I hope ur joking with that analogy
8/31/18, 6:29 PM - Alex Starr: Triplets are on the way! “Well shit, can you abort two? I want that one to be special”
8/31/18, 6:29 PM - Collin Hurst: he sounds serious to me
8/31/18, 6:30 PM - Tim Ko: Think about the very few pics u have of ur great grandparents
8/31/18, 6:30 PM - Tim Ko: Now imagine u had 10,000 of them
8/31/18, 6:30 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t give a fuck about my great grand parents
8/31/18, 6:30 PM - Collin Hurst: that would be awesome
8/31/18, 6:30 PM - Parker: that would be cool
8/31/18, 6:31 PM - Parker: but also probably weren’t able to take that many lol
8/31/18, 6:31 PM - Alex Starr: They were all nazis racists and murderers
8/31/18, 6:31 PM - Collin Hurst: tim this is incredibly irrelevant
8/31/18, 6:31 PM - Collin Hurst: plz let us continue our conversation
8/31/18, 6:31 PM - Tim Ko: You would probably hang up a few and never look at the others
8/31/18, 6:31 PM - Tim Ko: Ok
8/31/18, 6:31 PM - Vaughn: Hahahaha
8/31/18, 6:31 PM - Parker: Lol
8/31/18, 6:31 PM - Collin Hurst: but I get your point lol
8/31/18, 6:31 PM - Alex Starr: My analogy was somehow more relevant
8/31/18, 6:32 PM - Tim Ko: All I know is that I have thousands of baby pictures and childhood pics I never look at
8/31/18, 6:32 PM - Tim Ko: But I only have a few pics of my parents when they were young
8/31/18, 6:32 PM - Alex Starr: All I know is that bananas are an excellent source of potassium
8/31/18, 6:32 PM - Parker: all i know is i have a lack of thousands of pictures of you guys that i don’t get to look at
8/31/18, 6:32 PM - Tim Ko: Those few pics I have are more valuable to me than my thousand pics
8/31/18, 6:32 PM - Ricky: I think both are fair points but honestly, this is a dumb convo
8/31/18, 6:32 PM - Ricky: Haha
8/31/18, 6:33 PM - Parker: because they don’t exist
8/31/18, 6:33 PM - Ricky: Both are valid
8/31/18, 6:33 PM - Ricky: Just so what u want
8/31/18, 6:33 PM - Ricky: Do*
8/31/18, 6:33 PM - Tim Ko: Alex made this dumb with his analogy
8/31/18, 6:33 PM - Parker: you’re a dumb convo
8/31/18, 6:33 PM - Alex Starr: All I know is I’m aborting the shit out of Ethan so Kayla feels special
8/31/18, 6:33 PM - Alex Starr: Oh I think you handled that all on your own haha
8/31/18, 6:33 PM - Parker: Dumb convo in this chat is redundant, no?
8/31/18, 6:33 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah but what if I want a valuable picture of my summer of 18? that would require taking more pictures
8/31/18, 6:33 PM - Alex Starr: Well played af
8/31/18, 6:33 PM - Collin Hurst: what if I want valuable pictures of most of the events I went to that would require more pictures also
8/31/18, 6:34 PM - Alex Starr: But then all those pictures don’t feel special
8/31/18, 6:34 PM - Alex Starr: Those poor mediocre unwanted photos
8/31/18, 6:34 PM - Collin Hurst: I don't give a fuck boi
8/31/18, 6:34 PM - Tim Ko: I never said taking more was bad, I just said taking less isn’t bad
8/31/18, 6:34 PM - Collin Hurst: I want a damn picture of that event
8/31/18, 6:35 PM - Parker: it would also help if we had a legit photographer
8/31/18, 6:35 PM - Alex Starr: All those unwanted pictures offing themselves?
8/31/18, 6:35 PM - Parker: #thehuntfor10
8/31/18, 6:35 PM - Darren: @matt
8/31/18, 6:35 PM - Alex Starr: We r hitting 8 way before 10
8/31/18, 6:35 PM - Collin Hurst: todd tankersly lets hire him to follow us around
8/31/18, 6:35 PM - Alex Starr: That is the last thing we need
8/31/18, 6:35 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah after seeing those paintings...

8/31/18, 6:38 PM - Alex Starr: On the leg and presto
8/31/18, 6:40 PM - Alex Starr: But the real question is, would the leg be more special if you plucked off the other 5?
8/31/18, 6:40 PM - Parker: haha stop
8/31/18, 6:41 PM - Alex Starr: Pass
8/31/18, 6:41 PM - Collin Hurst: ftr shush is more sarcastic and less aggressive than shut the fuck up

8/31/18, 6:42 PM - Alex Starr: I’m not a fan of being shushed
8/31/18, 6:42 PM - Alex Starr: It’s more serious
8/31/18, 6:42 PM - Alex Starr: You almost never say shut the fuck up seriously
8/31/18, 6:42 PM - Alex Starr: Stfu lol is a very common phrase
8/31/18, 6:43 PM - Collin Hurst: I think over text is not as bad as in real life
8/31/18, 6:43 PM - Collin Hurst: For shush
8/31/18, 6:43 PM - Tim Ko: I guess that doesn’t happen a lot to you
8/31/18, 6:44 PM - Ricky: This is much diff that shut the fuck up ahhaha
8/31/18, 6:44 PM - Alex Starr: But on the more pictures front, I don’t think anyone is stopping more from happening

8/31/18, 6:55 PM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>

8/31/18, 7:21 PM - Parker: tru
8/31/18, 7:21 PM - Parker: <Media omitted>
8/31/18, 7:22 PM - Collin Hurst: Can you do a normal face plz lol

8/31/18, 7:22 PM - Parker: <Media omitted>
8/31/18, 7:22 PM - Parker: no
8/31/18, 7:23 PM - Collin Hurst: Well then I cannot give a proper assessment
8/31/18, 7:23 PM - Parker: u definitely can
8/31/18, 7:23 PM - Parker: i can send all 5 if u need comparisons
8/31/18, 7:24 PM - Parker: but those are 98% the ones i’m getting
8/31/18, 7:25 PM - Collin Hurst: That pic is actually scary cause your eyes are not looking in the same spot
8/31/18, 7:26 PM - Parker: haha holy shit i didn’t notice that
8/31/18, 7:28 PM - Collin Hurst: But yeah looks good, pupils are in the center of the frame, the roundness of the bottom balances your squareish face, top rim sits in middle of eyebrows, width is good cause there's a little skin showing between the sides of your face but not too much, color is ok
8/31/18, 7:32 PM - Alex Starr: Do you need glasses?
8/31/18, 7:32 PM - Parker: gang thanks
8/31/18, 7:32 PM - Parker: i’ll show you the other ones tonight

8/31/18, 7:37 PM - Tim Ko: I think those look nice parker
8/31/18, 7:37 PM - Alex Starr: Tho the weird face really makes it tricky
8/31/18, 7:42 PM - Vaughn: <Media omitted>
8/31/18, 7:44 PM - Parker: stfu lol
8/31/18, 7:44 PM - Parker: thanks!
8/31/18, 7:47 PM - Collin Hurst: Have you tried same model different color frames?
8/31/18, 7:48 PM - Collin Hurst: I've heard with blue eyes brown frames look good
8/31/18, 7:50 PM - Parker: I don’t have the same ones in a different color
8/31/18, 7:50 PM - Parker: but have 4 other slightly different ones
8/31/18, 8:10 PM - Matt Casali: Haha those are the same reasons I got glasses

8/31/18, 8:49 PM - Alex Starr: What’s that mean? Is it the little piggy that ran all the way home?
8/31/18, 8:50 PM - Parker: only reason i’m doing it tbh
8/31/18, 8:50 PM - Matt Casali: I need a soundbyte from Vaughn
8/31/18, 8:50 PM - Parker: ^
8/31/18, 8:52 PM - Alex Starr: Instead of contacts?

9/11/18, 5:10 PM - Alex Starr: Ah okay
9/11/18, 5:11 PM - Alex Starr: To me, applying for something for which you are drastically unqualified is dishonest usually
9/11/18, 5:17 PM - Darren: Anything on your resume should be able to be backed up
9/11/18, 5:20 PM - Ricky: ^
9/11/18, 5:20 PM - Ricky: the guy that interviewed seems like the major dick in this situation

9/11/18, 5:22 PM - Darren: There are steps between resume and interview
9/11/18, 5:31 PM - Matt Casali: Should not pay the fine
9/11/18, 5:32 PM - Collin Hurst: but he will be taken to VCAT on a matter of principle!
9/11/18, 5:41 PM - Ricky: Hahahha
9/11/18, 5:41 PM - Ricky: If you are gonna lie you gotta face the consequences

9/12/18, 2:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: <Media omitted>
9/12/18, 2:00 PM - Collin Hurst: the brain thing?
9/12/18, 2:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah
9/12/18, 2:02 PM - Collin Hurst: i know its a thing but idk what it means
9/12/18, 2:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Well the original meaning of the painting is supposedly something about how god created the divine
9/12/18, 2:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Starting with adam
9/12/18, 2:03 PM - Collin Hurst: did you see this irl?
9/12/18, 2:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: But the brain discovery could mean that michelango was suggesting that man created the divine not god. Literally man created god
9/12/18, 2:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: Which would be total heresay for his time obvi
9/12/18, 2:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: Fuckin nuts

9/12/18, 2:19 PM - Jason Greenberg: Possibly. Why hide that tho?
9/12/18, 2:20 PM - Alex Starr: Isn’t necessarily hidden
9/12/18, 2:20 PM - Alex Starr: Lots of art has multiple meanings and layers
9/12/18, 2:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah
9/12/18, 2:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: I dont think accurate anatomy was common knowledge for a while
9/12/18, 2:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: With it being so scientific and all
9/12/18, 2:21 PM - Alex Starr: True but again lots of artistic motifs are not common knowledge

9/12/18, 11:10 PM - Parker: go to the shrooms truck
9/13/18, 1:38 AM - Tim Ko: Falling asleep is sometimes hard
9/13/18, 1:41 AM - Darren: s/is/I'm
9/13/18, 7:40 AM - Jason Greenberg: I understood the last two
9/13/18, 7:40 AM - Matt Casali: More than me
9/13/18, 8:07 AM - Ricky: i feel you timmy
9/13/18, 8:07 AM - Ricky: i dont do this cuz i dont wanna be addicted, but when it is essential, ive started taking melatonin (parker gave me some like freshman year for our gift exchange)
9/13/18, 8:08 AM - Ricky: i did last night cuz i had to be up early to study and I had not been sleeping well for the last few days so really needed the sleep, and it honestly helped a surprising amount
9/13/18, 8:10 AM - Jason Greenberg: It can def help reset your sleep schedule
9/13/18, 8:10 AM - Ricky: yeah, thats my hopes, cuz i had been going to bed too late
9/13/18, 8:11 AM - Jason Greenberg: Try staying out of your bed for most of the day until bed time. If the only thing you do in your bed is sleep, you associate it with sleep hella. This is my best method
9/13/18, 8:11 AM - Jason Greenberg: @tim
9/13/18, 8:11 AM - Jason Greenberg: Also sex is ok
9/13/18, 8:11 AM - Jason Greenberg: But not till you're married
9/13/18, 8:12 AM - Matt Casali: Outtanowhere
9/13/18, 8:14 AM - Ricky: ohhh yeaht thats a good idea! and try to not use screens when you are in bed, that is my weakness haha
9/13/18, 8:15 AM - Matt Casali: Or do it
9/13/18, 8:15 AM - Matt Casali: I do it and have no problem going to sleep
9/13/18, 8:18 AM - Ricky: damn, that some impressive self control
9/13/18, 8:18 AM - Jason Greenberg: I do it every day i cant not
9/13/18, 8:19 AM - Jason Greenberg: But that bluelight filter
9/13/18, 8:19 AM - Ricky: hahaha, for me, i could literally stay up all night watching videos if i dont actively say "ricky cuz this shit out and go to bed" haha
9/13/18, 8:19 AM - Ricky: adam builds shit!!!!!!
9/13/18, 8:19 AM - Ricky: i remember you falling asleep to that in tahoe like every night
9/13/18, 8:19 AM - Jason Greenberg: YESSS
9/13/18, 8:19 AM - Jason Greenberg: I DID IT LAST NIGHT
9/13/18, 8:19 AM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha
9/13/18, 8:19 AM - Ricky: HAAHAAHA
9/13/18, 8:19 AM - Ricky: I think they are too cool i dont wanna sleep through it
9/13/18, 8:20 AM - Jason Greenberg: Lolol its so relaxing!
9/13/18, 8:45 AM - Parker: you can blame your addiction on me
9/13/18, 9:00 AM - Alex Starr: Exercise during the day and not napping also help
9/13/18, 9:05 AM - Alex Starr: But not getting enough sleep is the worst
9/13/18, 9:07 AM - Alex Starr: I just feel so stupid on too little sleep
9/13/18, 9:12 AM - Matt Casali: I agree
9/13/18, 9:17 AM - Jason Greenberg: I agree
9/13/18, 9:18 AM - Alex Starr: Although what Jason said has been shown to be the best thing
9/13/18, 9:57 AM - Ricky: yeah, and that thing ricky said about screens was really smart
9/13/18, 9:58 AM - Alex Starr: ^
9/13/18, 10:03 AM - Parker: ^^
9/13/18, 10:03 AM - Parker: my dad always gets on me about that haha
9/13/18, 10:03 AM - Parker: even though it doesn’t impact my ability to fall asleep
9/13/18, 10:04 AM - Alex Starr: It might
9/13/18, 10:04 AM - Alex Starr: You might go out like a lamp without it
9/13/18, 10:05 AM - Parker: nah i’ve tried both
9/13/18, 10:05 AM - Parker: if anything it helps cuz it’s what i’m used to
9/13/18, 10:07 AM - Alex Starr: Correlation != causation
9/13/18, 10:11 AM - Ricky: to each their own
9/13/18, 10:11 AM - Ricky: i just knnow it helps me sleep, but i need betterr will power
9/13/18, 10:14 AM - Alex Starr: Think*
9/13/18, 10:19 AM - Ricky: true
9/13/18, 10:19 AM - Ricky: i need better will think
9/13/18, 10:24 AM - Parker: thank you
9/13/18, 10:24 AM - Parker: hahah
9/13/18, 11:04 AM - Collin Hurst: make sure youre going to bed at the same time
9/13/18, 11:04 AM - Tim Ko: Like don’t go on ur phone before sleeping?
9/13/18, 11:04 AM - Collin Hurst: that makes it 100x easier for me to fall asleep
9/13/18, 11:04 AM - Collin Hurst: dont go on your phone 30 mins before
9/13/18, 11:04 AM - Ricky: yeee thats what i meant
9/13/18, 11:04 AM - Tim Ko: On shit lol
9/13/18, 11:05 AM - Tim Ko: I end my day by going on my phone for at least 20-30 mins in bed
9/13/18, 11:05 AM - Ricky: which other rpeople do!
9/13/18, 11:05 AM - Alex Starr: If you do do that, turn on night mode
9/13/18, 11:05 AM - Alex Starr: And sleep at the same time every night
9/13/18, 11:05 AM - Ricky: it tjust kinda makes sense that staring at a brrright screen in the dark would keep you more awkae
9/13/18, 11:05 AM - Alex Starr: As Collin said
9/13/18, 11:05 AM - Alex Starr: It’s also scientifically backed up
9/13/18, 11:06 AM - Tim Ko: Oh hmmm let me do that
9/13/18, 11:07 AM - Darren: But sufficiently high r values...
9/13/18, 11:07 AM - Collin Hurst: but yeah if I go to bd earlier than usual I usually just end up not falling asleep untill my regular bedtime lol
9/13/18, 11:07 AM - Tim Ko: ^
9/13/18, 11:07 AM - Collin Hurst: just like an hour of thinking with my eyes closed lol
9/13/18, 11:07 AM - Tim Ko: That’s my problem
9/13/18, 11:07 AM - Tim Ko: !!!!!
9/13/18, 11:07 AM - Collin Hurst: yeah pop a melatonin then haha
9/13/18, 11:07 AM - Alex Starr: I don’t think we have them
9/13/18, 11:07 AM - Ricky: gang
9/13/18, 11:08 AM - Ricky: all comes back to square one
9/13/18, 11:08 AM - Tim Ko: Lol
9/13/18, 11:08 AM - Alex Starr: Tim you often also go to bed at like 1:00 or 2:00, so ur circadian shit gets stuck in that
9/13/18, 11:08 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah ik haha
9/13/18, 11:08 AM - Tim Ko: I’d like it so that I’m exauhsted by 12-12:30
9/13/18, 11:09 AM - Tim Ko: I guess I just gotta force myself to sleep earlier and wake up earlier
9/13/18, 11:09 AM - Alex Starr: Also exercising right before bed makes it very hard to sleep
9/13/18, 11:09 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah it takes a while
9/13/18, 11:09 AM - Tim Ko: I see
9/13/18, 11:09 AM - Alex Starr: For me the hard part is staying asleep
9/13/18, 11:09 AM - Tim Ko: Ahh I see
9/13/18, 11:09 AM - Tim Ko: That’s not a problem for me
9/13/18, 11:10 AM - Alex Starr: So I force myself to sleep very early cuz if I wake up early, I’m probably fucked
9/13/18, 11:10 AM - Collin Hurst: hard for me to fall alseep
9/13/18, 11:11 AM - Collin Hurst: I just don't get tired some days lol
9/13/18, 11:11 AM - Tim Ko: For sure
9/13/18, 11:13 AM - Alex Starr: I’m tired basically constantly haha
9/13/18, 11:14 AM - Jason Greenberg: I do this too
9/13/18, 11:14 AM - Alex Starr: But sleeping later I feel better so it’s a tricky situation
9/13/18, 11:15 AM - Jason Greenberg: Also less water right before bed because age and bladder strength seem to be inversely related
9/13/18, 11:15 AM - Collin Hurst: what
9/13/18, 11:15 AM - Alex Starr: I always have to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night
9/13/18, 11:15 AM - Darren: Water before bed is a difficult balance
9/13/18, 11:15 AM - Alex Starr: Also my room is bright af in the morning
9/13/18, 11:15 AM - Alex Starr: Either go all in and accept it, or go full desert mode
9/13/18, 11:15 AM - Collin Hurst: I always drink like 20oz water before bed
9/13/18, 11:16 AM - Jason Greenberg: Oh i wear a blindfold now
9/13/18, 11:16 AM - Jason Greenberg: Helps soo much
9/13/18, 11:16 AM - Ricky: alex you should try this
9/13/18, 11:16 AM - Ricky: its a game changer
9/13/18, 11:16 AM - Alex Starr: I may do that
9/13/18, 11:16 AM - Ricky: i dont do it alot but have and its wild
9/13/18, 11:16 AM - Collin Hurst: pretty sure thats not what they call it but yeah
9/13/18, 11:17 AM - Jason Greenberg: Some people have thinner eyelids than others + bright room = less sleep
9/13/18, 11:17 AM - Collin Hurst: sleeping in a room thats not comepletely dark can mess with you also I've heard
9/13/18, 11:17 AM - Jason Greenberg: Ear plugs when the roommates are coming home late = cash in my pocket
9/13/18, 11:18 AM - Collin Hurst: cash in pocket = vagina on peepee
9/13/18, 11:18 AM - Tim Ko: Wut^
9/13/18, 11:18 AM - Ricky: What are you up to now Jason? How’s time?
9/13/18, 11:19 AM - Alex Starr: He’s hiring whores
9/13/18, 11:20 AM - Tim Ko: Ohhh lol
9/13/18, 11:21 AM - Collin Hurst: sure that works
9/13/18, 11:23 AM - Ricky: Rome***
9/13/18, 11:23 AM - Ricky: Lol sry
9/13/18, 11:23 AM - Alex Starr: That makes so much more sense
9/13/18, 11:23 AM - Parker: hahaha
9/13/18, 11:23 AM - Collin Hurst: I thought he was asking like hows time treating you or something lol
9/13/18, 11:23 AM - Alex Starr: Same
9/13/18, 11:28 AM - Jason Greenberg: Father time has been goof
9/13/18, 11:28 AM - Jason Greenberg: good*
9/13/18, 11:29 AM - Jason Greenberg: Ive never really like relaxed this much at school before so this is pretty eye-opening
9/13/18, 11:30 AM - Alex Starr: Damn
9/13/18, 11:30 AM - Jason Greenberg: I hope i take it back with me
9/13/18, 11:30 AM - Alex Starr: It sounds good
9/13/18, 11:30 AM - Alex Starr: What concerns you so much while at school?
9/13/18, 11:32 AM - Jason Greenberg: The pressure is really on and I feel like i have to perform, but here it kind of seems like there's more to it than that. I want to travel and go out at night. I dont feel like i need to study like crazy also because there so much else to do
9/13/18, 11:32 AM - Alex Starr: Why do you feel like you have to perform? What motivates you? Curious cuz I’ve been reevaluating my motivation recently
9/13/18, 11:34 AM - Jason Greenberg: Getting into a good grad school cuz thats the most concrete step i can see
9/13/18, 11:34 AM - Alex Starr: What kind of grades do you think you need to get that?
9/13/18, 11:34 AM - Jason Greenberg: 3.6 3.7 or so
9/13/18, 11:35 AM - Jason Greenberg: I have a 3.5 rn so I'm not there
9/13/18, 11:35 AM - Alex Starr: Ah gotcha well I’m confident you can pull it off
9/13/18, 11:35 AM - Jason Greenberg: But I'm trying not to think about that rn
9/13/18, 11:35 AM - Alex Starr: Sorry
9/13/18, 11:35 AM - Jason Greenberg: Haha its ok
9/13/18, 11:35 AM - Alex Starr: Just curious
9/13/18, 11:36 AM - Jason Greenberg: What have you noticed about your motivation?
9/13/18, 11:39 AM - Alex Starr: It seems to have very little to do with learning/grad school/
9/13/18, 11:41 AM - Parker: Jason what traveling are u gonna do while there?
9/13/18, 11:41 AM - Jason Greenberg: Girls?
9/13/18, 11:41 AM - Alex Starr: Cuz if that was it, it wouldn’t bother me so much when I miss a little thing on a quiz or do well but had to prepare a lot in order to do well
9/13/18, 11:41 AM - Alex Starr: ? Haha.
9/13/18, 11:41 AM - Jason Greenberg: Tell u in a sec
9/13/18, 11:41 AM - Parker: Cuz if it’s not already planned i strongly recommend amsterdam
9/13/18, 11:41 AM - Alex Starr: U definitely should go to Florence
9/13/18, 11:42 AM - Alex Starr: Fuck Amsterdam
9/13/18, 11:42 AM - Parker: wrong
9/13/18, 11:42 AM - Alex Starr: Paris >>>>>>>> Amsterdam
9/13/18, 11:42 AM - Parker: he’s prob already been to florence lol
9/13/18, 11:42 AM - Jason Greenberg: Gonna do amsterdam prague berlin venice paris flourence so far
9/13/18, 11:42 AM - Parker: he’s in italy
9/13/18, 11:42 AM - Parker: Hell ya
9/13/18, 11:42 AM - Jason Greenberg: And almafi coast
9/13/18, 11:42 AM - Parker: prague looks so fucken sick
9/13/18, 11:43 AM - Parker: berlin too
9/13/18, 11:43 AM - Alex Starr: Was okay but not great imo.  But I’m not a beach person
9/13/18, 11:43 AM - Jason Greenberg: What do you feel like you dont have but want?
9/13/18, 11:43 AM - Alex Starr: I may study there over summer I’m contemplating
9/13/18, 11:43 AM - Jason Greenberg: Going to capri an island off the coast of naples
9/13/18, 11:43 AM - Jason Greenberg: Its supposed to be lit af
9/13/18, 11:44 AM - Alex Starr: I’m not sure seems to be about proving worth/ability and trying to be best
9/13/18, 11:44 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah I’d have to take one useless class and one useful one tho and idk if I have room.  Plus then no internship
9/13/18, 11:44 AM - Alex Starr: Where are u currently planning on going jason?
9/13/18, 11:45 AM - Collin Hurst: do a catch and cook with an octopus off the coast of naples
9/13/18, 11:45 AM - Jason Greenberg: As in valedictorian kind of best? Or like best at thing you do?
9/13/18, 11:45 AM - Parker: Ooooooo
9/13/18, 11:45 AM - Jason Greenberg: Those cities above
9/13/18, 11:45 AM - Tim Ko: Alex I feel like if u pursue any sort of biology u would have ur own lab in the future
9/13/18, 11:46 AM - Tim Ko: And that’s a really high accomplishment
9/13/18, 11:46 AM - Jason Greenberg: Def getting seafood
9/13/18, 11:46 AM - Tim Ko: Also Jason are u taking the same classes as Donya and grace
9/13/18, 11:46 AM - Tim Ko: Like do u see them often
9/13/18, 11:47 AM - Collin Hurst: we should go deep sea fishing sometime together
9/13/18, 11:47 AM - Jason Greenberg: Me and don will have the same classes in 2 weeks
9/13/18, 11:47 AM - Jason Greenberg: Fucking down af
9/13/18, 11:47 AM - Alex Starr: As in best bar nothing
9/13/18, 11:48 AM - Jason Greenberg: Less than i thought but still like a few times a week. I kind of have my own group but we all mingle and i see them at school most days
9/13/18, 11:48 AM - Collin Hurst: litt
9/13/18, 11:48 AM - Alex Starr: That wouldn’t feel like an accomplishment I think
9/13/18, 11:48 AM - Alex Starr: I hate fishing with a passion, but I’m down
9/13/18, 11:48 AM - Alex Starr: Tho I’ll be vomiting for 95% of it
9/13/18, 11:48 AM - Jason Greenberg: Where do you think that comes from?
9/13/18, 11:49 AM - Alex Starr: No idea
9/13/18, 11:49 AM - Jason Greenberg: Like i dont know your fam  v well
9/13/18, 11:49 AM - Jason Greenberg: Role models?
9/13/18, 11:49 AM - Collin Hurst: why you hate it
9/13/18, 11:50 AM - Collin Hurst: because deep sea fishing solves most of the reasons why I don't like fishing
9/13/18, 11:50 AM - Jason Greenberg: Lets do fucking spear fishing somewhere
9/13/18, 11:50 AM - Parker: same^^
9/13/18, 11:50 AM - Alex Starr: U just sit there for 95% of it plus I get horribly seasick
9/13/18, 11:50 AM - Collin Hurst: thats on my bucket list
9/13/18, 11:51 AM - Collin Hurst: and I don't have many things on my bucket list
9/13/18, 11:51 AM - Alex Starr: Both my parents are not very driven in that sort of way.  My dad especially
9/13/18, 11:51 AM - Collin Hurst: seasick I can't help you with but it would be a lot better with lots of friends
9/13/18, 11:52 AM - Collin Hurst: the sitting there part
9/13/18, 11:52 AM - Jason Greenberg: I guess i dont understand if you mean like renaissance man best kind of thing or like the best at the ladder drill in football
9/13/18, 11:52 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah I agre
9/13/18, 11:52 AM - Alex Starr: Agree
9/13/18, 11:53 AM - Alex Starr: Not really the football thing but best at a wide variety of things sure
9/13/18, 11:55 AM - Jason Greenberg: Well i dont mean to put words in your mouth
9/13/18, 11:56 AM - Alex Starr: Eh if you don’t I don’t talk much
9/13/18, 11:57 AM - Alex Starr: It’s difficult to view most anything as a success essentially which leads me to think that things I can succeed in aren’t really majorly motivating
9/13/18, 12:02 PM - Collin Hurst: so the only things that are motivating to you are the things you can't succeed in?
9/13/18, 12:05 PM - Alex Starr: Yes
9/13/18, 12:06 PM - Tim Ko: Think of everyone who doubted u along the way. The first grade teacher who said u were dumb, the 5th grade kid who took ur lunch money, ms papson for cutting u from the team. Show them that ur Alex damn Starr.
9/13/18, 12:06 PM - Alex Starr: I have a nasty habit of accomplishing tangible goals
9/13/18, 12:06 PM - Alex Starr: Wut lol
9/13/18, 12:07 PM - Tim Ko: I think most of us do that
9/13/18, 12:08 PM - Tim Ko: The only thing I can think of is collin getting an A plus on his senior thesis, but other than that most of our goals are very tangible
9/13/18, 12:09 PM - Alex Starr: I’m confused
9/13/18, 12:10 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t think it matters who I am or much what others think
9/13/18, 12:11 PM - Collin Hurst: ummmmmmmmm
9/13/18, 12:11 PM - Collin Hurst: A+ btw
9/13/18, 12:13 PM - Ricky: he literally put "A plus"
9/13/18, 12:14 PM - Alex Starr: He really meant a plus
9/13/18, 12:14 PM - Alex Starr: So it was positive, but we don’t know how positive
9/13/18, 12:14 PM - Collin Hurst: oh i didnt see that lol
9/13/18, 12:16 PM - Tim Ko: That’s good Alex
9/13/18, 12:17 PM - Tim Ko: U are a confident man
9/13/18, 12:17 PM - Alex Starr: Is it tho?
9/13/18, 12:17 PM - Alex Starr: Thinking what anyone thinks doesn’t matter doesn’t seem good
9/13/18, 12:18 PM - Tim Ko: Well it’s better than the other way around I’d say
9/13/18, 12:18 PM - Alex Starr: And doesn’t preclude from caring what anyone thinks
9/13/18, 12:18 PM - Alex Starr: Thinking it doesn’t matter but still caring seems like basically the worst permutation actually
9/13/18, 12:19 PM - Alex Starr: Outside of caring but thinking it doesn’t matter
9/13/18, 12:19 PM - Tim Ko: So ur saying u care about what others think
9/13/18, 12:19 PM - Tim Ko: But what they think don’t matter?
9/13/18, 12:20 PM - Alex Starr: Of course everyone does
9/13/18, 12:20 PM - Alex Starr: Yup
9/13/18, 12:20 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah for sure
9/13/18, 12:20 PM - Tim Ko: What do u mean by don’t matter
9/13/18, 12:21 PM - Alex Starr: It is of no consequence
9/13/18, 12:21 PM - Tim Ko: I see
9/13/18, 12:22 PM - Tim Ko: Well in a sense, there are some if it affects how u live ur life
9/13/18, 12:22 PM - Alex Starr: No consequence
9/13/18, 12:23 PM - Alex Starr: Made irrelevant and irreverent by ephemerality
9/13/18, 12:23 PM - Alex Starr: To make it sound pretty
9/13/18, 12:24 PM - Tim Ko: I’m sorry I don’t quite understand what that means
9/13/18, 12:25 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah it was pretty deliberately cryptic on my part
9/13/18, 12:28 PM - Alex Starr: It’s also all fairly contradictory
9/13/18, 12:48 PM - Collin Hurst: "there is an official world record for time traveling. It's held by cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev, who has spent 803 days total in orbit around Earth. According to Einstein's theories of relativity, this would mean Sergei effectively has travelled about 0.02 seconds forward in time."
9/13/18, 12:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: I think we just gotta learn to be ok with less clarity about what it is that motivates us
9/13/18, 12:50 PM - Alex Starr: I think I have clarity to a good extent it just isn’t overly informative or helpful
9/13/18, 1:04 PM - Matt Casali: Goals
9/13/18, 2:19 PM - Tim Ko: That’s bad ass
9/13/18, 2:22 PM - Parker: that’s sick haha
9/13/18, 4:05 PM - Alex Starr: Immortality is just a c away I guess
9/13/18, 4:14 PM - Parker: whatchu mean
9/13/18, 4:58 PM - Alex Starr: Have matt explain
9/13/18, 5:00 PM - Matt Casali: c = 299,792,458 m/s
9/13/18, 5:00 PM - Matt Casali: Tadaaa
9/13/18, 5:02 PM - Parker: oh i thought that was unrelated haha

10/18/18, 1:35 PM - Alex Starr: Why
10/18/18, 1:36 PM - Darren: The heading to the gym comment makes me think your back is better and you haven't updated us on how shitty your back is in a while
10/18/18, 1:36 PM - Darren: Just curious
10/18/18, 1:37 PM - Alex Starr: It’s definitely worse than a few weeks ago
10/18/18, 1:37 PM - Darren: Darn

10/18/18, 3:32 PM - Alex Starr: It is so tricky
10/18/18, 3:43 PM - Darren: The principle itself is almost insultingly easy, but applying it can be weird
10/18/18, 3:55 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah there’s one about proving that any n distinct numbers can sum to something divisible by n
10/18/18, 3:55 PM - Alex Starr: Some subset of those n numbers*
10/18/18, 3:55 PM - Alex Starr: When I saw the solution I realized given 5 hours and my life on the line, I couldn’t have done it

10/18/18, 10:41 PM - Matt Casali: I would like to meet her
10/18/18, 10:41 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah like Monday night after we hung out, she sent me this long ass deepish text about our relationship that kinda came out of no where
10/18/18, 10:42 PM - Matt Casali: That's something I do haha and I dont have a uterus
10/18/18, 10:42 PM - Tim Ko: I took it very seriously and then I suggested we sit down the next day and talk about it, when we talked about it she totally forgot what she txted me
10/18/18, 10:42 PM - Darren: Are you sure?
10/18/18, 10:42 PM - Matt Casali: Not entirely...

10/18/18, 10:49 PM - Ricky: It’s one of those things you can’t really empathize with so you gotta just be supportive
10/18/18, 10:50 PM - Ricky: For real though, I’m v happy for you Timmy
10/18/18, 10:50 PM - Darren: But let's be clear, you should be supportive regardless of whether she's on her period or not. There are so many reasons somewhat could be acting weird
10/18/18, 10:51 PM - Alex Starr: They are people too
10/18/18, 10:51 PM - Alex Starr: Don’t call them somewhat
10/18/18, 10:51 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah for sure
10/18/18, 10:51 PM - Ricky: It feels like she is a made up person cuz I can’t put any memories or anything toward her but you are dating her, it’s wild
10/18/18, 10:51 PM - Ricky: Like a fairytale
10/18/18, 10:51 PM - Darren: Oh whoops

10/28/18, 12:28 AM - Parker: idk she’s being weird
10/28/18, 9:51 AM - Tim Ko: Aw I see
10/28/18, 10:31 AM - Parker: but then again when is she not
10/28/18, 10:31 AM - Parker: the latest update from two weeks ago was she wants me to be more aggressive physically
10/28/18, 10:31 AM - Parker: but then i try
10/28/18, 10:31 AM - Parker: and she runs away or leaves
10/28/18, 10:32 AM - Parker: like at the party last night and the night before
10/28/18, 10:36 AM - Matt Casali: What
10/28/18, 10:38 AM - Parker: as in like making moves physically
10/28/18, 10:38 AM - Parker: bc we still haven’t done a lot in that regard
10/28/18, 10:38 AM - Parker: but it’s hard to make moves when she gives me nothing to work with
10/28/18, 11:01 AM - Ricky: You got it pman
10/28/18, 11:01 AM - Ricky: Honestly, she just seems like she is trying to pick at every problem
10/28/18, 11:02 AM - Ricky: And isn’t trying to face it
10/28/18, 11:02 AM - Ricky: If she says that and acts another way
10/28/18, 11:02 AM - Ricky: :(
10/28/18, 11:03 AM - Ricky: In other news, my baseball team made it to playoffs! I tied it with a headfirst dive into home
10/28/18, 11:08 AM - Jason Greenberg: Thats pretty dumb imo
10/28/18, 11:11 AM - Collin Hurst: Ganggggg
10/28/18, 11:11 AM - Collin Hurst: Should've trucked the catcher
10/28/18, 11:11 AM - Matt Casali: ^
10/28/18, 11:12 AM - Collin Hurst: Runs away? Tf?
10/28/18, 11:21 AM - Parker: i agree!!
10/28/18, 11:21 AM - Parker: i mean like she leaves places fast or whatever
10/28/18, 11:21 AM - Parker: or the last two nights she showed up for like 10 mins
10/28/18, 12:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: You should nonconfrontally call her out
10/28/18, 12:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: You should use the marriage test. If you don't think the way she treats you would go well on your wedding day then you know
10/28/18, 12:14 PM - Darren: That seems extreme
10/28/18, 12:45 PM - Parker: ^
10/28/18, 12:46 PM - Parker: i would normally just assume she’s over it but she’s bad at expressing herself so i don’t necessarily think that
10/28/18, 12:46 PM - Parker: but i am too so it’s not a good combo lol
10/28/18, 1:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah
10/28/18, 4:52 PM - Tim Ko: Damn parker I’m sorry :(
10/28/18, 4:53 PM - Tim Ko: This situation seems pretty wack man

10/29/18, 6:16 PM - Tim Ko: Thx
10/29/18, 6:17 PM - Tim Ko: What a contrast. I felt like damn Superman like last month getting 6 hours of sleep and feeling super awake and now I get 9 HRs and I’m tired by 5 pm

10/29/18, 9:58 PM - Ricky: Litera dick In a box

10/29/18, 10:00 PM - Collin Hurst: I bet that would happen a lot more often if they stayed hard once you cut them off
10/29/18, 10:00 PM - Vaughn: Plenty of time to cut a hole in a box
10/29/18, 10:03 PM - Ricky: Lmao, lit lit lit
10/29/18, 10:09 PM - Alex Starr: Even after a year

10/29/18, 10:23 PM - Alex Starr: Confidently walk in completely nude?
10/29/18, 10:23 PM - Alex Starr: I’d say that’s maximum aggression without being felonious outright
10/29/18, 10:27 PM - Tim Ko: LOL
10/29/18, 10:28 PM - Tim Ko: Then walk out
10/29/18, 10:42 PM - Alex Starr: No...
10/29/18, 10:43 PM - Alex Starr: I assumed the follow up would be a second entrance
10/29/18, 10:43 PM - Alex Starr: Tho that would likely be followed shortly by a hasty exit
10/29/18, 11:44 PM - Parker: hahaha stfu

11/1/18, 3:08 PM - Alex Starr: What’s chaos theory
11/1/18, 3:08 PM - Alex Starr: Other than a lame supervillain
11/1/18, 3:14 PM - Matt Casali: For some systems, the predicted motion based off of two initial conditions that vary a super small amount will be very different (like a driven, damped pendulum starting at 60 degrees vs. 60.00001 degrees will show super different motion)
11/1/18, 3:47 PM - Vaughn: Smash direct baby
11/1/18, 3:48 PM - Darren: Smash direct was ass

11/1/18, 4:59 PM - Vaughn: If you rank high enough youll be put in a separate elite bracket

11/2/18, 5:04 PM - Parker: it’s a lot about the mindset you have going in too
11/2/18, 11:09 PM - Tim Ko: <Media omitted>
11/2/18, 11:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: Had an awesome trip
11/2/18, 11:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: The store owner told us to stop all other drugs like alcohol weed and caffeine at least 8 hours before, eat a good meal 3 hours before, and be in an open air space to have a good trip every time
11/3/18, 12:01 AM - Jason Greenberg: Being in a nature on shrooms was very profound
11/3/18, 12:01 AM - Jason Greenberg: Its hard to put into words but nature feels way different to me now
11/3/18, 12:25 AM - Jason Greenberg: I also came to a few realizations that I hope enrich my life
11/3/18, 12:43 AM - Tim Ko: What are they
11/3/18, 12:44 AM - Parker: yeah i’ve heard that
11/3/18, 12:44 AM - Parker: it’s super hard to describe it according to maarty
11/3/18, 12:50 AM - Jason Greenberg: We could talk about it sometime if it was the right time
11/3/18, 12:51 AM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah for me i realized the immensity and complexity of it and felt our place as humans a little more within it. It mostly cranked my appreciation for it waaay up
11/3/18, 1:08 AM - Parker: that’s sick
11/3/18, 1:08 AM - Parker: i almost did them at the end of last year
11/3/18, 1:11 AM - Jason Greenberg: How do you feel about them?
11/3/18, 1:45 AM - Parker: I’m open to them
11/3/18, 1:45 AM - Parker: and have heard and read about many stories
11/3/18, 1:45 AM - Parker: idk if i’d do anything pst them
11/3/18, 1:45 AM - Parker: one of my roommates has acid but idk if i wanna do that
11/3/18, 2:02 AM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah i think carefulness is the best approach
11/3/18, 2:03 AM - Jason Greenberg: I havent done lsd so i wouldnt know but if you aren't really excited about it, it might not be the right time
11/3/18, 2:04 AM - Parker: yeah that’s why i don’t really want to
11/3/18, 2:04 AM - Parker: unless i’m all in, i’m not gonna have a good time
11/3/18, 2:04 AM - Parker: i’m more open to shrooms than lsd
11/3/18, 2:12 AM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah thats smart
11/3/18, 2:16 AM - Jason Greenberg: Def take your time thinking about it
11/3/18, 2:21 AM - Jason Greenberg: The health risks were what held me back intially, bc you can get flashbacks or permanent psychosis but i read more about people's firsthand accounts of flashbacks and it seemed like they were less like "fuck this is an uncontrollable death spiral" and more like "oh remember that cool thing i saw on my trip"
11/3/18, 2:22 AM - Jason Greenberg: Psychosis was still a possibility but it was more likely that i'd be killed in a car accident so didnt even give it a thought tbh
11/3/18, 11:00 AM - Ricky: Damn that’s so cool jason!!!
11/3/18, 11:00 AM - Ricky: Ricky had his own experience last night, called formal for 5 minutes then blackout

11/7/18, 11:46 PM - Darren: What inventory system are we using? Perpetual?

11/8/18, 2:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: The hype is real
11/8/18, 2:30 PM - Ricky: Sounds LIT
11/8/18, 2:50 PM - Alex Starr: Actually?
11/8/18, 7:56 PM - Vaughn: Question, how much were in those edibles we took in tahoe?
11/8/18, 7:58 PM - Collin Hurst: 20mg but edibles are really variable between producers/type etc
11/8/18, 8:05 PM - Parker: ^
11/8/18, 8:05 PM - Parker: dispensary edibles are pretty consistent though
11/8/18, 8:06 PM - Parker: it’s homemade when there’s huge variance
11/8/18, 8:30 PM - Alex Starr: They also (judging by matt and my experiences) hit people pretty differently
11/8/18, 8:30 PM - Alex Starr: We should edible over winter break though
11/8/18, 8:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: Edibles arent my favorite i think
11/8/18, 8:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: Down to smoke fat stacks tho
11/8/18, 8:35 PM - Alex Starr: I’m the reverse
11/8/18, 8:35 PM - Parker: ^
11/8/18, 8:35 PM - Parker: ^
11/8/18, 8:37 PM - Darren: I seem to always get the ones spiked with puke
11/8/18, 8:37 PM - Darren: Just bad luck
11/8/18, 8:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: To be fair you havent smoked a fat stack in your life
11/8/18, 8:41 PM - Parker: ^
11/8/18, 8:42 PM - Parker: i keep telling you alex
11/8/18, 8:42 PM - Vaughn: Down for all that except the puke
11/8/18, 8:44 PM - Alex Starr: No intention too
11/8/18, 8:44 PM - Parker: that’s okay
11/8/18, 8:44 PM - Parker: we are just acknowledging that’s why u prefer edibles
11/8/18, 8:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yup
11/8/18, 9:04 PM - Matt Casali: Smoking roolz, edibles drool
11/8/18, 9:13 PM - Parker: fax
11/8/18, 9:19 PM - Alex Starr: Lung cancer agrees
11/8/18, 9:46 PM - Parker: is not cigarettes foo
11/8/18, 9:48 PM - Alex Starr: Smoke is still carcinogenic
11/8/18, 10:35 PM - Parker: i’m award
11/8/18, 10:35 PM - Parker: aware
11/9/18, 2:27 AM - Jason Greenberg: Not enuff research chap
11/9/18, 2:28 AM - Jason Greenberg: Either way there's nothing wrong with a mixed night and long as each person sticks to either edibles or smoking but not both
11/9/18, 6:23 AM - Alex Starr: Sounds good to me
11/9/18, 6:24 AM - Alex Starr: So it actually is not carcinogenic at all?
11/9/18, 6:24 AM - Alex Starr: Cuz fucking toast is carcinogenic
11/9/18, 6:26 AM - Alex Starr: After further research it is carcinogenic but less than cigarettes by a large margin
11/9/18, 6:26 AM - Alex Starr: It is more carcinogenic than toast
11/9/18, 9:44 AM - Parker: ^
11/9/18, 9:54 AM - Jason Greenberg: Lol
11/9/18, 9:55 AM - Jason Greenberg: My understanding is that is should be somewhat bad but significant links to cancer have yet to be thoroughly established
11/9/18, 9:56 AM - Alex Starr: Yep
11/9/18, 9:56 AM - Alex Starr: It’s like flossing
11/9/18, 9:56 AM - Alex Starr: Sure we don’t have a study clearly linking it to dental health, but all experts pretty much agree it does
11/9/18, 10:06 AM - Alex Starr: That being said “way less cancerous than cigarettes” isn’t exactly a vote of confidence
11/9/18, 10:08 AM - Alex Starr: Cuz cigarettes are just short of chugging dimethyl sulfate in Fukushima
11/9/18, 11:37 AM - Jason Greenberg: What do that do
11/9/18, 11:37 AM - Alex Starr: Which part?
11/9/18, 11:37 AM - Jason Greenberg: Dimethyl sulfate
11/9/18, 11:37 AM - Alex Starr: Dimethyl sulfate is a chemical “mutagen” that mutates DNA so causes cancer
11/9/18, 11:39 AM - Jason Greenberg: Non bene
11/9/18, 11:40 AM - Alex Starr: Nah it’s really good for doing experiments
11/9/18, 1:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ok you win
11/9/18, 1:16 PM - Alex Starr: Not for drinking tho id imagine
11/9/18, 2:03 PM - Alex Starr: It’s so smoky here that it is kind of blotting out the sun
11/9/18, 2:05 PM - Collin Hurst: ;nice
11/9/18, 2:05 PM - Collin Hurst: nice
11/9/18, 2:10 PM - Alex Starr: Is it tho?

11/10/18, 9:19 AM - Matt Casali: On Saturday morning, Mr. Trump blamed “gross mismanagement of the forests” for the fires and seemed to threaten to withhold federal funds from the state. “There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor,” he said on Twitter, adding, “Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!”
11/10/18, 9:39 AM - Tim Ko: Lol wtf
11/10/18, 9:39 AM - Tim Ko: U know if we burned down all the forests, there wouldn’t be any forest fires anymore
11/10/18, 9:40 AM - Tim Ko: <Media omitted>

11/12/18, 12:11 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
11/12/18, 1:17 PM - Tim Ko: Sending emails out to health organizations and instead of writing “I’m interested in volunteering at organizations that provide health care to underserved communities” I almost wrote “undeserved communities” 😂
11/12/18, 1:23 PM - Darren: Hahaha
11/12/18, 2:00 PM - Parker: Lmao
11/12/18, 2:16 PM - Ricky: lmao
11/12/18, 8:51 PM - Darren: I'm sitting in 5 guys and the workers are talking about how in n out is better
11/12/18, 8:52 PM - Alex Starr: Can’t blame them for false advertising
11/12/18, 8:55 PM - Vaughn: At mvhs I thought the girls at the other highschools were waaaay more attractive
11/12/18, 8:56 PM - Darren: And tastier too
11/12/18, 8:57 PM - Vaughn: Chill bill
11/12/18, 8:59 PM - Alex Starr: No you’d serve bill warm with a nice tomato coulis and asparagus

11/13/18, 9:08 AM - Jason Greenberg: Oh wait do you mean in the given scenarios or in general?
11/13/18, 9:08 AM - Alex Starr: Why the different score?
11/13/18, 9:08 AM - Alex Starr: In the scenarios

11/13/18, 9:14 AM - Jason Greenberg: I'm confused
11/13/18, 9:14 AM - Alex Starr: There were those 4 preliminary questions
11/13/18, 9:14 AM - Alex Starr: About utilitarianism and total sum happiness and moral obligation
11/13/18, 9:15 AM - Jason Greenberg: And you said no to them?

11/13/18, 11:11 AM - Collin Hurst: Option 3 fight to the death
11/13/18, 11:12 AM - Darren: Less extreme Option 3, you could just call her Haley #2
11/13/18, 11:13 AM - Tim Ko: Lol
11/13/18, 11:13 AM - Tim Ko: And be ambiguous about it so she might think ur simultaneously dating 2 girls named Hayley
11/13/18, 11:35 AM - Jason Greenberg: Ayy way to go tim haha

11/13/18, 3:54 PM - Ricky: Oh fuck, you right
11/13/18, 3:55 PM - Ricky: We should all legally change our names to Hayley
11/13/18, 3:55 PM - Ricky: Then no matter what happens a Hayley is dating someone when we talk

11/24/18, 3:56 PM - Alex Starr: That’s all I needed to know
11/24/18, 3:56 PM - Alex Starr: Will Rohan be present?
11/24/18, 3:56 PM - Alex Starr: If so, unideal imo
11/24/18, 3:57 PM - Collin Hurst: no hes not coming
11/24/18, 3:57 PM - Collin Hurst: but when we hang after that would be cool if he could come I don't want to leave him hanging out to dry

11/24/18, 5:06 PM - Matt Casali: Wouldn't think of it
11/24/18, 5:06 PM - Darren: So, am I going straight to the restaurant or is there time for me to meet up at Alex's
11/24/18, 5:07 PM - Vaughn: We have the alex

11/24/18, 5:12 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t think so
11/24/18, 5:12 PM - Darren: Omw
11/24/18, 5:16 PM - Alex Starr: If you know what you want I can order for you
11/24/18, 5:17 PM - Alex Starr: But only if ur fast
11/25/18, 11:21 AM - Parker: back in america land
11/25/18, 11:22 AM - Collin Hurst: Gang
11/25/18, 12:57 PM - Ricky: Gaaaaaang
11/25/18, 1:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: Gang to the gang mobile
11/25/18, 2:31 PM - Darren: From playing some ultimate, the knock back speed is really weird and will take some time to get used to
11/25/18, 2:31 PM - Collin Hurst: Yoshi's dick will take some time to get used to
11/25/18, 2:35 PM - Darren: It feels like edge guarding is gonna be way more successful because airdodging off stage is a death sentence for a lot of characters
11/25/18, 2:36 PM - Vaughn: I heard the game feels way faster
11/25/18, 2:36 PM - Vaughn: Have you tried any of the big characters with landing their landing lag/faster aerials?
11/25/18, 2:45 PM - Tim Ko: Based on experience huh
11/25/18, 2:46 PM - Darren: ^
11/25/18, 2:49 PM - Darren: It does feel like aerials are more like melee
11/25/18, 2:51 PM - Darren: Ganon with a sword is badass
11/25/18, 2:53 PM - Vaughn: I must know one more thing
11/25/18, 2:53 PM - Vaughn: Did they change ness' aerials
11/25/18, 2:54 PM - Alex Starr: How long is Marths sword
11/25/18, 2:54 PM - Alex Starr: And do throws combo
11/25/18, 2:54 PM - Alex Starr: And can you dashdance
11/25/18, 2:59 PM - Collin Hurst: Is yoshie still S tier
11/25/18, 3:00 PM - Alex Starr: Collin u should be shit talking Yoshi so getting beaten badly isn’t quite so rough
11/25/18, 3:01 PM - Darren: Sameish
11/25/18, 3:01 PM - Darren: Yes
11/25/18, 3:01 PM - Darren: Eh
11/25/18, 3:02 PM - Alex Starr: Well 1/3 isn’t
11/25/18, 3:05 PM - Darren: Idk
11/25/18, 3:06 PM - Alex Starr: Overall impression?
11/25/18, 3:06 PM - Alex Starr: Faster seems like a good sign
11/25/18, 3:06 PM - Tim Ko: Is Pac-Man still op?
11/25/18, 3:08 PM - Darren: Jump speed is overall just way faster
11/25/18, 3:11 PM - Darren: You can't run through people anymore, so there's no pivot grabs
11/25/18, 3:14 PM - Alex Starr: That’s kinda lame
11/25/18, 3:15 PM - Alex Starr: Is perfect pivoting still a thing?
11/25/18, 3:19 PM - Vaughn: Whoa really?
11/25/18, 3:19 PM - Alex Starr: But u can pivot grab right?
11/25/18, 3:19 PM - Vaughn: So what happens when someone runs super fast up to an enemy
11/25/18, 3:19 PM - Vaughn: Is there like a contact delay
11/25/18, 3:20 PM - Vaughn: So captain falcon cant just sprint up and land a grab every time?
11/25/18, 3:20 PM - Alex Starr: Nah he’d still be able to run up and grab just not run through and grab
11/25/18, 3:28 PM - Darren: Nope
11/25/18, 3:29 PM - Darren: You slow down when you make contact and start pushing them
11/25/18, 3:29 PM - Alex Starr: Rar?
11/25/18, 3:29 PM - Darren: You can't run through someone laying on the ground either
11/25/18, 3:29 PM - Tim Ko: The real questions is, is Luigi’s mansion still a stage?
11/25/18, 3:30 PM - Darren: I think so
11/25/18, 3:31 PM - Darren: No jump canceling
11/25/18, 3:31 PM - Alex Starr: That was my follow up
11/25/18, 3:38 PM - Alex Starr: Most interesting character?
11/25/18, 3:39 PM - Vaughn: And how do you unlock characters?
11/25/18, 3:49 PM - Darren: You can either play world of light or characters will unlock randomly as you play multiplayer
11/25/18, 3:49 PM - Darren: World of light looks boring
11/25/18, 3:50 PM - Darren: I'm kinda biased against most of the characters in this game
11/25/18, 3:53 PM - Alex Starr: But of the non obvious ones
11/25/18, 7:12 PM - Darren: Mewtwo
11/25/18, 11:33 PM - Vaughn: Have you guys seen letterkenny?
11/25/18, 11:34 PM - Parker: HOLY SHIT
11/25/18, 11:34 PM - Vaughn: @thecanadianones

11/26/18, 1:10 PM - Vaughn: Fuck yeah
11/26/18, 1:36 PM - Darren: The new perfect shield almost feels like a counter when you get it and it changes the flow of the fight pretty drastically
11/26/18, 1:40 PM - Alex Starr: Yikes
11/26/18, 1:46 PM - Darren: That said, perfect shielding is harder to do and it feels like it could be pretty hype for final stock situations
11/26/18, 1:51 PM - Collin Hurst: is yoshi's Nair still frame -1
11/26/18, 2:33 PM - Vaughn: Perfect shielding is soooooo hype

12/12/18, 9:18 AM - Darren: Wtf
12/12/18, 9:19 AM - Vaughn: Shes a new teacher, doesnt really get how math tests should work
12/12/18, 9:21 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah they should have 6-12 questions each of which takes 15-30 minutes
12/12/18, 9:21 AM - Alex Starr: Maybe some true false
12/12/18, 9:22 AM - Matt Casali: My math test was four easy questions open book, open note
12/12/18, 9:22 AM - Matt Casali: Which I'm fine with
12/12/18, 9:22 AM - Darren: Apparently the 102 final is 4 questions, each of them worth 10% of your overall grade
12/12/18, 9:23 AM - Alex Starr: What’s that class
12/12/18, 9:23 AM - Alex Starr: Do they curve down?
12/12/18, 9:23 AM - Matt Casali: No I dont think so
12/12/18, 9:23 AM - Darren: Algorithms
12/12/18, 9:23 AM - Matt Casali: The professor is the most laid back guy I've ever met
12/12/18, 9:23 AM - Darren: And he's met heiken
12/12/18, 9:24 AM - Alex Starr: Ah okay makes sense
12/12/18, 9:24 AM - Matt Casali: Stefano Profumo, a true Italian stallion
12/12/18, 9:25 AM - Alex Starr: But still an hour? Even my bio ones take 2 and they are pretty all or nothing
12/12/18, 9:25 AM - Alex Starr: And CS is also open note open book but you’d still like a couple more hours
12/12/18, 9:26 AM - Alex Starr: Just seems like a weird policy that doesn’t actually differentiate who understood the material, just who didn’t make a silly mistake
12/12/18, 9:26 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah it's not bad at all
12/12/18, 9:26 AM - Matt Casali: Although I was one of the first ones to finish, I think it takes others maybe 2 hours?
12/12/18, 9:27 AM - Alex Starr: Any idea of grade distribution?
12/12/18, 9:27 AM - Matt Casali: No idea
12/12/18, 9:28 AM - Alex Starr: It’s weird you guys don’t have a site with that info public
12/12/18, 9:28 AM - Matt Casali: I actually may
12/12/18, 9:28 AM - Matt Casali: I'm looking it up
12/12/18, 9:29 AM - Alex Starr: We have something called Berkeleytime with historical enrollment/grades for every class since like 2008
12/12/18, 9:29 AM - Matt Casali: Well isnt Cal just soooooo great
12/12/18, 9:29 AM - Alex Starr: No it isn’t
12/12/18, 9:30 AM - Alex Starr: Cuz u find out you somehow got all the professors that only give 12% As instead of 20%
12/12/18, 9:30 AM - Alex Starr: Except in CS but that’s just brutal with a lot of As
12/12/18, 9:32 AM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
12/12/18, 9:33 AM - Alex Starr: Ah okay

12/27/18, 8:54 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah
12/27/18, 8:54 AM - Alex Starr: But I need that question answered to know when I’m free
12/27/18, 8:54 AM - Ricky: That doesn’t make sense
12/27/18, 8:55 AM - Alex Starr: Sure it does
12/27/18, 8:55 AM - Alex Starr: If we are shopping for Art Deco park benches, I’m not free
12/27/18, 8:55 AM - Ricky: That’s not true, you just don’t wanna go
12/27/18, 8:55 AM - Alex Starr: Tomato tomato
12/27/18, 8:55 AM - Ricky: Being free and wanting to go are two different things
12/27/18, 8:56 AM - Alex Starr: Not really
12/27/18, 8:56 AM - Alex Starr: Cuz there are things I could be busy with
12/27/18, 8:57 AM - Ricky: Not once have you ever followed up with what those urgent things are when you depart
12/27/18, 8:57 AM - Ricky: So I feel they different
12/27/18, 8:57 AM - Ricky: But I’m free most of the day just gotta take max to get ski pants
12/27/18, 8:58 AM - Alex Starr: Never claimed urgency merely exigency
12/27/18, 8:58 AM - Alex Starr: My point is you don’t _have_ to
12/27/18, 9:03 AM - Ricky: But my point is I tell you
12/27/18, 9:03 AM - Ricky: So it is more valid in others eyes
12/27/18, 9:04 AM - Alex Starr: Not in mine
12/27/18, 9:05 AM - Ricky: Fair enough, but your not catering to an audience of Alex’s
12/27/18, 9:08 AM - Alex Starr: I am catering to no one
12/27/18, 9:08 AM - Ricky: Haha

12/31/18, 10:46 AM - Ricky: Because I think it may be pausible for me to come but I’m curious if graces friends (Sam, Tiff, Kiana, and Natalie) could maybe come?
12/31/18, 10:46 AM - Ricky: They haven’t been asked or anything
12/31/18, 10:46 AM - Ricky: I’m just exploring all options to see what could work best
12/31/18, 10:46 AM - Matt Casali: Hmm, I'll ask my parents if that's cool
12/31/18, 10:46 AM - Matt Casali: They're just worried about a lot of people coming that they dont know
12/31/18, 10:47 AM - Matt Casali: Honestly, I'd be most comfortable with Sam and Kiana coming because I trust them more
12/31/18, 10:47 AM - Ricky: Yeah, but like Kiana and Sam are people who would be fine with a more chill thing
12/31/18, 10:47 AM - Ricky: Haha yeah exactly
12/31/18, 10:47 AM - Ricky: Grace said Nat and Tiff would prob wanna go to a bar anyways?
12/31/18, 10:48 AM - Ricky: Idk, I just wanna see. But if not of course I understand
12/31/18, 10:48 AM - Ricky: But there is no way like random people will come
12/31/18, 10:48 AM - Ricky: If anyone shows up that we don’t personally know, I’ll RKO them or something
12/31/18, 10:56 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah, my parents aren't comfortable with it
12/31/18, 10:56 AM - Matt Casali: I would have liked to have them over but oh well
12/31/18, 10:57 AM - Matt Casali: But grace is welcome
12/31/18, 10:57 AM - Ricky: Oh ok
12/31/18, 10:57 AM - Ricky: Then I probably won’t be attending
12/31/18, 10:57 AM - Ricky: Sorry
12/31/18, 10:57 AM - Matt Casali: Not even for a bit?
12/31/18, 10:58 AM - Ricky: Haha not if it starts at 9
12/31/18, 10:58 AM - Ricky: And graces friends can’t come
12/31/18, 10:58 AM - Matt Casali: Cause you'll be in sf?
12/31/18, 10:58 AM - Ricky: Most likely
12/31/18, 10:58 AM - Matt Casali: Grace's friends will be there
12/31/18, 10:58 AM - Alex Starr: Damn unfortunate on multiple accounts
12/31/18, 10:58 AM - Ricky: Most likely
12/31/18, 10:59 AM - Ricky: Unless they decide to go to melads thing or whatever
12/31/18, 10:59 AM - Alex Starr: I thought most of them were in Mexico
12/31/18, 10:59 AM - Matt Casali: I dont think you understand what I'm saying
12/31/18, 10:59 AM - Matt Casali: Grace's friends will be at my house
12/31/18, 10:59 AM - Ricky: What?
12/31/18, 10:59 AM - Matt Casali: We are her friends
12/31/18, 10:59 AM - Alex Starr: My thoughts exactly
12/31/18, 10:59 AM - Ricky: Oh
12/31/18, 11:00 AM - Ricky: Haha ok
12/31/18, 11:00 AM - Ricky: Well are her friends not ur friends then?
12/31/18, 11:00 AM - Matt Casali: What?
12/31/18, 11:00 AM - Ricky: Or I guess her friends that aren’t you
12/31/18, 11:00 AM - Matt Casali: I am confusion
12/31/18, 11:00 AM - Ricky: I’m saying Kiana Sam etc. they are not ur friends?
12/31/18, 11:00 AM - Alex Starr: Nah our friends that are her friends that aren’t us
12/31/18, 11:00 AM - Ricky: Exactly
12/31/18, 11:00 AM - Matt Casali: They are...
12/31/18, 11:01 AM - Alex Starr: Is this a mad lib?
12/31/18, 11:01 AM - Ricky: Oh then I guess her friends will be in both sf and ur house?
12/31/18, 11:01 AM - Alex Starr: We need an adjective
12/31/18, 11:01 AM - Ricky: Does that fill your specifications?
12/31/18, 11:01 AM - Alex Starr: Usually Matt is the one specifically filling things
12/31/18, 11:02 AM - Matt Casali: Ricky you're distracting from the point that you're ditching us on the last day that you'll be able to see us
12/31/18, 11:02 AM - Alex Starr: Well to be fair, he did find a workaround
12/31/18, 11:02 AM - Ricky: I am trying to do both
12/31/18, 11:02 AM - Matt Casali: I guess so
12/31/18, 11:02 AM - Jason Greenberg: Good tries all around
12/31/18, 11:02 AM - Ricky: But that’s a definite no on Sam and Kiana?
12/31/18, 11:02 AM - Alex Starr: What if they came with a lithe stealth
12/31/18, 11:03 AM - Alex Starr: The only noise a subtle sussuration
12/31/18, 11:03 AM - Ricky: What if Alex comes in Sam so they are like a two in one person
12/31/18, 11:03 AM - Ricky: No one will notice
12/31/18, 11:03 AM - Matt Casali: Apparently it's okay if they come over now
12/31/18, 11:03 AM - Jason Greenberg: Lit
12/31/18, 11:03 AM - Matt Casali: So that's a yes to Sam and kiana
12/31/18, 11:04 AM - Jason Greenberg: Your move Rick
12/31/18, 11:04 AM - Matt Casali: 30 more mins with rick!
12/31/18, 11:04 AM - Ricky: But a no to nat and tiff
12/31/18, 11:04 AM - Matt Casali: No to nat and tiff
12/31/18, 11:04 AM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
12/31/18, 11:04 AM - Matt Casali: And that's me, not my parents
12/31/18, 11:04 AM - Ricky: Well if they can come then I’d stay the whole time
12/31/18, 11:04 AM - Matt Casali: Ohhhh my god
12/31/18, 11:04 AM - Jason Greenberg: Foot in the door
12/31/18, 11:04 AM - Matt Casali: I'm not budging on that haha
12/31/18, 11:04 AM - Ricky: On what?
12/31/18, 11:05 AM - Jason Greenberg: But the doesn’t open passed that
12/31/18, 11:05 AM - Matt Casali: You got your two people, now come to my house for NYE
12/31/18, 11:05 AM - Ricky: Matt I can’t just ditch the other two ahha
12/31/18, 11:05 AM - Matt Casali: I thought tiffanie and nat were gonna go to a bar or something
12/31/18, 11:05 AM - Ricky: Why exactly can’t they come, I don’t even know if they will
12/31/18, 11:05 AM - Ricky: They prob won’t
12/31/18, 11:05 AM - Matt Casali: ^
12/31/18, 11:05 AM - Ricky: But it’s weird to say, you two come, nat tiff ya didn’t make the cut
12/31/18, 11:05 AM - Matt Casali: ^
12/31/18, 11:06 AM - Ricky: I’m not countering my earlier points
12/31/18, 11:06 AM - Ricky: I’m just sayin there is a possibility they would want to
12/31/18, 11:06 AM - Matt Casali: Just tell nat and tiff that it will be _really_ chill
12/31/18, 11:06 AM - Matt Casali: Then they def wont want to come
12/31/18, 11:06 AM - Jason Greenberg: Hahahaha
12/31/18, 11:06 AM - Matt Casali: It's fine if you cant come the whole time rick
12/31/18, 11:07 AM - Matt Casali: I'm pulling your leg
12/31/18, 11:07 AM - Matt Casali: Mostly
12/31/18, 11:07 AM - Ricky: Matt it’s not a part time thing
12/31/18, 11:07 AM - Ricky: I’m going all or nothing haha
12/31/18, 11:07 AM - Matt Casali: Whatttttt
12/31/18, 11:08 AM - Ricky: Cuz if I leave your house at 9:30 then we’ll get to sf at like 11
12/31/18, 11:08 AM - Ricky: And that is a worst of both worlds for me
12/31/18, 11:09 AM - Ricky: Which is selfish but idk what else to do
12/31/18, 11:09 AM - Vaughn: Its not selfish rick dont worry
12/31/18, 11:09 AM - Matt Casali: Okay well, I'll see ya for dinner
12/31/18, 11:09 AM - Vaughn: You do you it really doesnt matter man
12/31/18, 11:09 AM - Matt Casali: Selfish is okay too, no worries
12/31/18, 11:09 AM - Vaughn: Good morning everyone
12/31/18, 11:09 AM - Ricky: Morning

12/31/18, 11:12 AM - Alex Starr: Well it is but so is everything
12/31/18, 11:12 AM - Alex Starr: Wait so Ricky Sam kiana not coming?
12/31/18, 11:13 AM - Matt Casali: Prob not
12/31/18, 11:13 AM - Alex Starr: And Matt is banning the other two but his parents are okay with it?
12/31/18, 11:13 AM - Matt Casali: But they're welcome if the planets align so that they can come
12/31/18, 11:13 AM - Matt Casali: My parents never said they were okay with tiff and nat but I'm also not gonna ask
12/31/18, 11:13 AM - Alex Starr: So that’s a yes
12/31/18, 11:13 AM - Matt Casali: Yes
12/31/18, 11:14 AM - Jason Greenberg: I don’t think it’s fair to put all the pressure on Matt just because someone needs the stars to align to make all their plans happen
12/31/18, 11:14 AM - Alex Starr: Nothing is fair, more the merrier
12/31/18, 11:14 AM - Jason Greenberg: Reasonable
12/31/18, 11:14 AM - Ricky: I think Alex wants them to come ahah
12/31/18, 11:14 AM - Ricky: I’m fine with going to SF
12/31/18, 11:14 AM - Matt Casali: /|

12/31/18, 11:15 AM - Matt Casali: I'm only halfway to breaking down, so we're good but I appreciate it
12/31/18, 11:15 AM - Jason Greenberg: I’d like to be able to jump really high
12/31/18, 11:15 AM - Matt Casali: And I'd like to be able to jump a little higher than what jason can do
12/31/18, 11:16 AM - Matt Casali: Just so he can have something to work towards
12/31/18, 11:16 AM - Jason Greenberg: Fuck you id like to be able to absorb the powers of others
12/31/18, 11:16 AM - Matt Casali: It gets lonely at the top, man
12/31/18, 11:16 AM - Vaughn: Checkmate
12/31/18, 11:16 AM - Alex Starr: Oh sweet Matt can the please come it’ll be really fun if they do
12/31/18, 11:16 AM - Ricky: Haha chilll
12/31/18, 11:16 AM - Alex Starr: Even more fun the lots of fun itd be otherwise
12/31/18, 11:17 AM - Alex Starr: Plus we’d get to see Ricky for 45 minutes before he gets in Lucas’ bed with grace
12/31/18, 11:17 AM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha
12/31/18, 11:19 AM - Alex Starr: This is not inaccurate
12/31/18, 11:20 AM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
12/31/18, 11:20 AM - Vaughn: Is tim coming?
12/31/18, 11:21 AM - Ricky: Naw he in St. Louis
12/31/18, 11:21 AM - Vaughn: And tbf we didnt have a place to do stuff till yesterday, so i wouldnt have been surpised if a couple of us made other commitments
12/31/18, 11:22 AM - Alex Starr: But also
12/31/18, 11:22 AM - Ricky: Yeah sorry, it’s deff on me for not communicating better
12/31/18, 11:23 AM - Alex Starr: Those commitments are easily made void with a simple question
12/31/18, 11:23 AM - Alex Starr: And Ricky, when will u know if they will be going to a bar? Cuz then you could come no?
12/31/18, 11:25 AM - Ricky: Well without a plan they are just gonna default to SF which does not require a bar or anything
12/31/18, 11:25 AM - Ricky: Which requires grace and then me
12/31/18, 11:25 AM - Parker: Oooo kiana and sam should come
12/31/18, 11:25 AM - Parker: i didn’t read all of that
12/31/18, 11:25 AM - Parker: but they should come
12/31/18, 11:26 AM - Vaughn: Idk if they coukd handle all the big dick energy
12/31/18, 11:26 AM - Jason Greenberg: What what is going on in SF?
12/31/18, 11:28 AM - Ricky: Like 8:30ish prob
12/31/18, 11:28 AM - Ricky: Wanna get din?
12/31/18, 11:29 AM - Ricky: I give you back rub we pet cat
12/31/18, 11:30 AM - Jason Greenberg: ^
12/31/18, 11:30 AM - Jason Greenberg: Like what are you doing there
12/31/18, 11:30 AM - Jason Greenberg: I think we’re allowed to know
12/31/18, 11:31 AM - Alex Starr: Graces friends or family who are not our friends/family/acquaintances are hosting a gathering/party that Ricky/grace/her friends who are our friends/family/acquaintances will attend if all of them can’t go to Matt’s house
12/31/18, 11:31 AM - Jason Greenberg: Haha love it
12/31/18, 11:32 AM - Jason Greenberg: Please summarize all things forever
12/31/18, 11:32 AM - Ricky: That was actually very accurate
12/31/18, 11:32 AM - Alex Starr: Matt has gotten the okay for Ricky/grace/kiana/Sam to go to his house, but refuses to ask if tiffanie/the other one (blanking on who) can go
12/31/18, 11:32 AM - Ricky: It’s like her brothers thing
12/31/18, 11:34 AM - Alex Starr: Despite this, we are grateful that Matt is hosting and appreciate that it will be stressful for him (or so I’m told) and will do all things in our power to make as not stressful as possible especially if he were to allow ricky/grace/her friends who are our friends to go
12/31/18, 11:35 AM - Ricky: It’s okie, things happen for a reason
12/31/18, 11:36 AM - Alex Starr: Its just usually a shitty reason
12/31/18, 11:37 AM - Alex Starr: If there is a god he’s completely insane so it’s best to just laugh
12/31/18, 11:39 AM - Matt Casali: That sounds like something that would be put over a really grainy image of the joker in white text on iFunny
12/31/18, 11:39 AM - Parker: ^
12/31/18, 11:40 AM - Parker: ^
12/31/18, 11:40 AM - Parker: i’m so drunk
12/31/18, 11:40 AM - Alex Starr: Hey it’s a good strategy just awkward at funerals
12/31/18, 11:42 AM - Alex Starr: All I’m saying is we (ie Matt) should gamble that tiffanie and Natalie (I remembered) won’t show up
12/31/18, 11:43 AM - Alex Starr: I like our odds, but also understand if you don’t Matt
12/31/18, 11:43 AM - Parker: ^^
12/31/18, 11:43 AM - Matt Casali: I'm really not feeling it
12/31/18, 11:44 AM - Matt Casali: Them coming I mean
12/31/18, 11:44 AM - Alex Starr: What can we do to alleviate your concerns?
12/31/18, 11:44 AM - Matt Casali: Idk
12/31/18, 11:44 AM - Parker: what about kiana and sam
12/31/18, 11:44 AM - Matt Casali: It's more of a feeling than anything
12/31/18, 11:44 AM - Parker: I feel that matt
12/31/18, 11:44 AM - Matt Casali: It's in the messages earlier if you're not too drunk to read it haha
12/31/18, 11:44 AM - Parker: What did u say
12/31/18, 11:44 AM - Parker: sorry
12/31/18, 11:45 AM - Matt Casali: Yes but they're prob not gonna a come if tiff and nat aren't invited
12/31/18, 11:45 AM - Alex Starr: They can’t come but are allowed to come
12/31/18, 11:45 AM - Alex Starr: Cuz they won’t abandon the other two
12/31/18, 11:45 AM - Parker: Tiff and nat can come but shouldn’t
12/31/18, 11:45 AM - Parker: kiana and sam gang
12/31/18, 11:45 AM - Alex Starr: Why do you think you are feeling this Matt?
12/31/18, 11:46 AM - Ricky: R u drunk at the 9ers game?! Haha

12/31/18, 1:35 PM - Parker: That’s not what i’m saying lol
12/31/18, 1:35 PM - Parker: tf
12/31/18, 1:36 PM - Ricky: But I’m saying grace has already informed them
12/31/18, 1:36 PM - Ricky: So like, they know it’s a thing but rescinded?
12/31/18, 1:36 PM - Ricky: Idk sure you can text em
12/31/18, 1:36 PM - Matt Casali: Oh hahaha

12/31/18, 1:37 PM - Ricky: They going to Meilad’s thing together
12/31/18, 1:37 PM - Ricky: But if Matt’s cool with it I gues you could invite her
12/31/18, 1:37 PM - Parker: Ew tf
12/31/18, 1:37 PM - Parker: why would u willingly do that
12/31/18, 1:37 PM - Ricky: They friends with the junior boys
12/31/18, 1:37 PM - Matt Casali: I'm def cool with Sam and Kiana
12/31/18, 1:37 PM - Matt Casali: The junior boys lol
12/31/18, 1:37 PM - Parker: Gross
12/31/18, 1:37 PM - Matt Casali: I love how we refer to them as that
12/31/18, 1:37 PM - Parker: gang
12/31/18, 1:37 PM - Ricky: Ikr? It’s funny
12/31/18, 1:37 PM - Parker: @alex
12/31/18, 1:38 PM - Matt Casali: Dont invite them if they already declined haha
12/31/18, 1:38 PM - Ricky: It just kinda makes sense, like Even Kiana and Sam prob know junior boys better than us
12/31/18, 1:39 PM - Collin Hurst: Some of them are cool
12/31/18, 1:39 PM - Parker: ew
12/31/18, 1:39 PM - Collin Hurst: I thought SF I'm confusion

12/31/18, 1:40 PM - Ricky: My b
12/31/18, 1:41 PM - Ricky: Once again my communication is lackluster
12/31/18, 1:41 PM - Collin Hurst: Well if they're at meilads the invite sounds better
12/31/18, 1:41 PM - Collin Hurst: Idk I just want them to know they are welcome and that we think they are good people on this Earth
12/31/18, 1:42 PM - Ricky: But not the other half which is the problem haha
12/31/18, 1:42 PM - Parker: ^
12/31/18, 1:42 PM - Ricky: Grace said they wanna be together
12/31/18, 1:42 PM - Collin Hurst: We just don't know the other half
12/31/18, 1:42 PM - Ricky: Exactly
12/31/18, 1:42 PM - Ricky: Which is fine
12/31/18, 1:42 PM - Ricky: But not fine for them
12/31/18, 1:42 PM - Ricky: Like we wouldn’t be down if just jason parker and vaughn went to a diff party because they didn’t like us
12/31/18, 1:42 PM - Collin Hurst: Maybe they could stand outside and just Sam and Kiana come in
12/31/18, 1:43 PM - Collin Hurst: Hehe...
12/31/18, 1:43 PM - Collin Hurst: Is that a backhand
12/31/18, 1:43 PM - Ricky: What? No it was just a random example
12/31/18, 1:43 PM - Ricky: How is it a backhand? Haha
12/31/18, 1:43 PM - Collin Hurst: Oh ok lol
12/31/18, 1:44 PM - Collin Hurst: I thought you were referencing that one time
12/31/18, 1:44 PM - Ricky: Ohhhhh haha, well that was you matt and vaughn
12/31/18, 1:44 PM - Collin Hurst: But yeah we are chillin
12/31/18, 1:44 PM - Ricky: I forgot about that haha

12/31/18, 1:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: But I’m glad we see you
12/31/18, 1:51 PM - Collin Hurst: Ok any plans today
12/31/18, 1:51 PM - Ricky: My need to make everyone happy means I am illusive until I can find a compromise

1/20/19, 4:40 PM - Matt Casali: We'll have a vote
1/20/19, 4:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: Cuz then one will be more important and it will cause jealousy
1/20/19, 4:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: That’s just gonna divide us
1/20/19, 4:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: Survival is cool bc we’re more limited and have to stick together
1/20/19, 4:41 PM - Matt Casali: Okay I might actually be down to survival cause survival has aspects of creative but not vice versa
1/20/19, 4:41 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah much more teamwork oriented

1/20/19, 4:49 PM - Ricky: But I like the survival factor
1/20/19, 4:50 PM - Ricky: Makes what you create seem so much more amazing due to the time out in rather than just clicking on a different resource to have unlimited lol

1/22/19, 9:21 AM - Matt Casali: Also, I'm still confused about that standoff in DC situation
1/22/19, 9:22 AM - Jason Greenberg: about the shutdown? or the covington kids?

1/22/19, 9:58 AM - Parker: i know lol
1/22/19, 9:58 AM - Parker: just funny
1/22/19, 10:05 AM - Jason Greenberg: Skipped around the full video and read about it, there was a group of self-called black Israelites that were shouting at a group of MAGA kids, all the while the Indigenous Peoples March is going on. The black Israelites get pretty harsh yelling at the kids who fire back some chants. Nathan Phillips (the old dude) steps in between the two groups voluntarily in an attempt he says to diffuse tensions. The kid is standing and doesn’t really move but Phillips came up to him, not the other way around. I see it as a high stress situation with two dumbasses and one misguided but well-intentioned dude
1/22/19, 10:06 AM - Matt Casali: Okay makes sense
1/22/19, 11:20 AM - Ricky: gotcha
1/22/19, 11:20 AM - Ricky: interesting

1/22/19, 12:49 PM - Ricky: We should make like a plan for what we wanna do with our server
1/22/19, 12:50 PM - Ricky: I was thinking g we all sorta make our own homes/town thing with streets and slowly upgrade it over time with multiple things like glowstone, redpowder power stuff etc.
1/22/19, 12:55 PM - Collin Hurst: ye
1/22/19, 12:57 PM - Vaughn: Ive got a volleyball game tonight

1/24/19, 11:29 AM - Matt Casali: Stage and Character Selection: 

Player Priority goes to the player who is ranked lower

After game is played, player priority goes to the loser of the first game

Games will be played on either omega or battlefield stages

Player with priority gets to choose whether the stage is omega or battlefield style

Each player chooses a character (1st and subsequent matches)

Double-Blind Pick: Either player may ask for this. Each player writes their character choice down and then selects the character they said they would choose. The referee then enforces the prior announced character choices.

Winner of the previous match chooses their character before the loser

Stalling:

If a player is stalling (involves using actions and techniques to waste time, such as running away) then that player will automatically lose that match.

Gameplay:

Primary game setting will be “CW REG”

Pausing will be disabled in this game setting

3 stocks, 6 minutes 

If game reaches 6 minutes and ends, then the player with the most stocks wins

If stocks to each player is equal, then a tiebreaker will be held.

There will be an alternate game setting labeled “TIEBREAKER” and will automatically play a 1 stock 3 minute game. If game reaches 3 minutes and ends, then the player with the lowest damage wins.  

The player who wins the best out of 3 games, wins the match

Reporting Scores: 

All scores will be reported through braacket.com “Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (Singles) Cowell College” to which referees will be given admin accessibility

The number of games that a player wins will be reported as their “score” 

e.g. Matthew has played 3 games with Vaughn and won 2, while Vaughn has won 1. The score will be Matthew - 2, Vaughn - 1
1/24/19, 11:29 AM - Matt Casali: What are people's thoughts on these rules?
1/24/19, 11:31 AM - Alex Starr: Just google “genesis ruleset”
1/24/19, 11:31 AM - Jason Greenberg: Your stalling thing is dumb I think people will get mad if you end a match over that. I’m biased also
1/24/19, 11:31 AM - Matt Casali: Stalling is dumb
1/24/19, 11:32 AM - Jason Greenberg: It’s so subjective tho
1/24/19, 11:32 AM - Matt Casali: I think people would be more pissed if someone just stalled a match so they could win
1/24/19, 11:32 AM - Matt Casali: Throughout the smash community stalling is hated so much
1/24/19, 11:32 AM - Jason Greenberg: How do you call someone on it?
1/24/19, 11:33 AM - Matt Casali: My time limit may be too small now that I think about it
1/24/19, 11:33 AM - Matt Casali: But I'd have a ref call it if they've been running away without contact for like 30 seconds or so
1/24/19, 11:33 AM - Matt Casali: It's harder to tell in ultimate for sure
1/24/19, 11:34 AM - Jason Greenberg: As long as you aren’t the ref
1/24/19, 11:34 AM - Jason Greenberg: No one likes refs
1/24/19, 11:34 AM - Matt Casali: Some so much that they put their head on a spike
1/24/19, 11:34 AM - Jason Greenberg: Throughout the ref communicate no one likes refs
1/24/19, 11:34 AM - Jason Greenberg: community*
1/24/19, 11:35 AM - Matt Casali: I really doubt anyone is gonna stall though
1/24/19, 11:35 AM - Matt Casali: This is pretty low stakes haha
1/24/19, 11:35 AM - Matt Casali: Except for 1000 dollar cash prize
1/24/19, 11:35 AM - Jason Greenberg: Wat

1/24/19, 1:25 PM - Collin Hurst: People def stal
1/24/19, 1:32 PM - Parker: yeah stalling rule is dumb haha
1/24/19, 1:41 PM - Collin Hurst: if you have referees you should just have a general unsportsman like conduct to cover stupid shit
1/24/19, 1:44 PM - Matt Casali: Js they have stalling rules in pro tournaments
1/24/19, 1:45 PM - Collin Hurst: but even at the last seconds? cause I see that a lot at the end of games
1/24/19, 1:47 PM - Matt Casali: I'm trying to make it the least up to judgement as possible since the refs are gonna be mostly RAs that havent played that much
1/24/19, 1:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: That’s gonna go great
1/24/19, 1:50 PM - Darren: for reference, 
"Stalling
Stalling, or intentionally making the game unplayable, is banned and at the discretion of tournament staff. Stalling includes but is not limited to becoming invisible, continuing infinites past 300%, and reaching a position that your opponent can never reach you. Stalling will result in a forfeit of the game for the player that initiated the action."
1/24/19, 1:50 PM - Darren: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dmojllgyDCJgHguWrGJ1X0a4Hv_bTHLh7f-s5b_g5o0/preview

1/24/19, 1:51 PM - Collin Hurst: ok so that def of stalling is not what im thinking of
1/24/19, 1:56 PM - Ricky: lol
1/24/19, 1:56 PM - Darren: Running away is a valid but bitchy strategy
1/24/19, 1:57 PM - Collin Hurst: thing is I play too aggressive for it to ever get to that point lol
1/24/19, 1:57 PM - Darren: Other pro tournaments will have rules where you can't repeat the exact same input pattern more than x times
1/24/19, 1:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: That’s prob for people like Alex
1/24/19, 1:59 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
1/24/19, 2:02 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah not in smash ultimate
1/24/19, 2:02 PM - Alex Starr: Only in melee where the invincibility on the ledge allows u to stall and infinites exist
1/24/19, 2:06 PM - Collin Hurst: makes sense
1/24/19, 2:17 PM - Ricky: Makes dollars
1/24/19, 2:18 PM - Alex Starr: Just use genesis
1/24/19, 3:07 PM - Matt Casali: Okay no stalling rules

1/24/19, 3:10 PM - Ricky: His insta says 606
1/24/19, 3:10 PM - Ricky: So it’s aight

1/24/19, 6:49 PM - Parker: yeah 606 is soft
1/24/19, 6:52 PM - Alex Starr: The words “pussy shit” get tossed around a lot, but I feel like they are appropriate here

1/25/19, 3:31 PM - Darren: I appreciate how the white box of the book goes slightly into the dark border, giving a subtle illusion of 3d
1/25/19, 3:33 PM - Alex Starr: It makes my hand look fucking huge
1/25/19, 3:43 PM - Alex Starr: Is it memeable exclusively because it’s me or are there other factors
1/25/19, 3:44 PM - Matt Casali: It's just easy to put something up
1/25/19, 3:44 PM - Parker: No the way you’re holding it makes it memeable
1/25/19, 3:44 PM - Matt Casali: I would tag it as a wholesome meme for sure
1/25/19, 3:44 PM - Matt Casali: Even though mine kinda wasnt?
1/25/19, 3:44 PM - Parker: and the slight smile
1/25/19, 3:44 PM - Matt Casali: *meme template
1/25/19, 3:44 PM - Darren: Yeah
1/25/19, 3:44 PM - Darren: And it has potential for putting something on your screen as well
1/25/19, 3:45 PM - Parker: and the monitor if you’re feeling real ballsy
1/25/19, 4:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: Is that a new computer Alex?

2/21/19, 11:04 AM - Darren: Well, not that shocked
2/21/19, 11:04 AM - Matt Casali: The effort was mostly conducted on Uighur's, a Muslim population
2/21/19, 11:04 AM - Matt Casali: And they're putting them in "re-education camps"
2/21/19, 11:04 AM - Matt Casali: Thought that was important for you all to know

2/21/19, 12:24 PM - Matt Casali: I didnt know about it
2/21/19, 12:25 PM - Alex Starr: China has a history of doing this kind of thing
2/21/19, 12:25 PM - Alex Starr: You’ve been blinded by Tim randomly saying China number 1
2/21/19, 12:25 PM - Darren: Didn't this get reported in 2016
2/21/19, 12:26 PM - Alex Starr: That would explain why I’m not surprised
2/21/19, 12:27 PM - Matt Casali: Well
2/21/19, 12:28 PM - Matt Casali: My b haha
2/21/19, 12:37 PM - Darren: I didn't know about the whole American research aspect of it tho

2/21/19, 3:11 PM - Darren: He does 3/8 of standard monitoring procedures
2/21/19, 3:11 PM - Ricky: wait
2/21/19, 3:12 PM - Ricky: i misinterpreted this article title
2/21/19, 3:12 PM - Ricky: i imagined they were putting shit in your dna to monitor you or something
2/21/19, 3:12 PM - Ricky: not taking your dna to have it inorder to monitor you
2/21/19, 3:12 PM - Ricky: less cool but still the re-education this is wack
2/21/19, 3:14 PM - Ricky: and yeah lol, like i know when they are home or not/ what they up to when home
2/21/19, 3:15 PM - Matt Casali: I feel like that's a very different type of monitoring
2/21/19, 3:18 PM - Ricky: hah but still monitoring lol
2/21/19, 3:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Your definition of monitor is different than my definition boody
2/21/19, 3:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lol
2/21/19, 3:29 PM - Parker: i get the analogy you were going for rick
2/21/19, 3:37 PM - Matt Casali: I mean me too

2/23/19, 12:46 AM - Matt Casali: I plucked my unibrow until I realized that there was really no reason to do it
2/23/19, 12:48 AM - Matt Casali: We're all floating on a big rock around a ball of fire and I'm just laughing cause we're worrying about trimming our eyebrows and worrying that we'll look gay if we trim our eyebrows (?) And its girlish (?)

2/27/19, 6:15 PM - Matt Casali: Everyone should look into the Green New Deal
2/27/19, 6:15 PM - Matt Casali: I'm sure you've heard of it but it seems like it might be the most comprehensive piece of legislation against climate change that we may have
2/27/19, 6:16 PM - Matt Casali: https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/109/text
2/27/19, 6:16 PM - Alex Starr: By may you mean won’t
2/27/19, 6:16 PM - Alex Starr: Plus I’m not so sure it’ll be all that effective
2/27/19, 6:16 PM - Matt Casali: Better than nothing
2/27/19, 6:17 PM - Alex Starr: But we are getting nothing so we better get used to it
2/27/19, 6:17 PM - Alex Starr: Thankfully I like deserts
2/27/19, 6:18 PM - Matt Casali: That may be the worst attitude ever haha
2/27/19, 6:20 PM - Alex Starr: Being optimistic’s worthless if it means ignoring the suffering of this world
2/27/19, 6:27 PM - Darren: Hope in reality
2/27/19, 6:29 PM - Tim Ko: Would u guys say climate change is the overarching problem of not being able to get clean water for everyone in the world?
2/27/19, 6:31 PM - Alex Starr: What
2/27/19, 6:32 PM - Matt Casali: I'd say it's a large factor
2/27/19, 6:32 PM - Matt Casali: And so does the Green New Deal
2/27/19, 6:32 PM - Alex Starr: I’m so confused
2/27/19, 6:32 PM - Alex Starr: How does climate change have to do with clean water?
2/27/19, 6:32 PM - Tim Ko: ^that was also part of the question
2/27/19, 6:33 PM - Tim Ko: Like is it a factor?
2/27/19, 6:33 PM - Alex Starr: No
2/27/19, 6:33 PM - Tim Ko: I see
2/27/19, 6:33 PM - Alex Starr: Not much of one
2/27/19, 6:33 PM - Matt Casali: I thought it was a factor in people's access to water
2/27/19, 6:33 PM - Alex Starr: Yes it is
2/27/19, 6:34 PM - Alex Starr: But people’s access to water isn’t a factor in climate change
2/27/19, 6:34 PM - Matt Casali: What
2/27/19, 6:35 PM - Tim Ko: So climate change is a factor in people’s access to water
2/27/19, 6:35 PM - Alex Starr: Inability to access water is a possible effect of climate change, it is in no way causal
2/27/19, 6:35 PM - Tim Ko: I was just curious
2/27/19, 6:35 PM - Alex Starr: Right I’m still confused about the question
2/27/19, 6:36 PM - Alex Starr: Are u asking:
A) is lack of access to clean water a cause of climate change
Or 
B) could some people lose access to clean water as a result of climate change
2/27/19, 6:37 PM - Tim Ko: Basically just asking if climate change was a big factor in the fact that many ppl in the world don’t have access to water
2/27/19, 6:37 PM - Tim Ko: Clean water
2/27/19, 6:37 PM - Alex Starr: Currently no
2/27/19, 6:37 PM - Tim Ko: I see
2/27/19, 6:37 PM - Alex Starr: But it could cause weather patterns to shift then
2/27/19, 6:38 PM - Tim Ko: I can imagine it could be in the future
2/27/19, 6:38 PM - Alex Starr: Yes
2/27/19, 6:38 PM - Alex Starr: But the much larger problem is too much water
2/27/19, 7:33 PM - Alex Starr: @16507995462 there didn’t seem to be a lot of specifics in there
2/27/19, 7:35 PM - Alex Starr: Seemed to basically say “let’s solve, like, all the problems.  That’d be, like, amazing right?”

3/12/19, 9:24 PM - Matt Casali: Tied for 2nd with Black Panther maybe a little bit worse
3/12/19, 9:25 PM - Matt Casali: Thor Ragnarok coming out on top oc
3/12/19, 9:25 PM - Alex Starr: I’ve heard it’s extremely average
3/12/19, 9:26 PM - Alex Starr: What the good fuck
3/12/19, 9:26 PM - Darren: Better than gotg 2, civil war, Dr strange, and Spiderman homecoming?
3/12/19, 9:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha
3/12/19, 9:26 PM - Alex Starr: Your opinion on marvel films no longer has meaning to me Matt
3/12/19, 9:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha
3/12/19, 9:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: What’s your ranking Alex?
3/12/19, 9:26 PM - Darren: Ragnarok is fantastic
3/12/19, 9:27 PM - Alex Starr: Idk what the phase 3 films are
3/12/19, 9:27 PM - Alex Starr: But ragnarok is damn near the bottom
3/12/19, 9:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: Darren?
3/12/19, 9:27 PM - Darren: Everything civil war on
3/12/19, 9:27 PM - Alex Starr: So not winter soldier?
3/12/19, 9:27 PM - Alex Starr: It’s my number 1
3/12/19, 9:27 PM - Alex Starr: Can I get a list?
3/12/19, 9:29 PM - Darren: According to the marvel wiki, phase 3 includes:
Civil War,
Dr Strange,
GotG 2,
Spiderman Homecoming,
Thor Ragnarok,
Black panther,
Infinity war
Ant-Man and the wasp,
Captain marvel,
And eventually Endgame
3/12/19, 9:31 PM - Darren: My list:
1) infinity war
2) civil War
3) Thor Ragnarok
4) Spiderman
5) GotG 2
6) black panther
7) Dr strange
8) ant man
3/12/19, 9:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ragnarok was very entertaining and different than typical marvel movies up until that point, but better than infinity war? Or civil war? Or Dr. Strange?
3/12/19, 9:32 PM - Alex Starr: 1. Infinity war 2. Black Panther 3. Civil War 4. Homecoming 5. Antman 6-8 ragnarok gotg2 strange
3/12/19, 9:32 PM - Alex Starr: Racist
3/12/19, 9:34 PM - Alex Starr: And if I had to rank 6-8, I guess 6. strange 7. ragnarok 8. gotg2
3/12/19, 9:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: Mine:
1) infinity
2) civil
3) gotg 2
4) dr strange
5) ragnorak
6) black panther
7) spidey
8) ant man
3/12/19, 9:34 PM - Alex Starr: But at that point you may as well watch Wonder Woman
3/12/19, 9:35 PM - Alex Starr: Okay why black panther so low?
3/12/19, 9:35 PM - Darren: Black panther is like wonder woman
3/12/19, 9:36 PM - Darren: It was a fantastic 2/3 of a movie with a final 1/3 that just shit the bed
3/12/19, 9:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: I mean they were all great except ant man so it was really an issue of personal connection to the film
3/12/19, 9:36 PM - Alex Starr: I disagree
3/12/19, 9:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: Which relative to the others I connected less
3/12/19, 9:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: But still it was very good
3/12/19, 9:36 PM - Darren: Albeit, with a badass final quote by killmonger
3/12/19, 9:37 PM - Alex Starr: I really liked how the bad guy kinda won in black panther
3/12/19, 9:37 PM - Alex Starr: Plus it wasn’t a tchalla fucking ascends and is unstoppable ending, felt like it could’ve gone either way
3/12/19, 9:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: That’s fine
3/12/19, 9:38 PM - Alex Starr: I’ll concede that the rhinos were really odd
3/12/19, 9:38 PM - Darren: Agreed, tho Ant-Man was a ton of fun as well
3/12/19, 9:38 PM - Alex Starr: Definitely more fun than ragnarok
3/12/19, 9:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: Disagree
3/12/19, 9:39 PM - Darren: And would have been useful in infinity war
3/12/19, 9:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ragnarok was the funniest which made it very fun
3/12/19, 9:39 PM - Darren: Funny. Everything you just said is wrong
3/12/19, 9:39 PM - Alex Starr: Honestly I found it to be roughly the least funny
3/12/19, 9:40 PM - Alex Starr: It felt very ridiculous
3/12/19, 9:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: It was very nontraditional
3/12/19, 9:40 PM - Alex Starr: It would’ve been 5 years ago, but post guardians it felt pretty run of the mill
3/12/19, 9:41 PM - Ricky: I liked I infinity war the best then everything ties but I wasn’t so about ragnarok or dr. Strange
3/12/19, 9:41 PM - Ricky: Maybe cuz those two I didn’t see in theatre
3/12/19, 9:41 PM - Alex Starr: Atta boy
3/12/19, 9:41 PM - Matt Casali: Well infinity war shouldnt count
3/12/19, 9:41 PM - Darren: Ragnarok went too far sometimes, but the majority of the jokes / improv either landed or was fun to watch
3/12/19, 9:41 PM - Ricky: Ragnarok felt like a short not a real movie haha
3/12/19, 9:43 PM - Ricky: Agreed but felt like it was kinda like a joke movie the whole time
3/12/19, 9:43 PM - Ricky: And I watched that last before infinity war so very diff Hahahah
3/12/19, 9:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: Guardians was still about solving real problems. Ragnarok was set up as more liminal and they put more force behind jokes bc the liminality made space for them to be more important. Which was different. Guardians makes jokes in stride
3/12/19, 9:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: Exactly
3/12/19, 9:44 PM - Matt Casali: Im just gonna say it
3/12/19, 9:44 PM - Matt Casali: Guardians of the Galaxy are probably my least favorite movies
3/12/19, 9:45 PM - Tim Ko: Number 2 was pretty good
3/12/19, 9:45 PM - Darren: wow, that is a puffin
3/12/19, 9:46 PM - Tim Ko: Not gonna lie, had misty eyes during the blue guys funeral
3/12/19, 9:46 PM - Ricky: Black panther was sick cuz of Michael B. Jordan and Oakland

3/12/19, 9:46 PM - Matt Casali: Andy Serkis
3/12/19, 9:47 PM - Darren: yondu and rocket was fantastic, tho taser face scene worked really hard to ruin that good will
3/12/19, 9:51 PM - Alex Starr: And I trust you again Matt.  I’m not sure how you can reconcile that with a love of ragnarok but
3/12/19, 9:52 PM - Parker: no bc i’m pretty sure it’s the only one i’ve seen of those lmao
3/12/19, 9:52 PM - Alex Starr: Alright what’s the best single scene in a marvel movie

3/12/19, 9:53 PM - Alex Starr: Shoulda aimed for the head
3/12/19, 9:54 PM - Alex Starr: Absolutely none of ragnarok
3/12/19, 9:54 PM - Darren: The immagrant song part of ragnarok
3/12/19, 9:55 PM - Darren: the emotional yondu scenes
3/12/19, 9:55 PM - Ricky: I’m always angry
3/12/19, 9:56 PM - Alex Starr: Honorable mention the hallway scene from rogue one
3/12/19, 9:56 PM - Darren: honorable mention to quicksilver in days of future past, or magneto killing nazis in first class
3/12/19, 9:57 PM - Alex Starr: How’d we miss cap vs iron man?
3/12/19, 9:57 PM - Ricky: World Series went to see about a girl scene from good will hunting
3/12/19, 9:57 PM - Alex Starr: The fuck

3/12/19, 9:58 PM - Darren: vision lifts the hammer (but just that part of the scene)
3/12/19, 9:58 PM - Ricky: I just really care what he thinks okay?!

3/12/19, 10:00 PM - Tim Ko: That’s my favorite movie
3/12/19, 10:00 PM - Darren: I also really liked the beginning of winter soldier when cap storms the boat
3/12/19, 10:01 PM - Alex Starr: Really?
3/12/19, 10:01 PM - Alex Starr: Why,
3/12/19, 10:01 PM - Alex Starr: True
3/12/19, 10:02 PM - Darren: oh, hulkbuster vs hulk was cool
3/12/19, 10:02 PM - Matt Casali: I liked this

3/12/19, 10:03 PM - Alex Starr: Hands down the worst super hero movie I’ve seen
3/12/19, 10:03 PM - Ricky: Idk, just don’t like winter soldier all that much, felt like a kinda lazy concept
3/12/19, 10:04 PM - Alex Starr: Absolutely worth pirating purely to make all other movies look good
3/12/19, 10:04 PM - Alex Starr: Tbh I was too caught up in the movie part to care
3/12/19, 10:05 PM - Darren: the death lasers wasn't as strong of an ending as it could have been
3/12/19, 10:05 PM - Matt Casali: What?
3/12/19, 10:05 PM - Ricky: Gotcha, I just feel like “oooohhh bad guy, and guess what, he happens to be ur bestfriend from long ago who also got to lose aging”
3/12/19, 10:05 PM - Darren: oh yeah, fuck bucky
3/12/19, 10:06 PM - Matt Casali: Fuckin bucktooth asshat
3/12/19, 10:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: Fuck
3/12/19, 10:06 PM - Ricky: Hahahaha was waiting for that
3/12/19, 10:08 PM - Alex Starr: See told you he’d do it anyway
3/12/19, 10:08 PM - Alex Starr: Eh
3/12/19, 10:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: Into the spiderverse where miles holds Peter up by his shirt
3/12/19, 10:09 PM - Darren: Into the Spiderverse when they show the Spiderman PS4 suit in the hall of spiders

3/12/19, 10:13 PM - Vaughn: Lemme see
3/12/19, 10:13 PM - Alex Starr: But with antman and strange pretty much swapped
3/12/19, 10:13 PM - Alex Starr: It’s up

3/12/19, 10:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Cute

3/12/19, 10:32 PM - Darren: I still can't fully get over that Mile's father is Jefferson Davis
3/12/19, 10:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: Who’s that
3/12/19, 10:32 PM - Darren: The president of the confederacy
3/12/19, 10:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: Why do you think that was his name?
3/12/19, 10:33 PM - Alex Starr: Hahaha
3/12/19, 10:47 PM - Darren: idk. But they were more comfortable naming an inner city Black cop Jefferson Davis than they were naming his son Miles Davis
3/12/19, 10:56 PM - Vaughn: Oh darren we played in the semis for futsal against your housemate
3/12/19, 10:56 PM - Vaughn: The white one who beat us at bp

3/14/19, 2:57 PM - Matt Casali: After taking so many trips to Mexico
3/14/19, 2:59 PM - Matt Casali: Walking by Graham built up a lot of nostalgia
3/14/19, 3:02 PM - Collin Hurst: what you just made the least sense possible
3/14/19, 3:04 PM - Darren: He took the seed money, turned it into series A, B, and so on until it turned into an exit and became fuck you money
3/14/19, 3:04 PM - Tim Ko: Babak could have a drug cartel in Mexico
3/14/19, 3:04 PM - Matt Casali: Thank you, Tim
3/14/19, 3:04 PM - Matt Casali: You get me
3/14/19, 3:04 PM - Darren: Babak is actually El Chapo

3/18/19, 11:14 AM - Darren: It just gets worse as the movie continues
3/18/19, 11:17 AM - Jason Greenberg: Eh I liked it for the social dynamics and brutality
3/18/19, 11:17 AM - Jason Greenberg: But that’s a lot of his movies
3/18/19, 11:20 AM - Darren: I wish the original script didn't get leaked
3/18/19, 11:21 AM - Darren: I'm just not a fan of the final plot twist
3/18/19, 11:48 AM - Parker: it was so slow
3/18/19, 11:48 AM - Parker: and painful
3/18/19, 12:31 PM - Parker: would anyone whose in town from friday to next tuesday be down to house sit for us while we’re gone?
3/18/19, 12:34 PM - Alex Starr: What’s that entail?

3/18/19, 12:35 PM - Parker: feeding and walking your
3/18/19, 12:35 PM - Parker: otie *

3/18/19, 12:46 PM - Parker: Ok! but don’t u only have one week off?
3/18/19, 12:46 PM - Parker: like it’d go into next week
3/18/19, 12:47 PM - Jason Greenberg: No thank you but thank you
3/18/19, 1:02 PM - Ricky: Yeah but I’m saying if I paired with someone who won’t return till Saturday
3/18/19, 1:02 PM - Ricky: Idk nvm haha I’m dumb
3/18/19, 2:39 PM - Parker: Ohhhh i gotcha
3/18/19, 2:40 PM - Parker: that could work
3/18/19, 2:40 PM - Parker: but it doesn’t seem like anyone is too thrilled about doing it lmao
3/19/19, 5:58 PM - Parker: <Media omitted>
3/19/19, 5:59 PM - Collin Hurst: tf hahaha
3/19/19, 6:00 PM - Darren: Is that implying that the rockets are second place, or are they only showing relevant data points?
3/19/19, 6:00 PM - Parker: No like the rockets are second lol
3/19/19, 6:01 PM - Darren: Damn
3/19/19, 6:42 PM - Tim Ko: Holy shit lmao
3/19/19, 7:08 PM - Alex Starr: Are the spurs an expansion team?
3/19/19, 7:08 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz I know that’s why the rockets are so far up there
3/19/19, 7:09 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah they came into the league 21 years late but still insane
3/19/19, 7:09 PM - Parker: The rockets are but that stat is since 97-98
3/19/19, 7:10 PM - Parker: all those teams have been in those cities atleast that long
3/19/19, 7:10 PM - Parker: Bc duncan got drafted in 98 i think or sometime around then
3/19/19, 7:10 PM - Parker: 97
3/19/19, 7:20 PM - Alex Starr: Ya spurs is since 1973
3/19/19, 7:20 PM - Alex Starr: Which is kinda recent but not nearly recent enough to explain that huge a gap
3/19/19, 7:49 PM - Parker: yeah and even if they were a more recent expansion team that stat would be even more impressive
3/19/19, 7:50 PM - Parker: bc historically expansion teams don’t do well their first few years in the league
3/19/19, 7:50 PM - Alex Starr: Well no the rockets suck ass
3/19/19, 7:50 PM - Alex Starr: Right but when it’s 55 years of difference...
3/19/19, 7:51 PM - Parker: wait what
3/19/19, 7:52 PM - Parker: 65 to 1007 is not even close to that
3/19/19, 7:52 PM - Alex Starr: The rockets have been in the league for 55 fewer years than a non-expansion team
3/19/19, 7:53 PM - Alex Starr: Even if they lost every game for the first 10 years, that would not be enough to offset
3/19/19, 7:58 PM - Parker: I don’t get what you’re saying haha
3/19/19, 7:58 PM - Alex Starr: Okay let’s say my team joined the league this year
3/19/19, 7:58 PM - Alex Starr: Automatically, we are number 1 on that list
3/19/19, 7:59 PM - Alex Starr: So a team from 20 years ago had way less time in which they could have a losing record than a team from 70 years ago
3/19/19, 8:00 PM - Alex Starr: That team from 70 years ago could’ve had a losing record for 21 years total and the new twenty year old team could’ve lost every game, but the new team would be higher ranked than the old team
3/19/19, 8:04 PM - Parker: Ohh ok i get it
3/19/19, 8:05 PM - Parker: but is that relevant? bc the stat is from 97-98 and all those teams had already been fairly established by that point
3/19/19, 8:05 PM - Alex Starr: I did not read that
3/19/19, 8:05 PM - Alex Starr: Got cutoff on my screen haha
3/19/19, 8:05 PM - Parker: Ohh yeah sorry that’s what i was trying to say earlier lol
3/19/19, 8:06 PM - Alex Starr: Makes the stat less impressive than for the spurs and much more impressive for the rockets
3/19/19, 8:08 PM - Parker: how
3/19/19, 8:08 PM - Alex Starr: I mean if the spurs had done that since 1967, that’d be insane
3/19/19, 8:09 PM - Parker: It’s still pretty crazy imo
3/19/19, 8:09 PM - Parker: atleast the gap is
3/19/19, 8:09 PM - Alex Starr: Oh it’s absolutely nuts
3/19/19, 8:10 PM - Parker: and especially most of not all of those years for the spurs include the playoffs
3/19/19, 8:10 PM - Darren: It feels like other teams need to step the fuck up
3/19/19, 8:10 PM - Parker: granted idk if that stat included playoffs or not
3/19/19, 8:10 PM - Alex Starr: No way
3/19/19, 8:11 PM - Parker: I mean if it did though, it wouldn’t really count for anything bc as soon as they lost a series their season is over and the streak stops
3/19/19, 8:11 PM - Parker: moral of the story the spurs are cray
3/19/19, 8:12 PM - Alex Starr: Right but say they lose the finals 4-3 and are losing the whole time, that’s a lot of days
3/19/19, 8:14 PM - Darren: Days as in game days or day days?
3/19/19, 8:24 PM - Parker: day days
3/19/19, 8:25 PM - Parker: yeah but the series could also flip flop
3/19/19, 8:25 PM - Parker: with only 1-2 days in between each game it wouldn’t add up to that much
3/19/19, 8:25 PM - Alex Starr: I’d bet more than 65
3/19/19, 8:25 PM - Parker: and the spurs in the 2000s weren’t losing many playoff series haha
3/19/19, 8:25 PM - Alex Starr: True
3/19/19, 8:26 PM - Parker: and if they lost 4-3, they technically could not have a losing record all series until game 7
3/20/19, 12:35 AM - Tim Ko: T- 2 HOURS!!!!
3/20/19, 12:35 AM - Tim Ko: GANG GANG GANGGGGGGGGGG
3/20/19, 12:35 AM - Tim Ko: I would stay up

3/22/19, 10:23 AM - Ricky: hahah
3/22/19, 10:44 AM - Matt Casali: I was gonna say, everytime he says that, I read it in that voice
3/22/19, 11:11 AM - Collin Hurst: Ok top of all the finals bs, the dining hall was closed this morning cause of asbestos
3/22/19, 11:12 AM - Ricky: hahaha
3/22/19, 11:12 AM - Ricky: oh no
3/22/19, 11:12 AM - Ricky: that actually sucks
3/22/19, 11:12 AM - Collin Hurst: Coffee would have been nice considering it was the first time in a few months that I woke up before 8:30
3/22/19, 11:27 AM - Ricky: lol
3/22/19, 11:27 AM - Ricky: that sounds like a 50/50 blame game
3/22/19, 11:32 AM - Parker: get starbucks
3/22/19, 11:50 AM - Darren: Starbucks involves driving a mile or two off campus, which is technically possible for Collin since he has a car
3/22/19, 11:50 AM - Darren: But if matt or Vaughn wanted Starbucks, it would have been an Odyssey to get it
3/22/19, 11:51 AM - Parker: also idk that campus at all but i doubt the dining hall is the only place to get coffee? lol
3/22/19, 11:51 AM - Vaughn: Yeah im glad im not dependent on coffee in the morning cause that woulda been booty
3/22/19, 11:52 AM - Darren: Correct, but it's certainly the most convenient when you're probably still studying in the morning and have limited time
3/22/19, 11:52 AM - Vaughn: Nothing was open on campus till 9 which was when the final started
3/22/19, 11:52 AM - Vaughn: So i had rits and salami for breakfast woot
3/22/19, 11:54 AM - Matt Casali: Breakfast of champions

3/23/19, 2:40 PM - Alex Starr: You guys wanna do sushi Thursday for dinner?
3/23/19, 2:41 PM - Alex Starr: It is my firm stance that without somewhat concrete plans we either won’t do shit or everyone will be late
3/23/19, 2:41 PM - Ricky: Even with concrete plans...
3/23/19, 2:41 PM - Ricky: Haha
3/23/19, 2:42 PM - Alex Starr: Right even with them, everyone will be late but less late
3/23/19, 2:42 PM - Alex Starr: Even with divine intervention, there’s no way everyone involved would be on time
3/23/19, 2:56 PM - Alex Starr: There are 3 Los pericos I think

3/23/19, 7:40 PM - Tim Ko: You’ll be back home by 12
3/23/19, 7:47 PM - Collin Hurst: I wonder what the odds are that nothing happens tn
3/23/19, 7:48 PM - Alex Starr: Pretty low I bet
3/23/19, 7:48 PM - Alex Starr: Matt and Vaughn aren’t that flaky
3/23/19, 7:50 PM - Alex Starr: It wasn’t my strongest excuse
3/23/19, 7:54 PM - Ricky: I am relatively flaky, but I am noncommittal this evening
3/23/19, 7:54 PM - Ricky: Imma be with grace
3/23/19, 7:55 PM - Ricky: But if y’all do a non pool activity I may make an appearance with her?
3/23/19, 8:12 PM - Matt Casali: Why no pool with grace?
3/23/19, 8:16 PM - Tim Ko: Same odds as you hooking up with someone who recently broke up with their ex
3/23/19, 8:16 PM - Tim Ko: Pretty damn high
3/23/19, 8:17 PM - Collin Hurst: 2/5
3/23/19, 8:18 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah lotta options there
3/23/19, 9:01 PM - Matt Casali: I'm gonna go to downtown Sunnyvale for dessert with my fam
3/23/19, 9:01 PM - Matt Casali: I may stay there long enough so that I can just meet you guys at the billiards place
3/23/19, 9:19 PM - Tim Ko: Ok
3/23/19, 9:22 PM - Ricky: Sry fam, pool ain’t exactly a last night kinda activity, plus grace has no idea how to play
3/23/19, 9:22 PM - Ricky: Glad I got to see y’all last night doe
3/23/19, 9:22 PM - Ricky: ❤
3/23/19, 9:26 PM - Matt Casali: Well I mean I would like to see you
3/23/19, 9:27 PM - Matt Casali: Would you wanna try to do something with us or would ya rather just have your last night with grace?
3/23/19, 9:35 PM - Parker: Lmao
3/23/19, 9:38 PM - Matt Casali: If you're counting karissa in that, remember that she just came out of a relationship with Matt Martin
3/23/19, 9:40 PM - Alex Starr: I definitely thought he was rating Tim’s joke
3/23/19, 9:40 PM - Alex Starr: 2/5 seemed apt
3/23/19, 9:47 PM - Collin Hurst: I was counting Elise lol
3/23/19, 9:48 PM - Parker: i couldn’t confirm that number but assumed it was accurate and thought it was funny haha
3/23/19, 9:48 PM - Parker: wait karissa dated matt martin??
3/23/19, 9:48 PM - Matt Casali: They had a fling for sure
3/23/19, 9:49 PM - Collin Hurst: Well the time when I was first interested in her was a long time from when we actually hooked up lol
3/23/19, 9:52 PM - Tim Ko: Vaughn u wanna carpool
3/23/19, 9:52 PM - Vaughn: Ye where we goin?
3/23/19, 9:53 PM - Alex Starr: I guess in baseball terminology, Collin has a high batting average with runners on base
3/23/19, 9:53 PM - Vaughn: Hmmm
3/23/19, 9:54 PM - Vaughn: Wouldnt it be runners just tagged out?
3/23/19, 9:54 PM - Vaughn: Maybe high percentage after runner caught stealing?
3/23/19, 9:54 PM - Tim Ko: Pool place?
3/23/19, 9:55 PM - Matt Casali: Vaughn wants to find a 4th
3/23/19, 9:55 PM - Tim Ko: I see
3/23/19, 9:55 PM - Matt Casali: But doesnt seem like anyone else is on board
3/23/19, 9:55 PM - Vaughn: Yeah we need 1 more person
3/23/19, 9:55 PM - Tim Ko: Well we can force Alex to go
3/23/19, 9:55 PM - Vaughn: True

3/23/19, 10:46 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t think I’ve ever eaten successful homemade curry
3/23/19, 10:46 PM - Matt Casali: Its hard haha
3/23/19, 10:47 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah I definitely applaud the ambition and hope it turns out
3/23/19, 10:47 PM - Alex Starr: I’m cooking Thursday for family and haven’t decided what to make
3/23/19, 10:53 PM - Matt Casali: Do chicken tikka masala
3/23/19, 10:53 PM - Matt Casali: We'll all just try to perfect our respective curries
3/23/19, 10:55 PM - Alex Starr: I’ve made that one before actually
3/23/19, 10:56 PM - Alex Starr: It was okay, but not nearly as good as from an Indian restaurant
3/23/19, 10:57 PM - Vaughn: Yo what if we had a cook off
3/23/19, 10:57 PM - Vaughn: Something simple like salsa
3/23/19, 10:57 PM - Vaughn: Everyone gets the ingredients and we vote for the best salsa
3/23/19, 10:57 PM - Matt Casali: I would love to, but for something better than salsa
3/23/19, 10:58 PM - Vaughn: Chili
3/23/19, 11:00 PM - Matt Casali: That I could get behind
3/23/19, 11:01 PM - Matt Casali: Except I'm at a disadvantage
3/23/19, 11:04 PM - Alex Starr: We could also split into teams or something
3/23/19, 11:04 PM - Alex Starr: There are companies that run iron chef sort of things
3/23/19, 11:47 PM - Tim Ko: Guys let’s go biking

3/23/19, 11:50 PM - Collin Hurst: how does it usually fo that
3/23/19, 11:51 PM - Tim Ko: My bike at Berkeley I think I put the seat high and the shape of the seat was affecting my urethra
3/23/19, 11:51 PM - Tim Ko: Which was screwing with my peeing
3/23/19, 11:51 PM - Collin Hurst: but how
3/23/19, 11:52 PM - Tim Ko: I think my seat was skinny so most of pressure was between my leg
3/23/19, 11:52 PM - Parker: wtf tim
3/23/19, 11:53 PM - Tim Ko: Guys I mentioned this lol
3/23/19, 11:53 PM - Parker: it didn’t get any less weird the second time u said it
3/23/19, 11:53 PM - Parker: i know u did
3/23/19, 11:53 PM - Collin Hurst: but how does pressure between your leg go to the urethra
3/23/19, 11:53 PM - Parker: ^
3/23/19, 11:53 PM - Parker: if anything it’s just your balls
3/23/19, 11:54 PM - Parker: but most seats do that to a certain degree
3/23/19, 11:54 PM - Tim Ko: If u go like 3 inches up ur butthole, u will feel it
3/23/19, 11:55 PM - Parker: okay you lost me
3/23/19, 11:55 PM - Tim Ko: Like 3 inches towards ur balls
3/23/19, 11:55 PM - Tim Ko: From ur butthole
3/23/19, 11:56 PM - Tim Ko: Touch it, then flex ur muscle as if u were cutting ur stream
3/23/19, 11:56 PM - Tim Ko: U will feel a tube move
3/23/19, 11:56 PM - Parker: like your taint?

3/24/19, 4:51 PM - Matt Casali: I'd rather not play secret Hitler though
3/24/19, 4:53 PM - Alex Starr: Why
3/24/19, 4:53 PM - Alex Starr: Offensive or boring
3/24/19, 4:56 PM - Matt Casali: Stressful
3/24/19, 4:57 PM - Matt Casali: I dont need that in my life haha
3/24/19, 4:57 PM - Darren: Not the answer Alex was expecting
3/24/19, 4:57 PM - Collin Hurst: How is secret Hitler more stressful than like Mario kart or something
3/24/19, 5:00 PM - Matt Casali: We were literally yelling at each other last time
3/24/19, 5:00 PM - Matt Casali: I get that enough
3/24/19, 5:05 PM - Vaughn: You have enough yelling in your life?
3/24/19, 5:06 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah
3/24/19, 5:06 PM - Matt Casali: All I'm saying is that I get stressed playing and I'd rather not play it tonight if we can do something else
3/24/19, 5:17 PM - Vaughn: In other news, i just attempted to run from my dads house to my moms
3/24/19, 5:17 PM - Vaughn: Made it halfway, felt pretty good, stopped at a pizza my heart to poop
3/24/19, 5:17 PM - Vaughn: The second i stood up I couldnt walk
3/24/19, 5:18 PM - Vaughn: My dad ended up taking me the rest of the way and im currently crawling around the house, about to take a shower on my knees
3/24/19, 5:19 PM - Darren: Rookie mistake
3/24/19, 5:19 PM - Darren: How far of a run is that?
3/24/19, 5:20 PM - Vaughn: 18 total
3/24/19, 5:20 PM - Vaughn: Made it 9
3/24/19, 5:21 PM - Vaughn: Better luck next time
3/24/19, 5:24 PM - Collin Hurst: Damn stopping was a rookie move
3/24/19, 5:24 PM - Collin Hurst: Probably didn't even stretch before you sat huh
3/24/19, 5:30 PM - Matt Casali: Gotta train for the run to Santa Cruz
3/24/19, 5:36 PM - Vaughn: Chiiiill i stretched throughout
3/24/19, 5:36 PM - Vaughn: But the fact that I cant put much weight on my right foot means either i had poor form or its time for new shoes
3/24/19, 6:32 PM - Tim Ko: Lol that’s cuz u were hitler every time last time
3/24/19, 6:32 PM - Tim Ko: Oh shit dude that’s legit
3/24/19, 6:33 PM - Parker: yeah that’s hard to do without training lmao
3/24/19, 6:33 PM - Parker: but i applaud the ambition
3/24/19, 6:33 PM - Collin Hurst: Even harder if you're dumb
3/24/19, 6:34 PM - Parker: i wasn’t gonna be the one to say it
3/24/19, 6:37 PM - Vaughn: Hey now i have a better idea of my limits
3/24/19, 6:37 PM - Collin Hurst: 🙋🏻‍♂️
3/24/19, 6:38 PM - Vaughn: Is that a high five?

3/31/19, 1:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ukraine election: Comedian leads presidential contest - exit poll
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-47767440
3/31/19, 1:10 PM - Alex Starr: Please we elected a retarded racist muppet
3/31/19, 1:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ok fair
3/31/19, 1:10 PM - Matt Casali: No one outdoes the usa
3/31/19, 1:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: It was just closer to the black mirror episode
3/31/19, 1:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: The Waldo moment
3/31/19, 1:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: But you right
3/31/19, 1:13 PM - Alex Starr: That’s true
3/31/19, 1:13 PM - Alex Starr: But al Franken was a sold senator
3/31/19, 1:13 PM - Alex Starr: Solid
3/31/19, 1:19 PM - Jason Greenberg: I didn’t say a comedian Ukraine president would be bad
3/31/19, 1:20 PM - Alex Starr: That’s true
3/31/19, 1:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: Good political comedy can often come from a solid grasp of ridiculous aspects of government, clearly
3/31/19, 1:21 PM - Alex Starr: Not the strongest argument ever made
3/31/19, 1:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: Depends on what you’re arguing for
3/31/19, 1:21 PM - Alex Starr: It depends on what your definition of is is
3/31/19, 1:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: I don’t know much about al Franken or this Ukraine guy
3/31/19, 1:22 PM - Darren: John Oliver for prime minister
3/31/19, 1:22 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’m not not down
3/31/19, 3:19 PM - Matt Casali: Didnt Al Franken resign after allegations of sexual harassment?
3/31/19, 4:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yes and apparently they weren’t well vetted
3/31/19, 4:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/585739/
3/31/19, 4:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: TLDR: We should examine the evidence properly and people losing their jobs as a result of unsubstantiated accusations is a bad for several reasons
3/31/19, 4:18 PM - Matt Casali: Okey
3/31/19, 6:49 PM - Vaughn: https://youtu.be/lPBiXMcf_-8
3/31/19, 7:00 PM - Alex Starr: Missed opportunity not making dark pits longer than pits
3/31/19, 7:07 PM - Matt Casali: I only care about Ganondorf's, Kirby's and ZSS's
3/31/19, 7:07 PM - Alex Starr: Matt you have my switch
3/31/19, 7:09 PM - Matt Casali: Collin has it

3/31/19, 8:31 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz my parents will be asleep in like half an hour
3/31/19, 8:43 PM - Vaughn: We're sorry for the late response
3/31/19, 8:44 PM - Vaughn: Cause we're in santa cruz now
3/31/19, 8:44 PM - Vaughn: But the next time one of us head home we will drop it off
3/31/19, 8:44 PM - Alex Starr: Okay sounds good

3/31/19, 9:01 PM - Tim Ko: ^some good ole amazon non prime member shipping
4/1/19, 12:19 AM - Matt Casali: UC people
4/1/19, 12:19 AM - Matt Casali: I think we all have access to a site called kanopy and it's a streaming service for documentaries and festival films and such
4/1/19, 12:20 AM - Matt Casali: I just watched a doc called what is democracy and it was super good
4/1/19, 12:20 AM - Matt Casali: I'd highly recommend
4/1/19, 7:39 PM - Tim Ko: A’s have played 7 games this season
4/1/19, 7:39 PM - Tim Ko: Khris Davis already has 5 homeruns
4/1/19, 7:50 PM - Parker: daaamn
4/1/19, 7:50 PM - Parker: gonna lead the league again
4/1/19, 7:54 PM - Tim Ko: Yeahh
4/2/19, 12:08 AM - Ricky: He is insane
4/2/19, 12:09 AM - Ricky: the A's besides like the dodgers must have the most homeruns in baseball rn
4/2/19, 12:09 AM - Ricky: they insane but have absolutely no small ball ahah
4/2/19, 12:09 AM - Parker: hey dingers get the job done
4/2/19, 12:09 AM - Parker: if you hit enough of them haha
4/2/19, 12:09 AM - Ricky: also, kinda random and idk if its that good, but i did 50 consecutive clean but fast pushups
4/2/19, 12:16 AM - Ricky: v proud and wanted to share
4/2/19, 12:16 AM - Ricky: ok gnight
4/2/19, 12:22 AM - Collin Hurst: Eyyyy that's legit
4/2/19, 12:22 AM - Collin Hurst: Gang gang
4/2/19, 12:27 AM - Parker: gang
4/2/19, 12:43 AM - Tim Ko: Gang gang
4/2/19, 12:43 AM - Tim Ko: Chicks dig the long ball
4/2/19, 6:23 PM - Darren: Wtf my housemate from socal just referred to ranch 99 as "99 Ranch"
4/2/19, 6:23 PM - Darren: This is worse than the highways
4/2/19, 6:24 PM - Darren: Fuck I was wrong, it is 99 ranch
4/2/19, 6:24 PM - Alex Starr: It’s actually 99 ranch?
4/2/19, 6:25 PM - Alex Starr: That sounds like the only salad someone from Wisconsin would order
4/2/19, 6:33 PM - Matt Casali: Still horrible
4/2/19, 6:38 PM - Tim Ko: Nope
4/2/19, 6:38 PM - Tim Ko: It’s ranch 99
4/2/19, 6:39 PM - Tim Ko: SoCal got it wrong
4/2/19, 6:46 PM - Parker: i mean the sign has always had it ordered 99 ranch
4/2/19, 6:46 PM - Parker: but that doesn’t flow the same
4/2/19, 6:50 PM - Matt Casali: Well we havent said 99 ranch for 10+ years
4/2/19, 7:01 PM - Alex Starr: I have to say, the fact that it is spelled in that order is compelling
4/2/19, 8:05 PM - Parker: ^
4/2/19, 8:05 PM - Parker: i always wondered that in the back of my mind but didn’t wanna question the norm hahah
4/2/19, 8:06 PM - Darren: Just because a thing is true doesn't make it right
4/2/19, 8:11 PM - Parker: Just because it’s something that we’ve called it for years doesn’t make it right either though
4/2/19, 8:12 PM - Darren: Ranch 99 sounds like a vaguely sci fi name. 99 ranch sounds like it was made by someone with limited mastery of the English language, which coincidentally it was
4/2/19, 8:35 PM - Tim Ko: Ehh well in Chinese ppl just say 99
4/2/19, 8:56 PM - Alex Starr: The founder is Taiwanese though
4/2/19, 8:57 PM - Alex Starr: So it’s country of origin is questionable at best
4/2/19, 8:57 PM - Darren: What's that supposed to mean
4/2/19, 8:59 PM - Alex Starr: Isn’t there some question as to whether Taiwan is owned by China?
4/2/19, 9:00 PM - Alex Starr: A full blown we will cease diplomatic recognition of your country if you recognize Taiwan as a sovereign entity level of question?
4/2/19, 9:01 PM - Darren: Yes
4/2/19, 9:01 PM - Darren: But I don't see how that's relevant
4/2/19, 9:02 PM - Alex Starr: Well if Taiwan is not Chinese, and Tim saying that Chinese people say 99 is not relevant as it was named by a Taiwanese man
4/2/19, 9:02 PM - Alex Starr: We need to know what Taiwanese people call it
4/2/19, 9:03 PM - Alex Starr: Then not and
4/2/19, 9:04 PM - Ricky: Taiwanese people call it 99 market
4/2/19, 9:04 PM - Ricky: Or at least my Taiwanese friends
4/2/19, 9:04 PM - Alex Starr: So 99 market it is
4/2/19, 9:04 PM - Alex Starr: As an American, I will continue to call it Berkeley with more raw fish or that confusing Asian store
4/2/19, 9:08 PM - Alex Starr: This is where Tim refuses to recognize 99 market as a sovereign name
4/2/19, 9:12 PM - Tim Ko: They primarily speak Chinese in Taiwan
4/2/19, 9:13 PM - Tim Ko: And I’m pretty sure 99 is Cantonese market
4/2/19, 9:13 PM - Alex Starr: Founded by a Taiwanese guy
4/2/19, 9:13 PM - Alex Starr: Plus according to Ricky it is called 99 market by Taiwanese folk
4/2/19, 9:13 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah but its Cantonese style
4/2/19, 9:14 PM - Darren: My mom calls it ranch 99
4/2/19, 9:14 PM - Alex Starr: Damn it
4/2/19, 9:14 PM - Darren: Or "shitty marina"
4/2/19, 9:14 PM - Tim Ko: Lmao
4/2/19, 9:14 PM - Tim Ko: Marina is mandarin style
4/2/19, 9:14 PM - Alex Starr: Exactly what China says about Taiwan
4/2/19, 9:15 PM - Alex Starr: Where’s marina?
4/2/19, 9:15 PM - Darren: Closest is in Cupertino
4/2/19, 9:15 PM - Alex Starr: Is it less or more confusing than ranch 99?
4/2/19, 9:18 PM - Darren: It's pretty much the same, but with a superior bakery
4/2/19, 9:18 PM - Alex Starr: You have my attention
4/2/19, 9:20 PM - Matt Casali: I call it the place that gave me good dumplings
4/2/19, 9:22 PM - Alex Starr: I did not know those existed
4/2/19, 9:23 PM - Alex Starr: Actually scratch that
4/2/19, 10:26 PM - Collin Hurst: Cut the 99 talk
4/2/19, 10:28 PM - Alex Starr: ?
4/2/19, 10:28 PM - Alex Starr: What’s 99?
4/2/19, 10:43 PM - Matt Casali: I have never hated bad internet more than I do now
4/2/19, 10:43 PM - Alex Starr: So far
4/2/19, 10:44 PM - Matt Casali: That's what I said haha
4/2/19, 10:45 PM - Alex Starr: Right but always gotta keep in mind you’ll hate it more soon
4/2/19, 10:49 PM - Darren: I'll bite
4/2/19, 10:49 PM - Darren: Why?
4/2/19, 10:53 PM - Alex Starr: Tactical error
4/2/19, 10:54 PM - Collin Hurst: Pinchr
4/2/19, 10:54 PM - Collin Hurst: Piche
4/2/19, 11:05 PM - Tim Ko: I’m always frustrated with bad internet
4/2/19, 11:05 PM - Tim Ko: Like damn it I pay u guys to provide me internet
4/2/19, 11:05 PM - Tim Ko: Why are u not
4/2/19, 11:05 PM - Tim Ko: Just doesn’t make sense
4/2/19, 11:10 PM - Collin Hurst: Piche
4/2/19, 11:10 PM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
4/2/19, 11:11 PM - Matt Casali: Send a snap of how many people there are
4/2/19, 11:11 PM - Matt Casali: I wanna see how crowded it gets

4/3/19, 9:30 AM - Matt Casali: Congratulations!
4/3/19, 9:31 AM - Collin Hurst: Went to bed drunk at 3 and woke up for my 9:20 at Kresge without an alarm
4/3/19, 9:31 AM - Matt Casali: That is impressive
4/3/19, 9:31 AM - Alex Starr: If that’s the key to apotheosis I’m surprised there aren’t more gods
4/3/19, 9:32 AM - Collin Hurst: Going to kresge is like waking up at Vaughn's house and walking to in n out for breakfast
4/3/19, 9:32 AM - Alex Starr: A bad idea cuz they are closed?
4/3/19, 9:33 AM - Collin Hurst: Still probably a better idea than going to this class
4/3/19, 9:34 AM - Alex Starr: Which one is it?
4/3/19, 9:34 AM - Matt Casali: Kresge is not that far away
4/3/19, 9:34 AM - Matt Casali: In n out is not 10-15 minutes away from vaughns house
4/3/19, 9:36 AM - Collin Hurst: Could be 1 hr who knows
4/3/19, 9:37 AM - Matt Casali: I do
4/3/19, 9:37 AM - Matt Casali: I know
4/3/19, 9:37 AM - Collin Hurst: You're the one that said it takes 15 mins to get to media center
4/3/19, 9:37 AM - Matt Casali: Cause it does?
4/3/19, 9:37 AM - Matt Casali: They're the same distance
4/3/19, 9:37 AM - Collin Hurst: So it's longer than that
4/3/19, 9:38 AM - Alex Starr: What class? Actually what classes are everyone taking?
4/3/19, 9:38 AM - Matt Casali: Noooo
4/3/19, 9:38 AM - Matt Casali: It takes 15 minutes
4/3/19, 9:38 AM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
4/3/19, 9:39 AM - Matt Casali: Are you flying there?
4/3/19, 9:42 AM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
4/3/19, 9:42 AM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
4/3/19, 9:43 AM - Collin Hurst: Mhm yup
4/3/19, 9:48 AM - Matt Casali: The point is: I built up my ethos with being right about the distance to the media theater
4/3/19, 9:49 AM - Collin Hurst: Sure sure
4/3/19, 9:50 AM - Matt Casali: You just dont know
4/3/19, 9:50 AM - Matt Casali: You're a noob
4/3/19, 9:51 AM - Collin Hurst: You said they were the same distance
4/3/19, 9:51 AM - Collin Hurst: They clearly are not
4/3/19, 9:51 AM - Collin Hurst: Ethos - 1
4/3/19, 9:52 AM - Matt Casali: Well not if you walk the Google maps way to kresge
4/3/19, 9:52 AM - Collin Hurst: But it's ok don't worry about it
4/3/19, 9:52 AM - Matt Casali: No _you_ dont worry about it
4/3/19, 10:03 AM - Collin Hurst: I'm not
4/3/19, 10:04 AM - Matt Casali: That's good
4/3/19, 10:04 AM - Matt Casali: Stress has a negative impact on your healrh
4/3/19, 10:08 AM - Alex Starr: Is a 30 minute walk typical to get to class even while living on campus? Asking cuz my brother is considering going to UCSC
4/3/19, 10:08 AM - Matt Casali: No 15 minutes is typical

4/15/19, 1:28 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah a spire collapsed too
4/15/19, 1:29 PM - Alex Starr: Ik and the other one is still in danger.
4/15/19, 2:09 PM - Parker: yeah super sad
4/15/19, 2:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: The first thing I thought was I'm glad I saw it
4/15/19, 2:16 PM - Darren: ^
4/15/19, 2:39 PM - Alex Starr: Mine was so many people won’t get to see it
4/15/19, 3:02 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah damn man
4/15/19, 4:48 PM - Matt Casali: *Spoiler alert* I realized why the guy who fucks Cersi, weirds me out so much: its cause he looks like a really creepy guy in one of my classes
4/15/19, 4:49 PM - Alex Starr: Matt writing spoiler alert before your message does jack shit
4/15/19, 4:49 PM - Alex Starr: I have not seen the most recent episode, please don’t discuss it
4/15/19, 4:53 PM - Collin Hurst: you have to make it harder read
4/15/19, 4:54 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah all spoilers have to be encrypted with RSA
4/15/19, 5:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: You also have to say what it’s a spoiler for before you give the alert
4/15/19, 5:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: For this system to work
4/15/19, 5:03 PM - Alex Starr: Or make it longer so I don’t read the whole message then process that it said spoiler alert
4/15/19, 5:04 PM - Collin Hurst: *Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert*
4/15/19, 5:04 PM - Collin Hurst: msg content
4/15/19, 5:04 PM - Collin Hurst: *Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert**Spoiler alert*
4/15/19, 5:04 PM - Collin Hurst: but in one message
4/15/19, 5:04 PM - Alex Starr: No I like 3 messages
4/15/19, 5:05 PM - Parker: hahahaha
4/15/19, 5:06 PM - Parker: weak matt
4/15/19, 5:15 PM - Alex Starr: Just don’t post spoilers at all
4/15/19, 5:15 PM - Alex Starr: Or at least spell Cersei right
4/15/19, 5:37 PM - Matt Casali: No thanks
4/15/19, 5:41 PM - Alex Starr: To both?
4/15/19, 6:08 PM - Collin Hurst: Me too, in the assassin's Creed brotherhood  campaign
4/15/19, 6:08 PM - Matt Casali: Ur weak
4/15/19, 6:08 PM - Matt Casali: All ya gotta do is read the first part, stop, and hide the message from yourself
4/15/19, 6:10 PM - Darren: Didn't play assassin's Creed Unity, eh?
4/15/19, 6:10 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t read messages like that
4/15/19, 6:11 PM - Darren: He reads every character in a message concurrently and then reconstructs it all at once
4/15/19, 6:11 PM - Matt Casali: K I'll fix it
4/15/19, 6:11 PM - Darren: At least specify *spoiler warning for GoT*
4/15/19, 6:12 PM - Darren: Otherwise I might accidentally care about the spoilers
4/15/19, 6:12 PM - Alex Starr: Every word usually for not blocks of text
4/15/19, 6:12 PM - Matt Casali: *Spoiler alert* I *Spoiler alert* realized why the *Spoiler alert* guy who *Spoiler alert* fucks Cersi, *Spoiler alert* weirds me out so much: its cause he looks like a really creepy guy in one of my classes
4/15/19, 6:13 PM - Darren: See that still doesn't help me because I don't know what it's a spoiler for
4/15/19, 6:14 PM - Matt Casali: And if I alerted you to that, the cycle would go on and on
4/15/19, 6:14 PM - Darren: That's a false slippery slope and you know it
4/15/19, 6:14 PM - Darren: But I agree that you shouldn't post anymore
4/15/19, 6:17 PM - Parker: spoiler alerts are a myth anyways so it’s okay guys
4/15/19, 6:18 PM - Alex Starr: Like Delaware
4/15/19, 6:20 PM - Parker: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/thriving101/201108/the-spoiler-paradox?amp
4/15/19, 6:21 PM - Alex Starr: Oh I thought u were joking
4/15/19, 6:21 PM - Ricky: Haha
4/15/19, 6:21 PM - Parker: I wasn’t fully serious but i have had this stance in the last to be fair
4/15/19, 6:22 PM - Parker: past*
4/15/19, 6:22 PM - Alex Starr: Idk it depends for me, sometimes I care but sometimes I don’t but generally I agree
4/15/19, 6:24 PM - Alex Starr: But GOT spoilers are a goddamn no no
4/15/19, 6:25 PM - Vaughn: *GOT SPOILER ALERT* 


Matts a beeeg fohkhead
4/15/19, 6:25 PM - Vaughn: <Media omitted>
4/15/19, 6:25 PM - Alex Starr: But then you have to spam the chat to bury it
4/15/19, 6:26 PM - Matt Casali: Just fucking watch the show when it comes out and stop crying about it
4/15/19, 6:27 PM - Alex Starr: I want to watch it on a big tv, which I don’t have
4/15/19, 6:27 PM - Alex Starr: But I do have one at home
4/15/19, 6:28 PM - Matt Casali: Omgggg
4/15/19, 6:32 PM - Darren: I'm surprised a GoT survivors chat hasn't been suggested yet
4/15/19, 6:34 PM - Matt Casali: I just didnt think saying a guy fucks Cersei would get everyone so pissed
4/15/19, 6:34 PM - Alex Starr: I thought about it, but felt it might be productive
4/15/19, 6:34 PM - Alex Starr: No one is pissed
4/15/19, 6:34 PM - Alex Starr: Just giving you shit
4/15/19, 6:34 PM - Darren: Matt is pissed
4/15/19, 6:35 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah but he no longer exists cuz he posted spoilers
4/15/19, 6:35 PM - Matt Casali: I can feel myself turning to dust, Mr. Stark
4/15/19, 6:35 PM - Darren: Is that what Parker's article said? Because I'm suddenly interested
4/15/19, 6:35 PM - Matt Casali: Oh shit sorry
4/15/19, 6:36 PM - Alex Starr: That was my takeaway
4/15/19, 6:37 PM - Parker: wat
4/15/19, 6:37 PM - Parker: i suddenly feel less sympathy for you
4/15/19, 6:37 PM - Ricky: lol
4/15/19, 6:37 PM - Ricky: lets all agree
4/15/19, 6:37 PM - Parker: that GOT is overrated
4/15/19, 6:38 PM - Ricky: Matt could maek a better effort to have spoiler warnings and Alex is big baby
4/15/19, 6:38 PM - Ricky: also christmas pud is the video of our and all generations
4/15/19, 6:41 PM - Parker: ^^
4/15/19, 6:43 PM - Alex Starr: I agree with neither
4/15/19, 6:45 PM - Darren: Alex is big baby
4/16/19, 11:40 AM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
4/16/19, 11:43 AM - Alex Starr: It implies that you are capable of knowing your “truth” which I thoroughly disagree with
4/16/19, 11:43 AM - Matt Casali: Well I disagree with your truth
4/16/19, 11:44 AM - Alex Starr: Suddenly a big fan of agree to disagree eh?
4/16/19, 11:44 AM - Jason Greenberg: I disagree with the wording of your truth because that implies that there can be multiple truths
4/16/19, 11:45 AM - Alex Starr: There are multiple truths though
4/16/19, 11:45 AM - Jason Greenberg: But I agree that honesty with you partner is paramount to good sex when considering quality of relationship
4/16/19, 11:45 AM - Jason Greenberg: Ok got me but what should be there is ‘your opinion’
4/16/19, 11:46 AM - Alex Starr: That’s a bingo
4/16/19, 11:46 AM - Matt Casali: Truth is like tooth but with an r
4/16/19, 11:46 AM - Jason Greenberg: Thank you Matt
4/16/19, 11:46 AM - Jason Greenberg: I’ll keep that in mind
4/16/19, 11:46 AM - Matt Casali: Glad I could contribute to a nonsense conversation!
4/16/19, 11:47 AM - Alex Starr: The bevy of insights you provide continues to astound and inform
4/16/19, 11:47 AM - Alex Starr: You started it
4/16/19, 11:53 AM - Matt Casali: Yes, yes I did
4/16/19, 11:56 AM - Alex Starr: Speaking of nonsense, I am increasingly regretting my choices of what to study in college
4/16/19, 11:56 AM - Alex Starr: And it seems too late to pivot
4/16/19, 12:01 PM - Parker: how come
4/16/19, 12:02 PM - Vaughn: Oh no matt
4/16/19, 12:02 PM - Vaughn: I cant believe youve done this
4/16/19, 12:02 PM - Tim Ko: I feel like there are different types of intimacy
4/16/19, 12:03 PM - Tim Ko: Physical, emotional, spiritual
4/16/19, 12:06 PM - Matt Casali: Truthful?
4/16/19, 12:06 PM - Vaughn: Its different for everyone, i think the most intimate thing is whatever you share with the least amount of people
4/16/19, 12:07 PM - Vaughn: Sex isnt very intimate to a prostitute
4/16/19, 12:07 PM - Vaughn: But sharing your story about your abusive parents to someone for the first time might be more intimate
4/16/19, 12:09 PM - Ricky: Same, kinda wish I did advertising
4/16/19, 12:10 PM - Ricky: Friends, I have had food poisoning since 2 am
4/16/19, 12:10 PM - Ricky: I feel like someone just poured a vat of gasoline in my stomach and lit it on fire
4/16/19, 12:10 PM - Ricky: Not that bad
4/16/19, 12:10 PM - Ricky: I’m being dramatic
4/16/19, 12:10 PM - Ricky: But like, I slept 0 between 2 am and 8 am because it hurt so bad
4/16/19, 12:11 PM - Vaughn: What did you eat?
4/16/19, 12:14 PM - Alex Starr: I’m gonna guess 37$ worth of gas station sushi
4/16/19, 12:19 PM - Alex Starr: Not much clarity on what I should do/I’m not sure how much I like actually applying things to real life
4/16/19, 12:21 PM - Ricky: I’m p sure it was a al pastor burrito from yesterday yeehaw
4/16/19, 12:23 PM - Tim Ko: Oh shit man
4/16/19, 12:23 PM - Tim Ko: Hope u feel better
4/16/19, 12:23 PM - Vaughn: Oh *shit man*
4/16/19, 12:24 PM - Vaughn: How long does food poisoning last?
4/16/19, 12:25 PM - Collin Hurst: you have to eat something identical to make it stop
4/16/19, 12:25 PM - Collin Hurst: so he needs another al pastor burrito to balance it out
4/16/19, 12:26 PM - Vaughn: Nah i think for perfect balance he needs to shove another al pastor burrito up his ass
4/16/19, 12:26 PM - Vaughn: Have em meet in the middle and balance things out
4/16/19, 12:26 PM - Collin Hurst: that could work too
4/16/19, 12:28 PM - Alex Starr: Would al pastor tacos work?
4/16/19, 12:28 PM - Alex Starr: Or a carnitas burrito?
4/16/19, 12:29 PM - Darren: No, it's got to be 9 inches of barbecued pork up his ass or it's not gonna work
4/16/19, 12:29 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz if I needed Mexican food shoved up my ass, Id prefer a taco
4/16/19, 12:29 PM - Alex Starr: I was worried about that
4/16/19, 12:29 PM - Parker: shut the fuck up hahaha
4/16/19, 12:29 PM - Collin Hurst: id take a taquito
4/16/19, 12:29 PM - Parker: ^
4/16/19, 12:29 PM - Parker: damn i’m sorry rick
4/16/19, 12:29 PM - Matt Casali: I think I read a paper on that
4/16/19, 12:29 PM - Alex Starr: Those are rough and crispy
4/16/19, 12:30 PM - Alex Starr: It’d be like a roll of sandpaper
4/16/19, 12:30 PM - Alex Starr: Soft bean flour taco on the other hand might as well be shit
4/16/19, 12:30 PM - Collin Hurst: true
4/16/19, 12:34 PM - Vaughn: <Media omitted>
4/16/19, 12:35 PM - Vaughn: <Media omitted>
4/16/19, 12:35 PM - Vaughn: <Media omitted>
4/16/19, 12:37 PM - Matt Casali: Hahahaha
4/16/19, 12:44 PM - Ricky: do you not have Darren's name saved on ur phone?
4/16/19, 12:45 PM - Collin Hurst: vaughn doesnt save contact names
4/16/19, 12:45 PM - Collin Hurst: i have no idea why its so inconvinient
4/16/19, 12:45 PM - Ricky: he literally only doesn't have darren's though haha
4/16/19, 12:45 PM - Collin Hurst: idk
4/16/19, 12:46 PM - Collin Hurst: all i know is if he wants to call someone he has to look at text convos to decide who it is before calling them
4/16/19, 12:46 PM - Vaughn: Darren is saved in my phone im pretty sure but not whatsapp
4/16/19, 12:46 PM - Vaughn: Unless if thats not how it works and im dumb
4/16/19, 12:47 PM - Vaughn: Nvm i have his old number saved
4/16/19, 1:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: Sorry for the intestinal distress rick
4/16/19, 1:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: Is there other stuff you would have liked to study?
4/16/19, 1:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: Instead
4/16/19, 1:52 PM - Alex Starr: Theoretical math stuff I think
4/16/19, 1:53 PM - Alex Starr: Everything is so clean there
4/16/19, 1:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: What do you look for in a good career? Jc
4/16/19, 1:57 PM - Alex Starr: Interesting, fun, something I could see myself dedicating a dangerous amount of time to
4/16/19, 2:01 PM - Darren: How many career paths do you think fit that?
4/16/19, 2:04 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t know, presumably quite a few
4/16/19, 2:05 PM - Darren: That was a poorly aimed question
4/16/19, 2:07 PM - Darren: How many career paths fit that criteria and contribute somewhat to your current regret regarding undergrad studies
4/16/19, 2:08 PM - Alex Starr: Basically non-applied math and physics research
4/16/19, 2:23 PM - Darren: Physics research?
4/16/19, 2:24 PM - Alex Starr: More math side
4/16/19, 2:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: Is your regret correctable?
4/16/19, 2:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: In a feasible way?
4/16/19, 3:18 PM - Alex Starr: Not so much
4/16/19, 3:19 PM - Jason Greenberg: Maybe the answer is to get ripped
4/16/19, 3:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: When in doubt, get ripped
4/16/19, 3:20 PM - Alex Starr: Drunk or muscular or both?
4/16/19, 3:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: Well you can do both but I was going for brawny
4/16/19, 3:22 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t think it’d do much
4/16/19, 3:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah but I’m interested to hear what you end up doing
4/16/19, 3:42 PM - Alex Starr: So am I
4/16/19, 3:42 PM - Alex Starr: Wish there was a lot more clarity
4/16/19, 3:54 PM - Darren: @16507145032 I feel like you're academically interested in enough subjects (basically all of stem) that you'd be having some form of regret no matter what 2 majors you picked
4/16/19, 3:58 PM - Alex Starr: I agree, but in my quest to learn generally about a lot of stem areas I’ve kinda fucked myself cuz:
Interdisciplinary research is all I’m really qualified for and it tends to be really applied and pretty brutal.
It is also really unclear what exactly I’d end up doing.
Lastly it’s also really unclear what exactly I am qualified/prepared for, it seems like I’m screwed for any “pure” subject.
4/16/19, 4:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: Screwed for any pure subject at like elite schools right?
4/16/19, 4:02 PM - Alex Starr: It’s pretty close to full stop
4/16/19, 4:02 PM - Alex Starr: At least from what I’ve gathered
4/16/19, 4:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: Does that mean a nonelite school is not an option?
4/16/19, 4:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: For you
4/16/19, 4:06 PM - Darren: I still recommend the path of getting a job in the field you want to go to grad school for, then apply once you have that targeted experience
4/16/19, 4:08 PM - Alex Starr: Means I might not be able to get in
4/16/19, 4:08 PM - Alex Starr: There isn’t really a job like that for research though
4/16/19, 4:12 PM - Darren: Not 1:1, but I have a hard time believing there isn't something close enough
4/16/19, 4:13 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lab managers and masters degrees go to the top of application stacks in the social sciences. Idk if that is paralleled in hard sciences
4/16/19, 4:14 PM - Tim Ko: Not too late to be a doctor Alex!
4/16/19, 4:53 PM - Parker: any experience is experience
4/16/19, 4:53 PM - Parker: you can’t worry too much about finding the perfect job out of college
4/16/19, 4:53 PM - Parker: even though most people do
4/16/19, 4:58 PM - Alex Starr: For math at least, you aren’t qualified to really think about research until you have a couple years of grad classes
4/16/19, 7:26 PM - Collin Hurst: Lol parker the lightning got swept
4/16/19, 7:28 PM - Collin Hurst: They were 2 wins away from tying the best season record ever and then they got demolished lmao
4/16/19, 7:30 PM - Parker: Yeah dude crazy hahaha
4/16/19, 7:30 PM - Parker: they choked hard core
4/16/19, 7:31 PM - Parker: makes the sharks path easier if they can get their head out of their ass
4/16/19, 7:32 PM - Collin Hurst: YeH
4/16/19, 7:32 PM - Collin Hurst: We need vlasic
4/16/19, 7:38 PM - Alex Starr: Pretty sure pickles would just lead to more choking
4/16/19, 7:48 PM - Parker: facts
4/16/19, 7:48 PM - Parker: they need to cut jones
4/16/19, 7:48 PM - Parker: like he’s booty
4/17/19, 12:16 AM - Matt Casali: HOLY FUCKING FUCK
4/17/19, 12:16 AM - Matt Casali: The OA is so good
4/17/19, 12:17 AM - Collin Hurst: Ok ok ok jeez
4/17/19, 12:17 AM - Matt Casali: Finish the second season
4/17/19, 12:17 AM - Matt Casali: Its so good
4/17/19, 12:18 AM - Matt Casali: I think its maybe my favorite show now
4/17/19, 12:31 AM - Darren: What is it
4/17/19, 12:31 AM - Darren: Besides the greatest thing known to man
4/17/19, 12:32 AM - Collin Hurst: Wow
4/17/19, 12:33 AM - Matt Casali: A show on Netflix that's kinda hard to explain
4/17/19, 12:33 AM - Darren: Off to a great start
4/17/19, 12:47 AM - Matt Casali: It's the type of show that makes you guess whether or not it's in their heads or its real
4/17/19, 12:48 AM - Matt Casali: And it just continuously fucks with you
4/17/19, 12:48 AM - Matt Casali: In an amazingly well constructed way
4/17/19, 6:47 AM - Ricky: YOU ALREADY FINISHED?!
4/17/19, 6:48 AM - Ricky: second season is wild as fuck
4/17/19, 7:51 AM - Alex Starr: Come on he really tried
4/17/19, 10:31 AM - Matt Casali: Did you finish it?
4/17/19, 10:32 AM - Matt Casali: Also, did people see the joker moveset?
4/17/19, 11:10 AM - Darren: Looking cool, joker
4/17/19, 11:12 AM - Darren: Depending on how good his confirms / persona are, he could be honest or obnoxious in a cloud kinda way
4/17/19, 11:13 AM - Matt Casali: I agree
4/17/19, 11:14 AM - Matt Casali: Seemed similar to cloud
4/17/19, 11:15 AM - Matt Casali: Except the limit would stay with him even if he gets killed
4/17/19, 11:16 AM - Darren: I'm just hoping his gun isn't great in neutral
4/18/19, 3:33 PM - Tim Ko: KD staying for 2 more years!
4/18/19, 3:33 PM - Collin Hurst: Eyyyy
4/18/19, 3:34 PM - Tim Ko: Khris Davis that’s is 😂
4/18/19, 3:34 PM - Collin Hurst: Oh
4/18/19, 3:37 PM - Matt Casali: Got em
4/18/19, 3:39 PM - Ricky: don't worry, thats who i thought u were saying
4/18/19, 3:39 PM - Ricky: ganggggg
4/18/19, 3:39 PM - Ricky: lets pull out a WS before then gang
4/18/19, 3:43 PM - Tim Ko: GANGGG
4/18/19, 3:43 PM - Tim Ko: Hahahaha
4/18/19, 3:50 PM - Ricky: https://www.crawfishboxes.com/2019/4/18/18484903/did-tim-andersons-bat-flip-cross-the-line
4/18/19, 3:50 PM - Ricky: this bat flip haha
4/18/19, 4:19 PM - Alex Starr: We had better while mini golfing
4/18/19, 4:21 PM - Ricky: lmao
4/18/19, 4:21 PM - Ricky: i cna't argue with that
4/18/19, 4:23 PM - Alex Starr: Mini golfing is 10x more fun when it’s empty
4/18/19, 4:26 PM - Ricky: haha agreed, and when wet and having a mostly blind member
4/18/19, 4:26 PM - Alex Starr: I was actually damn near blind yesterday
4/18/19, 4:27 PM - Alex Starr: I tried out a sleep mask, but it shifted my contacts so they bent my eyes out of shape so I had a blurry morning
4/18/19, 4:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: Do you where contacts to sleep?
4/18/19, 4:28 PM - Ricky: oh fuck, sounds like a trippy morning
4/18/19, 4:28 PM - Ricky: both physically and mentally
4/18/19, 4:29 PM - Alex Starr: Haha
4/18/19, 4:29 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah they alter the shape of my eyes so then I have 20/20 in the morning without contacts
4/18/19, 4:29 PM - Ricky: i appreciate the pity laugh
4/18/19, 4:30 PM - Alex Starr: No I actually laughed aloud
4/18/19, 4:30 PM - Alex Starr: The pity laugh is lol
4/18/19, 4:30 PM - Darren: He laughed aloud, he didn't laugh out loud
4/18/19, 4:30 PM - Parker: nice
4/18/19, 4:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: Do you know how much they cost?
4/18/19, 4:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: That sounds cool
4/18/19, 4:40 PM - Tim Ko: Alex u should try just wearing it in one eye one night
4/18/19, 4:40 PM - Tim Ko: I saw that lmao
4/18/19, 4:47 PM - Darren: It's cool that you can squeeze your eye into working better
4/18/19, 4:49 PM - Ricky: work that cornea boi
4/18/19, 4:55 PM - Alex Starr: Roughly the same as a year of soft contacts, but double that for the first year
4/18/19, 4:55 PM - Alex Starr: They are very uncomfortable
4/18/19, 4:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hmm they look expensive to set up
4/18/19, 4:56 PM - Alex Starr: Yep but they can last two years if ur careful
4/18/19, 4:56 PM - Alex Starr: So after 4 years ur even
4/18/19, 4:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: Is it like daily lenses?
4/18/19, 4:57 PM - Alex Starr: No hard contacts you keep them for 1-2 years
4/18/19, 4:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: Wow high stakes
4/18/19, 4:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: I lose important objects frequently could be bad
4/18/19, 5:09 PM - Tim Ko: Hard contacts also prevents ur eyes from getting worse
4/18/19, 5:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: Really?
4/18/19, 5:10 PM - Tim Ko: Or lessens the progression
4/18/19, 5:10 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah
4/18/19, 5:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: Interesting
4/18/19, 5:10 PM - Tim Ko: My mom always wanted me to get em but I refused
4/18/19, 5:10 PM - Tim Ko: Now my left eye is -6.75 lmao
4/18/19, 5:10 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah these completely stop vision degradation
4/18/19, 5:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lmaoo
4/18/19, 5:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Do you happen to know if your particular insurance covered them?
4/18/19, 5:41 PM - Alex Starr: It helped but didn’t cover it completely a la soft contacts
4/19/19, 10:26 AM - Parker: https://www.facebook.com/104266592953439/posts/2645732815473458?sfns=mo
4/19/19, 10:38 AM - Tim Ko: Lmaoooooo 😂😂
4/20/19, 3:59 AM - Parker: happy holidaze boys
4/20/19, 8:04 AM - Alex Starr: 4/20 then Easter then earth day
4/20/19, 8:04 AM - Alex Starr: I’m of course an earth day fan
4/20/19, 8:07 AM - Alex Starr: Passover too
4/20/19, 8:24 AM - Parker: 4/20 being the most important
4/20/19, 8:35 AM - Ricky: Sign the Alex Honnold petition
4/20/19, 8:36 AM - Ricky: Morning and happy life day
4/20/19, 11:45 AM - Parker: for people who get married today, they’re 50th anniversary will be on 4/20/69
4/20/19, 11:46 AM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha
4/20/19, 1:03 PM - Tim Ko: Lmao
4/20/19, 4:42 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
4/20/19, 7:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: Good
4/20/19, 7:38 PM - Parker: gang
4/20/19, 9:47 PM - Vaughn: Eyyyyy
4/20/19, 11:50 PM - Parker: how was everyone’s day
4/21/19, 12:00 AM - Darren: It was good! Hung out with Matt and Vaughn and Collin. Had a little picnic, ate some burritos, played some smash - finally got to play the new dlc character Joker
4/21/19, 12:07 AM - Parker: Ooo fun
4/21/19, 12:07 AM - Parker: get zooted?
4/21/19, 12:08 AM - Darren: I did not, but they sure did
4/21/19, 12:08 AM - Darren: How was your day?
4/21/19, 12:14 AM - Parker: good then mixed then good
4/21/19, 12:15 AM - Parker: i woke up and smoked and then we went to the spring football game which was fun then i met up with tristyn afterwards and she was upset and we had a long talk which was kinda good and kinda bad but then after that i smoked more with josh and friends and played 2k
4/21/19, 12:15 AM - Parker: for context there’s been a lot of shit and drama this term
4/21/19, 12:15 AM - Parker: far too much to explain but it’s been a lot
4/21/19, 12:17 AM - Darren: Relationship / lack there of drama?
4/21/19, 12:18 AM - Darren: Or a different drama that's pulled you into it?
4/21/19, 12:18 AM - Parker: Hints of it but more so just friend drama
4/21/19, 12:18 AM - Parker: and partly this
4/21/19, 12:18 AM - Parker: but it’s been pretty shitty honestly
4/21/19, 12:19 AM - Parker: i’ve been a #sadboy
4/21/19, 12:23 AM - Darren: That sounds like a perfect storm of shitty drama. Sorry to hear that
4/21/19, 12:24 AM - Darren: If you want to talk about it, I'm sure mostly everyone here wants to support you and would love to lend an ear
4/21/19, 12:34 AM - Parker: It’s way too much to explain especially over text but i know thank you❤
4/21/19, 2:34 AM - Tim Ko: Aw I’m sorry about that
4/21/19, 2:34 AM - Tim Ko: In other news, Julia blocked me on Instagram this weekend! 😂
4/21/19, 5:24 AM - Collin Hurst: Oh wow
4/21/19, 5:24 AM - Collin Hurst: Why
4/21/19, 6:48 AM - Parker: :(
4/21/19, 10:00 AM - Tim Ko: Idk, i was having dinner with a friend the other day and she saw us, maybe she thought I was on a date or something, and then the next day on campus I saw her and she completely ignored me lol and then she blocked me
4/21/19, 10:01 AM - Parker: that’s weird
4/21/19, 10:01 AM - Parker: and immature
4/21/19, 10:02 AM - Matt Casali: Probably just trying to give herself a little extra distance
4/21/19, 10:03 AM - Matt Casali: I dont think it has anything to do with you tim
4/21/19, 10:03 AM - Matt Casali: It happens
4/21/19, 10:05 AM - Parker: yeah but the connotation with blocking is not that
4/21/19, 10:05 AM - Parker: and do u guys even talk or see each other at all?
4/21/19, 10:21 AM - Tim Ko: Rarely see each other, last time I bumped into her was like a month ago and I said hi and initiated a short convo
4/21/19, 10:22 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah true, tho it’s been like 4.5 months and we only dated for 2 months lol
4/21/19, 10:23 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah I felt blocking was overboard and unnessisary
4/21/19, 10:23 AM - Matt Casali: But her choice and you shouldnt let it effect you haha
4/21/19, 10:40 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah i don’t really care
4/21/19, 10:43 AM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah that would feel weird but you’re still golden
4/21/19, 10:47 AM - Collin Hurst: Sounds like what Karissa did
4/21/19, 10:48 AM - Matt Casali: Hahaha
4/21/19, 1:17 PM - Alex Starr: affect*
4/21/19, 1:21 PM - Tim Ko: Hahaha damn
4/21/19, 1:24 PM - Matt Casali: Haha thanks
4/21/19, 1:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: Welcome to the Sunday roast featuring Alex and Matt in an epic _*smackdown*_ of wills!! Get smacked boi!
4/21/19, 2:13 PM - Matt Casali: Silicon Valley Came to Kansas Schools. That Started a Rebellion. https://nyti.ms/2KT7oOy

This sounds like a pyramid scheme
4/21/19, 2:18 PM - Darren: New York times headlines make me sad
4/21/19, 2:20 PM - Matt Casali: Haha it does look bad
4/21/19, 2:21 PM - Matt Casali: You should read it though
4/21/19, 2:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: Is there something about this you want to talk about?
4/21/19, 2:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh a pyramid scheme??
4/21/19, 2:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: How did you get that from the article?
4/21/19, 2:29 PM - Matt Casali: Pyramid scheme may be wrong
4/21/19, 2:30 PM - Alex Starr: I’d have killed for a self paced program
4/21/19, 2:30 PM - Matt Casali: But it's weird that the school administrators are saying things and publicizing things that were in the pitches for summit learning
4/21/19, 2:30 PM - Matt Casali: Just culty is all
4/21/19, 2:33 PM - Alex Starr: Seems worth the sacrifice, unfortunate to see it was so widely rejected
4/21/19, 2:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: Culty that the administrators are using the selling points of the system that they themselves bought into?
4/21/19, 2:34 PM - Darren: ^
4/21/19, 2:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: Seems like we need more data
4/21/19, 2:35 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah
4/21/19, 2:36 PM - Matt Casali: Did any of you read it?
4/21/19, 2:36 PM - Darren: I firmly believe that students at _public_ schools should not be forced to use any form of proprietary software. Summit is given out for free, so if students who didn't want to use it didn't have to, I'd have no qualms about it
4/21/19, 2:36 PM - Matt Casali: I'm not good at summarizing
4/21/19, 2:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: Have you ever bought something and told someone you bought it for x reasons?
4/21/19, 2:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah
4/21/19, 2:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah I agree with that
4/21/19, 2:37 PM - Darren: I read it, and putting my righteousness aside, this sounds like a problem with how the schools are implementing the software into their schools
4/21/19, 2:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: Like ‘hey we got some free software, feel free to use it if you want to get ahead on stuff or research things’
4/21/19, 2:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah the backlash is probably from lack of choice
4/21/19, 2:39 PM - Darren: Also, it's "free" software. The only way personalized learning works is if they collect a literal fuckton of user data. I don't know enough about summit to properly speculate, but its funding by the Zuckerberg Chan institute isn't exactly a sign of trust for data privacy advocates
4/21/19, 2:41 PM - Darren: And k-12 students are one of the largest captive user bases in america
4/21/19, 2:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah those are good points
4/21/19, 2:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: Our administrators were like babies when it came to privacy with the chromebooks
4/21/19, 2:42 PM - Darren: All that aside, self paced personalized education is dope as hell and I would have wanted to have it (if it were good)
4/21/19, 2:43 PM - Matt Casali: I cant say much
4/21/19, 2:43 PM - Matt Casali: But I dont like the hypocrisy that the article pointed out of many silicon valley execs not allowing tech in the home and wanting it out of their schools
4/21/19, 2:43 PM - Matt Casali: Really sketchy
4/21/19, 2:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: I wrote an article about chrome book privacy and found that mvhs’s it ran a pretty unchecked show. It was 3 guys, and 30 percent of them were John Dizon. They had installed default chrome extensions like “Auto YouTube HD” that gave 3rd parties access to ALL of the read and write data on those things
4/21/19, 2:45 PM - Darren: Executives have 1 on 1 private tutors for their children. That's clearly better than the software they can provide right now, but it isn't scaleable. You can't tell some middle class person in Kansas to get a private tutor for their kid
4/21/19, 2:45 PM - Matt Casali: "30 percent of them were John Dizon" hahahah
4/21/19, 2:46 PM - Matt Casali: The article said they went to private schools with no tech
4/21/19, 2:47 PM - Darren: Same difference
4/21/19, 2:47 PM - Darren: Sacred heart isn't gonna be the level of education everyone can get
4/21/19, 2:47 PM - Jason Greenberg: Doesn’t seem as pressing as whether this software is an effective gap mitigator
4/21/19, 2:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: Who cares what they do at home if it isn’t hurting anyone
4/21/19, 2:48 PM - Darren: So the assumption is that sacred heart > personal learning software in poor schools > poor schools without the software
4/21/19, 2:48 PM - Matt Casali: Not always
4/21/19, 2:51 PM - Matt Casali: Is it not?
4/21/19, 2:54 PM - Darren: As far as I know, public schools in SV don't use Summit. Schools like MVHS and Paly don't have that much trouble (relatively) hiring qualified teachers and keeping class sizes (again, relatively) down. If you go to MV, you're gonna get a really solid education from mostly Stanford education school graduates.

But that access to enough good teachers is incredibly rare. In a place where you don't have resources for enough teachers, it's really compelling to switch teachers over from their current role to be more of a mentor - so long as you can replace the direct teacher with software. One issue is that Summit is seemingly not as good as it should be (from reading the article), but making something data driven like Summit good requires iteration and data from users
4/21/19, 2:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: I mean I don’t know who these executives are specifically or what they do with their children but if they tell them to avoid using “technology” in the home no, my first inclination would not be, we need to fix this family
4/21/19, 2:59 PM - Matt Casali: I'm not saying what they're doing is directly hurting anyone
4/21/19, 2:59 PM - Matt Casali: It's what they're not doing, but having everyone else do
4/21/19, 2:59 PM - Matt Casali: So let's test it on a bunch of nobodies in Kansas and fuck up their education
4/21/19, 3:00 PM - Darren: Again, the problem is that there doesn't seem to be choice because of local school officials
4/21/19, 3:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: ^
4/21/19, 3:02 PM - Darren: Say I want to solve homelessness by offering a fancy tent. My children aren't gonna use it because they have a better alternative, but that doesn't mean I'm hypocritical. It's offering a solution for a different market of users. (Pretend there's a big data part of this tent metaphor)
4/21/19, 3:02 PM - Matt Casali: As in, the school has no choice but to implement it?
4/21/19, 3:02 PM - Darren: No
4/21/19, 3:02 PM - Matt Casali: But there's other ways to solve homelessness than a fancy tent
4/21/19, 3:03 PM - Matt Casali: That's a very on the surface, not well though out solution
4/21/19, 3:03 PM - Matt Casali: Like summit learning
4/21/19, 3:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: That would be relevant to bring up in a discussion of hypocracy, but this isn’t super relevant to evaluating the effectiveness of the software and whether is should be used and how it should be used. The latter seems like a more important issue when you get down to affecting change
4/21/19, 3:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: It was a metaphor
4/21/19, 3:05 PM - Darren: Ok, but an AI teacher that can teach you personally is a well thought out solution (the tent was admittedly not). It has side effects, like students feeling isolated from their peers. The problem is that schools aren't accommodating for those side effects when they make the switch
4/21/19, 3:07 PM - Alex Starr: Seems like execution not concept was the major issue with summit
4/21/19, 3:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: Right
4/21/19, 3:07 PM - Matt Casali: I'm extending it
4/21/19, 3:08 PM - Darren: If a school was able to properly account for those side effects (build more communal / not Summit time into their curriculum, put a teacher in The loop, etc), then it would be great. 

One way to do that is to give the students the option to not use it at all (which is logistically challenging but worth it)
4/21/19, 3:08 PM - Matt Casali: They took a certain direction and followed it, but I'm saying the direction seemed wrong
4/21/19, 3:08 PM - Darren: Why was the direction wrong?
4/21/19, 3:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: Also agree with this
4/21/19, 3:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: We should make sure we’re on the same page about what the direction was first
4/21/19, 3:09 PM - Matt Casali: Because people aren't happy
4/21/19, 3:10 PM - Darren: What about the direction is wrong? What is causing them to be unhappy?
4/21/19, 3:10 PM - Alex Starr: Imo the potential benefits of these types of personalized learning platforms are large enough and the changes extensive enough that some hiccups are expected and acceptable
4/21/19, 3:10 PM - Matt Casali: Idk
4/21/19, 3:10 PM - Matt Casali: But they're unhappy
4/21/19, 3:10 PM - Darren: Is it the negative externalities that aren't being addressed properly, or is it the fundamental solution of using a computer as a primary replacement for the teacher?
4/21/19, 3:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: Matt what do you think the direction of the Summit program was?
4/21/19, 3:11 PM - Matt Casali: Hiccup is a severe understatement
4/21/19, 3:11 PM - Alex Starr: Nationally speaking, it was a hiccup
4/21/19, 3:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: Because then you can look at how the metrics of success align with the problem you’re addressing
4/21/19, 3:11 PM - Matt Casali: Okay mr. Utilitarianism
4/21/19, 3:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’m willing to hear you out
4/21/19, 3:13 PM - Alex Starr: I prefer Captain Utilitarianism
4/21/19, 3:13 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
4/21/19, 3:13 PM - Alex Starr: I think the fact that it linked to articles on the web for explanations in a poorly vetted manner was a serious issue
4/21/19, 3:14 PM - Alex Starr: When I heard about a personalized program, I assumed it would be similar to Coursera or other MOOCs, and I think something along those lines and self-paced would be awesome
4/21/19, 3:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: It was also super focused on emotions and didn’t offer much data
4/21/19, 3:14 PM - Darren: A famous philosopher once said "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"
4/21/19, 3:15 PM - Alex Starr: I meant the Summit program, but also the article I guess
4/21/19, 3:20 PM - Darren: I'm inclined to agree with this, although I'd want to know more about why it does this. Is it because of a technical limitation, or they don't have enough content writers, or is it a copyright thing that teachers don't face due to differences in scale? Or is their system automatically searching the web for articles to link to, in which case holy shit pump the breaks Summit
4/21/19, 3:21 PM - Alex Starr: I think it might just be deliberate, Heiken did it a ton right?
4/21/19, 3:24 PM - Darren: He did. He would even link to websites as suspect as the daily mail when it fit the whole "this is an extreme and not totally fair view" to give students a broader perspective. But he would almost always give printouts of the webpage (pre Chromebook) or text from the webpage - not requiring you to go to the website yourself
4/21/19, 3:25 PM - Darren: Which he could get away with, but someone lifting content at scale may run into law suits (whether legitimate or not)
4/21/19, 3:25 PM - Alex Starr: That’s true it was rarely linked
4/21/19, 3:26 PM - Alex Starr: But at least there’s precedent for it making some sense
4/21/19, 3:26 PM - Darren: The NYT article did not say what the purpose for linking to shady websites was. And that context is definitely important
4/21/19, 3:27 PM - Darren: And Zuckerberg doesn't want to get into copyright disputes that could set precedent that could be bad for Facebook... or worse an adblocking dispute
4/21/19, 3:30 PM - Alex Starr: Right so they have to more carefully curate links for sure, tho it sounded like they were linking to fairly trivial bad things
4/21/19, 3:31 PM - Matt Casali: Ew gross
4/21/19, 3:31 PM - Matt Casali: Emooootttioooonnn???
4/21/19, 3:32 PM - Darren: And presumably the majority of students using this aren't well versed in evaluating the trustworthiness of websites
4/21/19, 3:33 PM - Alex Starr: Tho that’s a massively important skill that needs to be developed
4/21/19, 3:33 PM - Alex Starr: The inability to discern accurate info on the web is what gets us into climate change nationalist etc. messed
4/21/19, 3:33 PM - Matt Casali: To be clear I was saying emotion is gross, not the statement
4/21/19, 3:35 PM - Darren: This is a harsh comparison that doesn't completely match the scenario, but contemporary articles about luddites are focused about how emotional the luddites were, not comprehensive data about the situation
4/21/19, 3:35 PM - Darren: Absolutely. And this could help people learn that skill, but right now it likely isn't meant to so it doesn't
4/21/19, 3:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: The point was you need some better/more diverse metrics than happy or unhappy in evaluating if something is working in education, obviously
4/21/19, 3:36 PM - Matt Casali: Idk about you but I dont like being unhappy
4/21/19, 3:36 PM - Matt Casali: I would want that to change
4/21/19, 3:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’m not sure that’s what The NY Times article was trying to do, they could have just been taking the temperature on an issue
4/21/19, 3:38 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah I think so
4/21/19, 3:38 PM - Matt Casali: They still showed that it wasnt working
4/21/19, 3:40 PM - Darren: I did not get a sense for what percentage of students that used Summit hated it. What I got from the article was the understanding that students who aren't happy with it are really unhappy
4/21/19, 3:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: Sure I’m not making the claim that you should not try to make students happy. But as a metric by itself to measure effective education? It’s not very useful. Look at the Princeton review of happiest students. It has Virginia tech within 4 spots of Brown. Which would you rather send your kid to?
4/21/19, 3:41 PM - Darren: Maybe I skimmed to quickly. If the data is there, lmk
4/21/19, 3:41 PM - Matt Casali: The one where they're most happt
4/21/19, 3:42 PM - Matt Casali: *happy
4/21/19, 3:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: But would you use any other judgement or just pick Virginia Tech over Stanford because it didn’t even place in the top 10
4/21/19, 3:43 PM - Darren: I would have been really happy not learning anything in elementary school and just played the whole time
4/21/19, 3:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: Right it’s a dangerous level of hedonism is what I’m getting at
4/21/19, 3:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: Again, obviously
4/21/19, 3:45 PM - Matt Casali: Not me
4/21/19, 3:45 PM - Matt Casali: I really dont think you would have been either
4/21/19, 3:46 PM - Alex Starr: I’m also throwing this out there, there’s no context for students unhappy in the current system
4/21/19, 3:46 PM - Darren: I got that some amount of students (between 0 and 100%) who use Summit have more anxiety than those who don't. But I don't know what about summit makes them more anxious than their non mountain climbing peers. It would be really helpful to know why
4/21/19, 3:47 PM - Darren: I absolutely would have preferred not doing vocab books
4/21/19, 3:48 PM - Alex Starr: And who liked multiplication tables? Or those goddamn personal essays?
4/21/19, 3:49 PM - Darren: I liked some personal essays... Accidentally put my mom on probation from one of those
4/21/19, 3:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: You could tell students do whatever made them the most happy at any moment in time there you have some very happy children
4/21/19, 3:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: Whoops
4/21/19, 3:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: I would have never played soccer bc putting on my shin guards was hard
4/21/19, 3:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: Maybe they should have just let us just not wear them
4/21/19, 3:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: too many justs*
4/21/19, 3:52 PM - Darren: Dude fuck those ankle shin gaurds. I used those until sophomore year
4/21/19, 3:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lol the switch to the slips in was the best move of all time
4/21/19, 3:53 PM - Matt Casali: Ultimate freedom isnt happiness - people are more happy with a choice if there's a smaller pool to pick from
4/21/19, 3:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: In studies they’ve shown that
4/21/19, 3:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: But how does happiness overall mean that one of those choices was better for their education outcomes?
4/21/19, 3:55 PM - Matt Casali: Idk man
4/21/19, 3:55 PM - Matt Casali: I dont have all the answers
4/21/19, 3:55 PM - Matt Casali: Only half of them
4/21/19, 3:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: Well what do you think about understanding the context of happiness and using other measures to get at whether a program is educationally effective?
4/21/19, 3:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: In theory or in practice
4/21/19, 4:05 PM - Alex Starr: To be fair, this is really hard to measure.  Standardized tests tend to suck dick.
4/21/19, 4:06 PM - Alex Starr: But I cannot stress enough how awesome a self-paced system would be.  I missed a ton of school in high school, but I guarantee (outside of concussion) id have been much more eager to go in a more self-paced model
4/21/19, 4:07 PM - Matt Casali: We get it, you've got a big brain
4/21/19, 4:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: I agree the thing I’m arguing against is uni-dimensional measures
4/21/19, 4:08 PM - Alex Starr: That’s not my point
4/21/19, 4:09 PM - Alex Starr: On the upside they are always diagonalizable
4/21/19, 4:09 PM - Darren: I think what Jason and I are arguing is that there will almost always be trade-offs between happiness in the moment and future happiness. And maybe maximizing temporary happiness in students shouldn't be our Northstar metric
4/21/19, 4:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah it sounds awesome
4/21/19, 4:10 PM - Darren: (but it is still an important metric to consider)
4/21/19, 4:11 PM - Alex Starr: If ur into history, u can do more history etc. it’s like AP classes and ELL and everything in between and beyond all at once
4/21/19, 4:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: What does that mean?
4/21/19, 4:11 PM - Alex Starr: Nothing haha bad math joke
4/21/19, 4:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha ok
4/21/19, 4:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: Maybe if I’d had the option for self-driven learning in hs I’d understand
4/21/19, 4:13 PM - Alex Starr: Yup you might’ve discovered you love math
4/21/19, 4:13 PM - Darren: Case and point: I think I'd be a lot happier if I dropped my classes for the rest of the quarter and just worked on my own stuff. But that isn't what would maximize future happiness (and therefore net happiness)
4/21/19, 4:13 PM - Darren: A cruel mistress
4/21/19, 4:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: I think Matt knows that too I’m not sure if there’s something he isn’t saying
4/21/19, 4:15 PM - Matt Casali: https://www.reddit.com/r/GifRecipes/comments/7mn8o6/baked_mac_cheese/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share @Ricky
4/21/19, 4:17 PM - Matt Casali: "We get it, you've got a big brain"
4/21/19, 4:17 PM - Alex Starr: Matt I don’t have to be involved in the discussion if you don’t want me to
4/21/19, 4:18 PM - Darren: Extending that, we don't have to have this discussion if you don't want it
4/21/19, 4:18 PM - Matt Casali: No no I'm just trying to make bad jokes too
4/21/19, 4:19 PM - Matt Casali: I dont care if you guys have the discussion, I'm just not gonna be good at actively participating in it
4/21/19, 4:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: You see the incongruence of saying you dont care if we have a discussion when you post the article to the group and your thoughts on it, right?
4/21/19, 4:23 PM - Matt Casali: I get angry during these discussions and I dont know how to talk about it without confusing myself, so I just lash out against the person im arguing against
4/21/19, 4:23 PM - Matt Casali: In most cases that is captain utilitarianism
4/21/19, 4:23 PM - Alex Starr: Promotion sweet
4/21/19, 4:24 PM - Matt Casali: I'm saying you should have a discussion, I just get discouraged pretty early on
4/21/19, 4:24 PM - Darren: Damn, I need to start making better points. Alex has like a 70% attack rate and I got none
4/21/19, 4:24 PM - Alex Starr: Haha
4/21/19, 4:25 PM - Darren: But in this particular discussion, everyone seemingly agrees except for matt. So if matt and his argument leave, it just becomes a circle jerk
4/21/19, 4:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah it’s hard not too, because your first inclination is fuck this guy I’m right. It’s not easy to discuss stuff productively but it’s a skill worth investing in if you want to figure truth out for yourself because most of the time you have to listen and hear people out. That goes for people listening to you too
4/21/19, 4:26 PM - Matt Casali: It wasnt already?
4/21/19, 4:26 PM - Matt Casali: Damn
4/21/19, 4:26 PM - Matt Casali: Listening is easy
4/21/19, 4:26 PM - Matt Casali: I dont like reading conversations
4/21/19, 4:27 PM - Matt Casali: A story would be nice
4/21/19, 4:27 PM - Parker: Lol
4/21/19, 4:27 PM - Matt Casali: Get some character arcs going
4/21/19, 4:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: Look we don’t have to talk about this  now maybe another time
4/21/19, 4:27 PM - Matt Casali: In person
4/21/19, 4:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Sure
4/21/19, 4:28 PM - Darren: You don't win those either...
4/21/19, 4:28 PM - Matt Casali: But I enjoy them a lot more
4/21/19, 4:28 PM - Matt Casali: When collin fucking destroyed me in smash I sure as hell didnt win, but I recovered
4/21/19, 4:28 PM - Matt Casali: If I played online and lost that badly, that many times, I may have never played smash again
4/21/19, 4:29 PM - Darren: You napped for 2 hours and then bitched about napping
4/21/19, 4:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha
4/21/19, 4:29 PM - Matt Casali: But
4/21/19, 4:29 PM - Matt Casali: I recovered
4/21/19, 4:29 PM - Matt Casali: It took a lot of weed
4/21/19, 4:29 PM - Matt Casali: But I did it
4/21/19, 4:29 PM - Darren: If Collin had beat you that many times online in a row, would you have quit smash forever?
4/21/19, 4:30 PM - Matt Casali: Yes?
4/21/19, 4:30 PM - Matt Casali: I think so
4/21/19, 4:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah we can talk whenever, the real point is Alex and Darren are salty bc they suck at new smash
4/21/19, 4:30 PM - Matt Casali: And kirby gang
4/21/19, 4:30 PM - Matt Casali: I've been using kirby more
4/21/19, 4:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: Kirby GANG
4/21/19, 4:30 PM - Matt Casali: He just got buffed
4/21/19, 4:30 PM - Matt Casali: Hes out to kill
4/21/19, 4:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hey if you can’t beat the hammer be the hammer
4/21/19, 4:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh fuck
4/21/19, 4:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: You’re joking
4/21/19, 4:33 PM - Matt Casali: No he did
4/21/19, 4:33 PM - Matt Casali: Look it up 3.0.0 changes mayne
4/21/19, 4:34 PM - Matt Casali: Less landing lag
4/21/19, 4:34 PM - Matt Casali: Hes fast as fuck
4/21/19, 4:34 PM - Parker: made my day
4/21/19, 4:34 PM - Parker: faxx
4/21/19, 4:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: W00Oow
4/21/19, 5:35 PM - Parker: damn tim that laureano hr rob was insane
4/21/19, 5:35 PM - Parker: then he airmailed everybody from the warning track lol
4/21/19, 6:01 PM - Alex Starr: Hey Matt (and everyone) I’d like to know, what is frustrating about having a discussion with me? Purely out of my interest/desire to be less frustrating.
4/21/19, 6:02 PM - Darren: If you could stop being so right all the time, that'd be great
4/21/19, 6:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: I used to get really annoyed with you because I thought you never made concessions and arguments were about some people winning and losing
4/21/19, 6:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: And losing sucked
4/21/19, 6:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: I don’t feel that way now tho
4/21/19, 6:15 PM - Matt Casali: You're very locked in
4/21/19, 6:15 PM - Matt Casali: You make concessions
4/21/19, 6:15 PM - Matt Casali: But they're concessions to my concessions
4/21/19, 6:18 PM - Matt Casali: I like to talk to you, and I love when you talk about baking. It's interesting to me
4/21/19, 6:18 PM - Matt Casali: But theres somethings that are hard to talk about with you and I'd rather not do it
4/21/19, 6:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: Also for the record I straight up really enjoy talking to you
4/21/19, 6:25 PM - Darren: The record so shows
4/21/19, 6:33 PM - Alex Starr: That’s fair.  Not sure what’s actionable though except to really acknowledge when I’m wrong
4/21/19, 6:35 PM - Matt Casali: Honestly, it's the setting more than anything
4/21/19, 6:36 PM - Darren: You _really_ dislike online correspondence
4/21/19, 6:36 PM - Matt Casali: I almost never get this when I'm talking to you in person
4/21/19, 6:36 PM - Matt Casali: I do indeed
4/21/19, 6:36 PM - Matt Casali: Talking is better
4/21/19, 6:36 PM - Alex Starr: I’m less of a dick in person
4/21/19, 6:37 PM - Alex Starr: For those kinds of discussions, I think online is better because it facilitates impartiality but I can see it both ways
4/21/19, 7:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: You can paraphrase the other persons point more or make a realistic argument for why they might think that way
4/21/19, 7:23 PM - Alex Starr: I suppose I could, when people do that with me it feels patronizing, but i don’t think that’s true generally
4/21/19, 7:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: Right
4/21/19, 7:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: If someone leaves feeling like you made them look stupid you might not get as far as you could if they were not more willing because they felt understood
4/21/19, 7:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: I have a big problem with doing right tho I’ll admit
4/21/19, 7:37 PM - Alex Starr: It is hard to do right
4/21/19, 7:37 PM - Alex Starr: Also Matt I’m more than happy to talk at length about baking lol
4/21/19, 7:39 PM - Alex Starr: I just didn’t think the audience was there
4/21/19, 7:44 PM - Matt Casali: I am
4/21/19, 7:44 PM - Matt Casali: I love to eat
4/21/19, 7:44 PM - Matt Casali: And everything that has to do with it
4/21/19, 8:29 PM - Parker: Tf i love baking alex
4/22/19, 1:11 AM - Tim Ko: Yeeee
4/22/19, 1:11 AM - Tim Ko: Ikr he just chucked it 😂
4/24/19, 2:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: Stoked to hang with everyone is this sum
4/24/19, 2:50 PM - Matt Casali: Me too
4/24/19, 2:50 PM - Matt Casali: Hopefully we can get some fun trips planned
4/24/19, 2:56 PM - Alex Starr: To Berkeley the happiest place in Berkeley
4/24/19, 2:57 PM - Darren: Not likely
4/24/19, 2:58 PM - Alex Starr: Well I’ll be there for damn near all of it
4/24/19, 2:58 PM - Alex Starr: As I probably should’ve been last year
4/24/19, 2:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: We will make a hard appearance
4/24/19, 2:59 PM - Alex Starr: What hahaha
4/24/19, 3:00 PM - Darren: I'm with you to the end of the line
4/24/19, 3:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: Take a few photos so people know we were there and then vomit in your sink for good measure
4/24/19, 3:01 PM - Alex Starr: we don’t have a disposal that’d be awful
4/24/19, 3:02 PM - Jason Greenberg: It can always be scooped into a toilet later with a solo cup
4/24/19, 3:03 PM - Alex Starr: Piss into it instead
4/24/19, 3:03 PM - Darren: That's the Berkeley way
4/24/19, 3:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
4/24/19, 3:05 PM - Alex Starr: Or at least the local chapter of planned parenthood’s
4/24/19, 3:05 PM - Darren: That's _my_ Berkeley way
4/24/19, 3:47 PM - Parker: hahaha
4/24/19, 5:47 PM - Collin Hurst: We can make a new stain
4/24/19, 5:48 PM - Darren: Bring Anthony

4/25/19, 2:19 PM - Parker: <Media omitted>
4/25/19, 2:22 PM - Collin Hurst: a lot of unnecessary metrics
4/25/19, 2:25 PM - Tim Ko: Lmao
4/25/19, 5:01 PM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
4/25/19, 5:01 PM - Collin Hurst: Why did I get this email?
4/25/19, 5:01 PM - Collin Hurst: It says it's to some random other Gmail
4/25/19, 5:01 PM - Parker: Wtf lol
4/25/19, 5:01 PM - Darren: Someone is phising
4/25/19, 5:01 PM - Collin Hurst: And I'm also not qualified for a "senior purchasing agent"
4/25/19, 5:02 PM - Collin Hurst: How
4/25/19, 5:21 PM - Ricky: ^
4/25/19, 5:22 PM - Ricky: They do this to all chapman students as a test, they send out an email like this and if u click on the link chapman goes “ya fucked up and might have allowed our system to be attacked, be better
4/25/19, 5:22 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lmaoo
4/25/19, 5:26 PM - Collin Hurst: This isn't a link tho it just says send your resume to the email below
4/25/19, 5:27 PM - Darren: Knowing whether you'll be responsive to random shit in your inbox is valuable to a lot of scammers
4/25/19, 5:31 PM - Collin Hurst: Hm makes sense
4/25/19, 5:33 PM - Tim Ko: Hahaha
4/25/19, 5:33 PM - Tim Ko: Collin wato u respond
4/25/19, 5:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: Collin if you need more reasons, like look at how funny Tim thinks it would be if you respond
4/25/19, 5:34 PM - Ricky: ^
4/25/19, 5:35 PM - Jason Greenberg: That’s a good gauge of where you life is headed: How funny does Tim think it would be for you to do it
4/25/19, 5:35 PM - Darren: 1 in 1 his ass
4/25/19, 5:35 PM - Ricky: The true test to a bad idea
4/25/19, 5:35 PM - Ricky: Looool
4/25/19, 5:35 PM - Ricky: Offer them to get ur ass slammed
4/25/19, 5:35 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha gotta respect the rule of 1 in 1

4/25/19, 8:42 PM - Darren: Someone from the future
4/25/19, 8:42 PM - Matt Casali: Me, it's a reminder I set
4/25/19, 8:42 PM - Alex Starr: And why does it look like they died mid message
4/25/19, 8:42 PM - Matt Casali: Though I cant remember what the story was about
4/25/19, 8:42 PM - Matt Casali: I'm sorry ricky
4/25/19, 8:43 PM - Collin Hurst: Well you have 19 years to remember
4/25/19, 8:43 PM - Matt Casali: I'll do my research
4/25/19, 8:43 PM - Alex Starr: Why’s it say g...
4/25/19, 8:44 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
4/25/19, 8:44 PM - Alex Starr: Thank you
4/25/19, 8:44 PM - Matt Casali: Haha you're welcome
4/25/19, 8:45 PM - Matt Casali: It still doesnt clear anything up for me haha
4/25/19, 8:56 PM - Alex Starr: But at least I have all the pieces of the puzzle
4/25/19, 9:12 PM - Ricky: YOOOO
4/25/19, 9:13 PM - Ricky: i vaguely setting that on ur phone
4/25/19, 9:13 PM - Darren: Story time
4/25/19, 9:17 PM - Matt Casali: I think its cause we were really high in Tahoe (?) and you were trying to tell me a story and accusing me of not paying attention to you
4/25/19, 9:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: Damn I just major deju vu back to when we used to talk about chat etiquette
4/25/19, 9:38 PM - Ricky: Ahahathat sounds about right
4/25/19, 9:38 PM - Vaughn: During your triathlon?
4/25/19, 9:38 PM - Ricky: Haha why?
4/25/19, 9:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: Dunno
4/25/19, 9:56 PM - Alex Starr: I always flashback to “Alex and Darren are good people” whenever I hear chat etiquette or something similar
4/25/19, 9:57 PM - Darren: Big if true
4/25/19, 9:57 PM - Vaughn: Hahahaha
4/25/19, 9:58 PM - Matt Casali: I wasnt wrong
4/25/19, 10:03 PM - Alex Starr: Maybe 1/2
4/25/19, 10:04 PM - Darren: Aw thanks
4/25/19, 10:06 PM - Alex Starr: No problem
4/26/19, 4:44 PM - Tim Ko: Apparently there was a shooting at people park an hour ago
4/26/19, 4:44 PM - Tim Ko: One guy got a head wound and was rushed to the hospital
4/26/19, 4:44 PM - Tim Ko: Shooter got away
4/26/19, 4:44 PM - Darren: Aya
4/26/19, 4:53 PM - Parker: jesus
4/26/19, 4:55 PM - Alex Starr: No he’s okay I think
4/26/19, 5:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: How close is that to you guys?
4/26/19, 5:20 PM - Alex Starr: 1/4 mile?
4/26/19, 5:20 PM - Alex Starr: Why?
4/26/19, 5:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: To get a sense of what that meant
4/26/19, 5:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: I know v little of Berkeley things
4/26/19, 5:21 PM - Alex Starr: Oh doesn’t mean anything haha
4/26/19, 5:21 PM - Alex Starr: Tho haha could be rude
4/26/19, 5:22 PM - Jason Greenberg: To Tim
4/26/19, 5:23 PM - Alex Starr: I’m confused
4/26/19, 5:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: Well Tim seemed concerned
4/26/19, 5:24 PM - Alex Starr: Oh I doubt very much that he’s concerned
4/26/19, 5:25 PM - Tim Ko: It’s down the street two blocks from us
4/26/19, 5:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: Jeez
4/26/19, 5:26 PM - Alex Starr: Tim r u concerned?
4/26/19, 5:26 PM - Alex Starr: I could ask in person I suppose but I don’t have a follow up
4/26/19, 5:28 PM - Tim Ko: I mean the shooter got away lol
4/26/19, 5:29 PM - Tim Ko: I’d say a little at least
4/26/19, 5:38 PM - Alex Starr: Oh I concede.  Was confused cuz you left the door open haha
4/26/19, 5:42 PM - Ricky: Damn, tell him how u really fee
4/26/19, 7:52 PM - Parker: this doesn’t change the fact that there was shooter down the street..
4/26/19, 8:10 PM - Vaughn: We in the endgame now boys!!!
4/26/19, 8:12 PM - Alex Starr: I want to know nothing
4/26/19, 8:13 PM - Darren: You could come watch it with us, Alex
4/26/19, 8:14 PM - Darren: Although last minute plans don't usually work, so it's fine if you can't make it
4/26/19, 8:15 PM - Collin Hurst: Say anything else and I'll put my boot so far up your dickhole you'll taste the last bit of grass the cow had before it got turned into leather
4/26/19, 8:17 PM - Alex Starr: My dad wants me to wait to see it with family
4/26/19, 10:06 PM - Parker: i feel for endgame after a couple days it’s on you if it gets spoiled
4/26/19, 10:06 PM - Alex Starr: Fuck no
4/26/19, 10:07 PM - Alex Starr: 3 weeks
4/26/19, 10:19 PM - Darren: ^
4/27/19, 3:06 AM - Vaughn: Just got back from Endgame
4/27/19, 3:06 AM - Vaughn: It was a movie
4/27/19, 3:06 AM - Darren: Shut up
4/27/19, 3:06 AM - Vaughn: And I watched it
4/27/19, 3:06 AM - Vaughn: That is all
4/27/19, 3:06 AM - Darren: You're an ass
4/27/19, 3:07 AM - Vaughn: ❤
4/27/19, 3:07 AM - Darren: As per my previous message, fuck off
4/27/19, 8:09 AM - Ricky: Lol, my roommates and his girlfriend watched it yesterday morning and they doing the same thing
4/27/19, 8:14 AM - Alex Starr: I really feel like fuck off handles all of this well

5/7/19, 8:14 PM - Alex Starr: That’s pretty similar to what the professor I met with Monday at Stanford studies
5/7/19, 8:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: Distributed knowledge networks?
5/7/19, 8:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: Better question might be what does he study?
5/7/19, 8:38 PM - Alex Starr: Nothing that specific but how the brain computes
5/7/19, 8:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh that’s dope
5/7/19, 8:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: I think understanding that stuff deeper and deeper makes learning more enjoyable if you think about yourself as this efficiency machine
5/7/19, 8:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: Feels powerful
5/7/19, 8:40 PM - Alex Starr: Except we have no idea how we represent things or learn
5/7/19, 8:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: information efficiency machine*
5/7/19, 8:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: No but we have models
5/7/19, 8:40 PM - Alex Starr: That may or may not be accurate
5/7/19, 8:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: True but they’re fun to think about if buy into them
5/7/19, 8:41 PM - Alex Starr: Yes
5/7/19, 8:41 PM - Alex Starr: And the goal of this lab is to figure out what the accurate models are
5/7/19, 8:42 PM - Alex Starr: But it’s pretty goddamn intractable so we will see haha.  We finally have enough data to start to really try to figure it out though
5/7/19, 8:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: Our textbook makes it seem like it’s super hard to disprove a lot of them
5/7/19, 8:44 PM - Alex Starr: They seem to (from the labs papers) do a decent job of ruling out a lot but that leaves quite a few in there
5/7/19, 8:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: What lab is it?
5/7/19, 8:45 PM - Alex Starr: Druckmann lab
5/7/19, 8:45 PM - Alex Starr: It’s pretty mathy
5/7/19, 8:46 PM - Alex Starr: Lots of dynamical systems (tho not very in depth) and linear algebra
5/7/19, 9:20 PM - Matt Casali: Astrology
5/7/19, 9:24 PM - Alex Starr: Not even remotely the same situation
5/7/19, 9:28 PM - Matt Casali: Says you!
5/7/19, 9:29 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah
5/7/19, 9:29 PM - Alex Starr: And by definition I am correct
5/7/19, 9:31 PM - Collin Hurst: Matt's never had takis
5/7/19, 9:31 PM - Matt Casali: You're right
5/7/19, 9:31 PM - Matt Casali: My opinion is invalid and unimportant
5/7/19, 9:31 PM - Matt Casali: And I fully and unconditionally accept this
5/7/19, 9:32 PM - Matt Casali: Until I eat takis
5/7/19, 9:37 PM - Collin Hurst: Yes
5/7/19, 10:09 PM - Parker: what
5/7/19, 10:09 PM - Parker: how is that possible
5/7/19, 10:11 PM - Collin Hurst: I have no idea
5/7/19, 10:34 PM - Ricky: It’s cuz he too focused on his hot Cheetos, nothing else can quench his hunger better than the dirty cheetz
5/7/19, 10:34 PM - Collin Hurst: The hot cheeeeez boi too distracting
5/7/19, 10:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lmaoo
5/7/19, 10:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: If you know you know
5/8/19, 10:58 PM - Collin Hurst: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOz_NEr0aeY
5/8/19, 11:15 PM - Parker: hahahah wtf is that
5/8/19, 11:55 PM - Vaughn: Thats the most rediculous video ive ever seen my lord haha
5/8/19, 11:56 PM - Collin Hurst: i wanna do that
5/8/19, 11:56 PM - Collin Hurst: the cheese better be good
5/9/19, 12:45 AM - Ricky: Yessss that’s that midnight YouTube find we needed
5/9/19, 2:44 AM - Tim Ko: https://streamable.com/6dc7f
5/9/19, 2:44 AM - Tim Ko: Check this out
5/9/19, 2:45 AM - Collin Hurst: gonna be a ball tho
5/9/19, 2:45 AM - Collin Hurst: lol
5/9/19, 2:51 AM - Ricky: Damn that’s impressive
5/9/19, 2:52 AM - Ricky: That walk off homerun tonight though
5/9/19, 2:52 AM - Ricky: Gang gang 510
5/9/19, 2:52 AM - Ricky: MATT OLSEN IS BACK AND THE A’s are better then ever, just need KD back on the field
5/9/19, 7:19 AM - Vaughn: TIL Hans Zimmer composed parts of the Modern Warfare 2 soundtrack
5/9/19, 7:19 AM - Vaughn: Greatest game ever
5/9/19, 7:19 AM - Vaughn: Explains so much
5/9/19, 11:18 AM - Tim Ko: GANG
5/9/19, 11:25 AM - Matt Casali: https://youtu.be/p7ruBotHWUs
Saw this in class today
5/9/19, 12:03 PM - Ricky: Looooool
5/9/19, 12:03 PM - Ricky: I can’t watch cuz studying for final
5/9/19, 12:03 PM - Ricky: But will watch at work tonight for sure
5/9/19, 12:04 PM - Ricky: Love that show, love the title
5/9/19, 12:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yo Alex we had a good discussion in the climbing chat
5/9/19, 12:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: Unrelated to climbing
5/9/19, 12:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: Can we add you?
5/9/19, 12:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: And anyone else who’d like to be in on it
5/9/19, 2:27 PM - Alex Starr: Sure tho I won’t be able to view what was said
5/9/19, 2:30 PM - Alex Starr: What’s the gist?
5/9/19, 2:37 PM - Matt Casali: Soooo basically Ricky doesnt believe I can love anyone
5/9/19, 2:40 PM - Alex Starr: How’d that come up?
5/9/19, 2:41 PM - Matt Casali: Haha I'm joking
5/9/19, 2:43 PM - Alex Starr: I figured but was it at least tangentially related?
5/9/19, 2:45 PM - Darren: I sense a trap
5/9/19, 2:46 PM - Alex Starr: Eh I have a good feeling about it
5/9/19, 2:48 PM - Parker: its not a trap
5/9/19, 2:49 PM - Darren: That's what someone would say if they were trying to get someone to fall into said trap
5/9/19, 2:50 PM - Parker: you got me
5/9/19, 2:52 PM - Matt Casali: You could join our minecraft chat instead for more fiery convos
5/9/19, 2:54 PM - Alex Starr: So no one is gonna lmk the gist?
5/9/19, 2:55 PM - Matt Casali: I'm not really sure what it is
5/9/19, 2:56 PM - Matt Casali: And I think I'm gonna give a biased point of view and I dont really wanna get into it again haha
5/9/19, 2:59 PM - Alex Starr: I’m confident I can denoise your answer
5/9/19, 3:00 PM - Parker: Gist is kinda hard
5/9/19, 3:00 PM - Alex Starr: How about the gestalt
5/9/19, 3:00 PM - Alex Starr: Or a lengthy summary
5/9/19, 3:00 PM - Alex Starr: Or any information
5/9/19, 3:02 PM - Matt Casali: We were talking about how the documentary free solo depicted Alex honnolds relationship with his girlfriend and I was saying that it was emotionally abusive
5/9/19, 3:02 PM - Matt Casali: That's what started the convo
5/9/19, 3:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Like not even though that’s the thing
5/9/19, 3:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
5/9/19, 3:10 PM - Vaughn: Someone can send you the log if you wish alex
5/9/19, 3:11 PM - Alex Starr: Sure why not
5/9/19, 3:11 PM - Alex Starr: Give me an excuse to dodge finals prep
5/9/19, 3:11 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
5/9/19, 3:11 PM - Ricky: If u want an excuse
5/9/19, 3:11 PM - Ricky: Watch free solo
5/9/19, 3:12 PM - Parker: Lol
5/9/19, 3:12 PM - Parker: wait i screen recorded it
5/9/19, 3:12 PM - Parker: you impatient fooks
5/9/19, 3:12 PM - Parker: it took awhile so i didn’t do all of it
5/9/19, 3:12 PM - Parker: BIG FILE INCOMING
5/9/19, 3:13 PM - Alex Starr: It was a trap
5/9/19, 3:13 PM - Ricky: It’s honestly p interesting
5/9/19, 3:13 PM - Ricky: Like, there is a reason why millions of non climbers have seen it
5/9/19, 3:14 PM - Ricky: Dawn wall is much more climbing and u prob wouldn’t like
5/9/19, 3:14 PM - Alex Starr: Death threats?
5/9/19, 3:14 PM - Ricky: Ah, ya got me
5/9/19, 3:14 PM - Parker: <Media omitted>
5/9/19, 3:16 PM - Parker: ^
5/9/19, 3:20 PM - Vaughn: Damn you clever bitch parker
5/9/19, 3:20 PM - Ricky: Thnx pman
5/9/19, 3:20 PM - Ricky: Hopefully Alex reading rn
5/9/19, 3:21 PM - Alex Starr: Thank you
5/9/19, 3:21 PM - Alex Starr: It got fast af in bits lol
5/9/19, 3:21 PM - Darren: That was kinda funny
5/9/19, 3:22 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha GET THE LOG
5/9/19, 3:22 PM - Ricky: Those parts were nonsense about r and stuff
5/9/19, 3:22 PM - Ricky: Collin fingering Karissa, u know
5/9/19, 3:22 PM - Darren: "we still love Alex"
5/9/19, 3:23 PM - Alex Starr: _And_ I’m a good person
5/9/19, 3:23 PM - Ricky: <Media omitted>
5/9/19, 3:23 PM - Alex Starr: I think you may be confused as to why I appreciate it haha
5/9/19, 3:23 PM - Ricky: Eh, I’m not worried, just glad you aren’t offended
5/9/19, 3:23 PM - Ricky: And if you are, also okay
5/9/19, 3:23 PM - Ricky: Wasn’t meant for your eyes
5/9/19, 3:23 PM - Ricky: Which I guess makes it worse
5/9/19, 3:23 PM - Alex Starr: It would
5/9/19, 3:25 PM - Alex Starr: I was initially offended, then said eh he has a point plus ur follow up kinda contradicted the statement cuz I liked the bit about there being people who show affection in different ways
5/9/19, 3:26 PM - Darren: I like the immediate lash out by matt
5/9/19, 3:27 PM - Ricky: I think that was fueled by the moment
5/9/19, 3:27 PM - Alex Starr: Fairly stock standard of late
5/9/19, 3:27 PM - Darren: ^
5/9/19, 3:27 PM - Ricky: I feel like if I put the two messages together I woulda been more clear
5/9/19, 3:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: True
5/9/19, 3:27 PM - Ricky: So I am partially to blame for sure
5/9/19, 3:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: Eh
5/9/19, 3:28 PM - Ricky: Once again, I have no problem with how matt responded
5/9/19, 3:28 PM - Ricky: It was how he felt
5/9/19, 3:28 PM - Ricky: That’s good enough for me
5/9/19, 3:28 PM - Alex Starr: R u tho?
5/9/19, 3:28 PM - Darren: That's very cute of you, Ricky
5/9/19, 3:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: ^
5/9/19, 3:28 PM - Ricky: Thanks, but also slowly my pholosophy on things
5/9/19, 3:29 PM - Matt Casali: That deserves a fuck you
5/9/19, 3:29 PM - Alex Starr: An unintentional trap on my part
5/9/19, 3:31 PM - Parker: Hahaha sorry i aired on the side of slower at the start but then it was taking too long lol but some of it was also nonsense not relevant to the discussion
5/9/19, 3:31 PM - Parker: aaaamd we’re back to square one
5/9/19, 3:36 PM - Matt Casali: Haha I was half joking
5/9/19, 3:37 PM - Parker: I know i know
5/9/19, 3:37 PM - Parker: i was full joking
5/9/19, 3:37 PM - Matt Casali: But tbh I'm airing on the side of just not wanting to participate in some of these discussions
5/9/19, 3:37 PM - Matt Casali: Its tiring af
5/9/19, 3:37 PM - Darren: We have noticed
5/9/19, 3:37 PM - Alex Starr: I hate saying this but perspective is important
5/9/19, 3:37 PM - Alex Starr: None of this is all that significant
5/9/19, 3:39 PM - Darren: Well, yeah
5/9/19, 3:39 PM - Matt Casali: Hahaha ^
5/9/19, 3:39 PM - Alex Starr: So why be emotionally invested?
5/9/19, 3:40 PM - Matt Casali: Cause why the hell not?
5/9/19, 3:41 PM - Alex Starr: Well if it’s making you unhappy to the point you want to avoid us...
5/9/19, 3:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: I will say it was tiring for me to get to a place where I enjoy talking about this kinda stuff
5/9/19, 3:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: Look at all the fighting I did with Alex for like 2 years on here
5/9/19, 3:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: That was uncomfortable
5/9/19, 3:43 PM - Alex Starr: Even I was vaguely uncomfortable during that
5/9/19, 3:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah I fought dirty
5/9/19, 3:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’m glad you maybe don’t hate me for it
5/9/19, 3:47 PM - Ricky: Haha, well I resent both of you for it 🙃
5/9/19, 3:47 PM - Parker: ^
5/9/19, 3:47 PM - Parker: yeah fuck you guys
5/9/19, 3:47 PM - Alex Starr: Definitely not
5/9/19, 3:48 PM - Darren: He doesn't hate you because of _that_
5/9/19, 3:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: Nice we should have a hate circle
5/9/19, 3:49 PM - Alex Starr: That would be a really fun bad idea
5/9/19, 3:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: I totally agree with the fun part
5/9/19, 3:50 PM - Alex Starr: Oh I’m down
5/9/19, 3:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: The loser of the hate circle (and there will be a loser) has to spend the night in a dog crate
5/9/19, 3:52 PM - Darren: Sorry @16505758873
5/9/19, 3:53 PM - Alex Starr: He’s in the crate for sure
5/9/19, 3:54 PM - Matt Casali: But sacrificing views is gonna make me more unhappy
5/9/19, 3:55 PM - Alex Starr: You don’t have to sacrifice it; just don’t have to be so emotionally invested in the outcome
5/9/19, 3:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah that’s a good point
5/9/19, 3:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: Be invested in the winning hand not the one you come in with
5/9/19, 3:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: Naw that analogy makes it a competition
5/9/19, 3:57 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah I was gonna say
5/9/19, 3:57 PM - Matt Casali: I just dont have fun expressing myself
5/9/19, 3:57 PM - Matt Casali: Cause I feel attacked
5/9/19, 3:58 PM - Matt Casali: And THEN I get emotional
5/9/19, 3:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: I could see how’d you feel that way if you feel like your views express who you are, not where you are in your understanding about an issue
5/9/19, 4:00 PM - Parker: don’t try me
5/9/19, 4:00 PM - Alex Starr: Just play the hand your dealt to the best of your ability
5/9/19, 4:02 PM - Matt Casali: They 100% express who I am
5/9/19, 4:03 PM - Matt Casali: Just as much as my hobbies or anything else
5/9/19, 4:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: That’s more complicated
5/9/19, 4:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: Because there are different camps
5/9/19, 4:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: You can view yourself and product of your choices, or as the circumstances that created those “choices” or fall somewhere on a spectrum
5/9/19, 4:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: But where you are could increase your sense of ownership over those ideas that you have
5/9/19, 4:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: Because where did they come from and how much choice did you have in acquiring them?
5/9/19, 4:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: If it’s all you then you own those ideas
5/9/19, 4:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: And conversely if it’s not all you finding those stances then you would feel might not feel like they’re integral to who you are
5/9/19, 4:09 PM - Matt Casali: I see that
5/9/19, 4:09 PM - Matt Casali: But I dont
5/9/19, 4:09 PM - Matt Casali: And I cant really talk about this right now
5/9/19, 4:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah no worries
5/9/19, 4:16 PM - Alex Starr: On another note I’ve had a weirdly good set of news this week but due to strange circumstance can’t benefit from a lot of it
5/9/19, 4:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: What’s up
5/9/19, 4:16 PM - Alex Starr: Met with a Stanford professor, he does awesome research and seemed legitimately interested in having me as a grad student but that doesn’t help me get in
5/9/19, 4:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh how so?
5/9/19, 4:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: That is dope tho
5/9/19, 4:17 PM - Alex Starr: Got an email from a professor at Berkeley who I interview with asking to meet about doing research in his lab over the summer, but I thought the interview went terribly plus it had been a while so I’ve already made other commitments and had to awkwardly decline
5/9/19, 4:18 PM - Alex Starr: Then in purely good news, I am going to get mildly payed this summer for research
5/9/19, 4:18 PM - Matt Casali: That's pretty damn cool!
5/9/19, 4:18 PM - Alex Starr: You apply to the program not a particular lab unfortunately
5/9/19, 4:19 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah it’s minimum wage for 10 hours a week but it’s nice cuz I’d do it anyway
5/9/19, 4:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: Aw that’s a downside
5/9/19, 4:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: Would he be able to advocate for you in some ideal scenario?
5/9/19, 4:21 PM - Alex Starr: I’m gonna hope so/ let him know when I apply and email him a month after
5/9/19, 4:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: Awesome
5/9/19, 4:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: And when are you starting applications?
5/9/19, 4:44 PM - Alex Starr: 2 weeks
5/9/19, 4:44 PM - Alex Starr: They are due November
5/9/19, 4:45 PM - Alex Starr: I’m trying not to think about it constantly and really doing a piss poor job
5/9/19, 4:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: Understandably
5/9/19, 4:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: Cuz that’s the big ticket rn right?
5/9/19, 4:50 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah most everything else (school related) means fuck all
5/9/19, 4:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah I can relate
5/9/19, 4:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: The class I’m in now is basically a here’s what you could do in graduate school but you’re still in college class with every topic
5/9/19, 5:03 PM - Alex Starr: How med schooly is your grad school?
5/9/19, 5:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: Depends on what that means?
5/9/19, 5:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: I guess I don’t really know what med school looks like
5/9/19, 5:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: I will say unrelated but related my top choice school is PGSP- Stanford Consortium that where half the professors are Stanford people
5/9/19, 5:16 PM - Alex Starr: Stanford is awesome
5/9/19, 5:16 PM - Alex Starr: Do u mostly do classes plus clinical or mostly research?
5/9/19, 5:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh classes plus heavy clinical, if I’m lucky only one year of a “research project”
5/9/19, 5:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: PsyD is more hands on which is why I want to do it over PhD
5/9/19, 5:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: What’s med school?
5/9/19, 5:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: In that framework
5/9/19, 5:33 PM - Alex Starr: All classes all the time
5/9/19, 5:34 PM - Alex Starr: Until you intern and do vaguely doctory stuff
5/9/19, 5:34 PM - Alex Starr: PhD is heavy research, light classes
5/9/19, 5:36 PM - Ricky: Just finished my biostats final
5/9/19, 5:36 PM - Ricky: No idea how I did
5/9/19, 5:36 PM - Ricky: But feel good about answering every question
5/9/19, 5:40 PM - Alex Starr: Nice!
5/9/19, 5:40 PM - Alex Starr: How mathy was the exam?
5/9/19, 5:41 PM - Alex Starr: Like is it computational or proofy or more conceptual ?
5/9/19, 6:14 PM - Collin Hurst: Good shit Alex!
5/9/19, 6:14 PM - Alex Starr: Thanks
5/9/19, 8:17 PM - Ricky: Both?
5/9/19, 8:17 PM - Ricky: All three
5/9/19, 8:17 PM - Ricky: Sorry been at work
5/9/19, 8:19 PM - Alex Starr: Proofs? Damn intense
5/9/19, 8:31 PM - Ricky: Not proofs lol
5/9/19, 8:31 PM - Ricky: More like hypothesis testing
5/9/19, 8:31 PM - Alex Starr: Oh okay
5/9/19, 8:32 PM - Alex Starr: You probably know a hell of a lot more about biostatistics than I do
5/9/19, 8:35 PM - Alex Starr: Did u like the class?
5/9/19, 9:26 PM - Parker: i’m doing hypothesis testing too gang
5/9/19, 9:26 PM - Parker: confidence intervals
5/9/19, 10:29 PM - Collin Hurst: season 7 of new girl is out eskitit
5/9/19, 10:30 PM - Alex Starr: It was awful
5/9/19, 10:30 PM - Collin Hurst: aw
5/9/19, 10:30 PM - Matt Casali: yeah its not very good
5/9/19, 10:30 PM - Matt Casali: sorry bud haha
5/9/19, 10:30 PM - Collin Hurst: pp nigget

5/11/19, 7:48 PM - Parker: 1-0 baby
5/11/19, 7:48 PM - Collin Hurst: I'll suck a dudes nut if they win
5/11/19, 7:49 PM - Vaughn: Damn you must really want to suck a dudes nut
5/11/19, 7:49 PM - Ricky: Can I get this notarized and signed by the end of the game?
5/11/19, 7:49 PM - Vaughn: Its pretty much over collin thats kinda weird to say
5/11/19, 7:52 PM - Parker: That’s basically just saying you’ll suck a dudes but
5/11/19, 7:52 PM - Parker: nut
5/11/19, 7:53 PM - Alex Starr: Pretty sure all WhatsApp communiques are binding
5/11/19, 7:54 PM - Collin Hurst: THEY
5/11/19, 7:55 PM - Ricky: You didn’t specify they
5/11/19, 7:55 PM - Collin Hurst: I would've said we
5/11/19, 7:56 PM - Collin Hurst: If it was the sharks
5/11/19, 7:56 PM - Collin Hurst: Cause we are a family
5/11/19, 7:56 PM - Parker: Ohh true
5/11/19, 7:56 PM - Alex Starr: Weird that ur going to suck someone’s nut then
5/11/19, 7:58 PM - Ricky: Sounds like you were being purposefully ambiguous so u could suck a bit

5/12/19, 6:34 PM - Darren: Apparently, the CIA lifted half of a Soviet submarine off the ocean floor during the  cold war by using a giant crane on a boat - without the soviets detecting it. When records of their submarine heist  got leaked to the press, the CIA coined the phrase "I can neither confirm nor deny" as their official response to journalists.

5/15/19, 10:19 PM - Alex Starr: I can’t argue with that
5/15/19, 10:19 PM - Jason Greenberg: Maybe. That could also be a self-fulfilling prophecy right there
5/15/19, 10:19 PM - Tim Ko: Oooo I learned that in my soc class
5/15/19, 10:20 PM - Tim Ko: Pretty cool concept
5/15/19, 10:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: I agree
5/15/19, 10:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: What example did they give you?
5/15/19, 10:22 PM - Tim Ko: I forgot, lemme check my slides lol
5/15/19, 10:22 PM - Alex Starr: Exactly.  Ur only gonna be right if you make yourself right

5/15/19, 10:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: I thought you were flipping it on me?
5/15/19, 10:25 PM - Tim Ko: Suicidal prophecy
5/15/19, 10:25 PM - Alex Starr: Nope I was agreeing
5/15/19, 10:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: Right but now I don’t understand
5/15/19, 10:27 PM - Ricky: Lmao, in conclusion, we gonna eat hella food and talk
5/15/19, 10:27 PM - Ricky: Don’t have to be deep, but would be cool if it was below the service
5/15/19, 10:27 PM - Ricky: Surface*
5/15/19, 10:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: I think we’re all on board
5/15/19, 10:28 PM - Alex Starr: Only way we wind up that deep is with homicidal prophesy
5/15/19, 10:28 PM - Tim Ko: https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/fashion/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html

5/15/19, 10:31 PM - Collin Hurst: Those questions are really good
5/15/19, 10:32 PM - Collin Hurst: You don't have to ask all 50 lol
5/15/19, 10:32 PM - Collin Hurst: That will make it feel unnatural
5/15/19, 10:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: I would say in my experience, if you genuinely want to play with someone that’s all you need

5/15/19, 10:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: We’ve been having some good chat convos on here lately, wouldn’t it be nice to talk shit over?
5/15/19, 10:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: Controversial or sensitive topics are cool
5/15/19, 10:42 PM - Alex Starr: Debatable
5/15/19, 10:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: We could debate
5/15/19, 10:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: Why do you put deep in quotes
5/15/19, 10:44 PM - Alex Starr: ^
5/15/19, 10:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: What elements would you put in a deep conversation?
5/15/19, 10:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: Independent of our group
5/15/19, 10:47 PM - Alex Starr: I’m not claiming to be any more capable of deep conversation than anyone here
5/15/19, 10:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: No one said you were
5/15/19, 10:49 PM - Alex Starr: I meant more I don’t know
5/15/19, 10:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: Would you feel able to identify one?
5/15/19, 10:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ah
5/15/19, 10:49 PM - Alex Starr: I’m not entirely sure they exist
5/15/19, 10:50 PM - Alex Starr: Depth here seems pretty tricky to define? Is it portentous? Momentous? Intimate? Hotly-debated?
5/15/19, 10:50 PM - Alex Starr: Vitally important?
5/15/19, 10:50 PM - Collin Hurst: Mvhs
5/15/19, 10:50 PM - Collin Hurst: We will buy it and make it our compound
5/15/19, 10:53 PM - Alex Starr: I’d say the closest word is meaningful.  But that’s just as unmeaningful as deep
5/15/19, 10:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: Well you could define it in relation to surface-level conversations, but without the depth definition it those don’t exist either but it doesn’t really matter for this question, because you know when you’re having conversations that feel superficial and you know to some degree when you’re speaking as honestly as the situation permits
5/15/19, 10:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: It’s difficult to debate that one
5/15/19, 10:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: Clearly
5/15/19, 10:56 PM - Alex Starr: My takeaway is that deep to you means honest
5/15/19, 10:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: I think they’re pretty interconnected and deep is a culturally relative term. If you’re someone who feels that they’re very honest in the full sense of the word and knows themselves well enough to say that, I could see why that would be lackluster definition
5/15/19, 11:00 PM - Ricky: You wanna know what’s deep? Jasons mom following me on insta and liking my post :’)
5/15/19, 11:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: Noooo
5/15/19, 11:01 PM - Alex Starr: Not the case on the feeling honest front for me.  But I do tend to be skeptical of honesty in general.  I have to sleep.  Have final at 7 pm.
5/15/19, 11:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: Good luck!
5/15/19, 11:01 PM - Collin Hurst: That's DEEP
5/15/19, 11:01 PM - Alex Starr: Thanks, it’s the CS one so will be tricky
5/15/19, 11:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: We should discuss in the future tho
5/15/19, 11:01 PM - Ricky: Dang!!! Get up early for that one!
5/15/19, 11:02 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’m interested in what you’re saying here
5/15/19, 11:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha
5/15/19, 11:09 PM - Darren: You had my curiosity, but now you have my attention
5/15/19, 11:09 PM - Ricky: That was most definitely made to market toward your interests
5/15/19, 11:10 PM - Ricky: Mostly the first but knew the others wouldn’t hurt
5/15/19, 11:10 PM - Darren: I love them all
5/15/19, 11:10 PM - Ricky: As any good man should
5/15/19, 11:23 PM - Tim Ko: I feel like Alex has a lot of things we don’t know about him
5/15/19, 11:23 PM - Collin Hurst: ^
5/15/19, 11:23 PM - Tim Ko: We could have a whole deep convo on the topic of Alex
5/15/19, 11:24 PM - Collin Hurst: true
5/15/19, 11:24 PM - Tim Ko: Alextolotgy
5/15/19, 11:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: You’re his roommate
5/15/19, 11:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
5/15/19, 11:25 PM - Tim Ko: Doesn’t mean I know his mind lol
5/15/19, 11:25 PM - Collin Hurst: and they were roommates
5/15/19, 11:25 PM - Darren: I roomed with Matt and he's still a mystery wrapped in an enigma
5/15/19, 11:27 PM - Tim Ko: We can have the topic be on Matt and Alex!
5/15/19, 11:27 PM - Tim Ko: Malex
5/15/19, 11:30 PM - Darren: No
5/15/19, 11:30 PM - Collin Hurst: youre right it shold be Aatt
5/15/19, 11:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: That’s a laxative
5/15/19, 11:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: Almost
5/15/19, 11:34 PM - Vaughn: Definitely Aatt
5/15/19, 11:35 PM - Vaughn: Hahahs
5/15/19, 11:39 PM - Tim Ko: How would one pronounce Aatt
5/15/19, 11:39 PM - Collin Hurst: either "at" or "AY-att"
5/15/19, 11:39 PM - Collin Hurst: imo
5/15/19, 11:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: Past tense of eat
5/15/19, 11:40 PM - Collin Hurst: oh i don't know about that cap'n
5/16/19, 7:13 AM - Alex Starr: I’m with Collin like the hotels Hyatt
5/16/19, 8:01 AM - Alex Starr: Also damn my inability to sleep before exams
5/16/19, 8:02 AM - Ricky: Damn damn damn
5/16/19, 8:04 AM - Alex Starr: This is why 7 pm finals should be banned
5/16/19, 8:05 AM - Alex Starr: We need 5AM-8AM and 9-12 as the only options
5/16/19, 8:23 AM - Parker: Lmao
5/16/19, 8:23 AM - Parker: Means you could more than us though
5/16/19, 8:24 AM - Ricky: Just go and study till 7pm
5/16/19, 8:27 AM - Alex Starr: Studying day of is usually a bad idea
5/16/19, 8:27 AM - Jason Greenberg: You don’t wanna drain yourself if you don’t have to
5/16/19, 8:28 AM - Jason Greenberg: Would you do sprints before a race?
5/16/19, 8:30 AM - Alex Starr: Took the words right out of my mouth
5/16/19, 8:30 AM - Alex Starr: Passive studying is okay but anything serious ends poorly imo
5/16/19, 8:31 AM - Ricky: I love studying day of
5/16/19, 8:31 AM - Ricky: Like review everything you’ve studying
5/16/19, 8:31 AM - Alex Starr: Oh yeah that’s fine but like practice exams are bad
5/16/19, 8:31 AM - Ricky: So it’s all ready to be grabbed in the test
5/16/19, 8:31 AM - Ricky: Oh lol, those aren’t a thing for business
5/16/19, 8:31 AM - Alex Starr: Plus we get a pretty large cheat sheet
5/16/19, 8:32 AM - Alex Starr: My linear algebra exam is open book open note and the average was still 47 on both midterms lol
5/16/19, 8:37 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah I bet ur guys studying is super different
5/16/19, 8:45 AM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha _There is no practice exam_
5/16/19, 8:46 AM - Alex Starr: My CS class gave us every exam from the last 10 years
5/16/19, 8:46 AM - Alex Starr: Math had 1 or 0 but textbook problems are good
5/16/19, 8:47 AM - Parker: we have them
5/16/19, 8:47 AM - Parker: or get them to study
5/16/19, 9:18 AM - Ricky: Wtf
5/16/19, 9:18 AM - Ricky: Our professors are just like, here are 20 articles
5/16/19, 9:18 AM - Ricky: The questions will be on these gl
5/16/19, 9:18 AM - Ricky: Or at least mine today is
5/16/19, 9:19 AM - Ricky: I get them for finance
5/16/19, 9:19 AM - Ricky: And kindaaaa for analytics
5/16/19, 9:19 AM - Ricky: But not marketing at all
5/16/19, 9:20 AM - Parker: Oh yeah i guess marketing was less like that, more reading and term based
5/16/19, 9:20 AM - Parker: but basically all other classes i do
5/16/19, 9:20 AM - Parker: and get past tests from friends too haha
5/16/19, 9:20 AM - Alex Starr: It’s mostly memorization for marketing and such then finance is memorization + calculation?
5/16/19, 9:21 AM - Parker: Marketing 100%
5/16/19, 9:21 AM - Alex Starr: We have a fraternity here that collects them for STEM courses
5/16/19, 9:21 AM - Parker: finance is knowing how to use the formulas and applying then essentially
5/16/19, 9:21 AM - Parker: i have my finance midterm tomorrow
5/16/19, 9:21 AM - Alex Starr: Have fun
5/16/19, 9:21 AM - Ricky: Marketing you can have essential concepts to apply, but a lot is like, here are cool random things about marketing
5/16/19, 9:27 AM - Alex Starr: Is what you learn directly useful once you get a job?
5/16/19, 9:31 AM - Ricky: Depends on what you do
5/16/19, 9:31 AM - Ricky: Marketing has more pockets of jobs than you’d think
5/16/19, 9:31 AM - Ricky: I don’t wanna do social media like ever so this digital marketing class ain’t super important
5/16/19, 9:31 AM - Alex Starr: No I know it’s huge I’m asking if you day to day use what you learned
5/16/19, 9:32 AM - Ricky: But still cool understanding SEO and motivators for businesses to use different internet mediums for advertising
5/16/19, 9:32 AM - Alex Starr: Ancestry has ~40 people in science and  600 in marketing
5/16/19, 9:32 AM - Ricky: Yessir
5/16/19, 9:32 AM - Ricky: I’m taking marketing analytics next semester, I imagine that’s gonna be more for my future
5/16/19, 9:32 AM - Alex Starr: So the mathier side?
5/16/19, 9:33 AM - Ricky: I took new prod development class, that is real useful if u wanna start a company/ product line
5/16/19, 9:33 AM - Ricky: Yessir
5/16/19, 9:33 AM - Alex Starr: I can always get behind that haha
5/16/19, 9:36 AM - Alex Starr: What math do you use? Mostly statistics with a touch of calculus?
5/16/19, 9:53 AM - Jason Greenberg: Hahah
5/16/19, 9:54 AM - Parker: i wish we had a class like that bc that sounds exactly like what i wanna do
5/16/19, 9:55 AM - Parker: or would really enjoy
5/16/19, 9:57 AM - Ricky: Yeah lots of statistics
5/16/19, 9:57 AM - Ricky: But yet to take the real good analytics classes
5/16/19, 9:58 AM - Ricky: The professor is a G, he a super nice guy and has made banking doing it so is real connected and is a reliable source
5/16/19, 9:58 AM - Ricky: Gonna try and be his best friend to get an internship during year or something
5/16/19, 10:02 AM - Alex Starr: It’s crazy you will probably have a regular job in a year
5/16/19, 10:47 AM - Ricky: Yeah
5/16/19, 10:47 AM - Ricky: I’ll be one of many
5/16/19, 10:48 AM - Ricky: If all goes well with this internship it’d be dope to work for them and help them grow, less people means more responsibility/quicker up the totem pole
5/16/19, 10:48 AM - Ricky: But we’ll see
5/16/19, 10:48 AM - Ricky: Also zero emission world saving is where it’s at
5/16/19, 10:49 AM - Alex Starr: And it’ll be marketing that does it if anything outside of a miracle technology does
5/16/19, 10:51 AM - Jason Greenberg: 👀
5/16/19, 11:34 AM - Tim Ko: Gang gang

5/18/19, 12:57 PM - Vaughn: It looks incredible
5/18/19, 12:58 PM - Vaughn: Then again pokemon go trailers looked incredible
5/18/19, 1:03 PM - Darren: I disliked the trailer for Minecraft Earth because it runs into the same issue that all AR products do where its impossible to communicate the experience in an authentic way
5/18/19, 1:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah i wanna know what building looks like
5/18/19, 1:04 PM - Darren: but being able to build Minecraft structures anywhere you want and have them be permanently geolocated is dope

5/28/19, 12:01 PM - Vaughn: They say you die twice. One time when you stop breathing and a second time, a bit later on, when somebody says your name for the last time

5/29/19, 7:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: We need feature in our phones that prevents you from unintentionally texting cute things you meant to send to your SO to the last person you texted instead
5/29/19, 7:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: I've done this like 3 times this quarter
5/29/19, 8:20 PM - Parker: Lol

5/29/19, 8:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: Naked emotion
5/29/19, 8:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: Pretty gruesome stuff
5/29/19, 8:38 PM - Alex Starr: Officially what you’ve nicknamed your dick
5/29/19, 8:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha
5/29/19, 8:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: Omg
5/29/19, 8:39 PM - Alex Starr: Also a long love note would be way harder to explain/awkward than a naked picture
5/29/19, 8:39 PM - Parker: ^
5/29/19, 8:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: I will not haha
5/29/19, 8:41 PM - Alex Starr: Come on you can’t set it up then not follow through
5/29/19, 8:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: Nah
5/29/19, 8:44 PM - Tim Ko: Haha I was kidding
5/29/19, 8:44 PM - Tim Ko: I can imagine, especially if ur working stuff out over text
5/29/19, 8:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: Tangent I am stoked to get to summer time and hang with peeps
5/29/19, 8:44 PM - Tim Ko: Gang
5/29/19, 8:44 PM - Collin Hurst: Gang
5/29/19, 8:44 PM - Tim Ko: Jason we will hang out at Stanford
5/29/19, 8:45 PM - Alex Starr: Secant, what inexactly did u message?
5/29/19, 8:45 PM - Alex Starr: Same I’m so bored rn lab work so slow
5/29/19, 8:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: I know haha
5/29/19, 8:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
5/29/19, 8:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: Pet name to my mom
5/29/19, 8:46 PM - Alex Starr: Haha
5/31/19, 6:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: Would you go to a food concert?
5/31/19, 6:26 PM - Alex Starr: What kind of food
5/31/19, 6:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: Doesn’t matter
5/31/19, 6:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: Premise more
5/31/19, 6:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: Could call it a flavor concert
5/31/19, 6:41 PM - Parker: What would it entail
5/31/19, 6:41 PM - Parker: like just replace artists with food?
5/31/19, 6:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: Maybe
5/31/19, 6:41 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t think good makes good music
5/31/19, 6:42 PM - Alex Starr: Food
5/31/19, 6:42 PM - Alex Starr: I’m gonna need a description of the concept
5/31/19, 6:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: If you could find a way to deliver and mass produce small dishes with interesting flavors to a concert hall of several hundred, so that everyone is trying the same thing at once, you have a social experience around the flavor. The artist delivers the flavor, the audience receives. Not a restaurant, a unified tasting experience on a large scale
5/31/19, 6:47 PM - Alex Starr: That sounds a lot like a tasting menu at a restaurant
5/31/19, 6:47 PM - Alex Starr: And also you don’t get to get high like it’s a concert
5/31/19, 6:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: It’s akin to a restaurant but bigger and in unison. If a restaurant is a living room movie, a food concert is the a movie theater screening
5/31/19, 6:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: And why the hell not?
5/31/19, 6:49 PM - Alex Starr: That kind of high
5/31/19, 6:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: Have you eaten high or drunk before?
5/31/19, 6:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: Altering your senses is still the goal
5/31/19, 6:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: Or am I misunderstanding?
5/31/19, 6:51 PM - Darren: Tasting menus are the shit
5/31/19, 6:52 PM - Vaughn: Add some music to it too
5/31/19, 6:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: Time it to the eating somehow
5/31/19, 6:52 PM - Darren: You can only chew on beat
5/31/19, 6:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: Chewing on beat unlocks a certain flavor
5/31/19, 6:53 PM - Vaughn: Like a scrath amd sniff movie but instead they play the right kind of mood music fpr different bites
5/31/19, 6:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: A scratch and sniff movie?
5/31/19, 6:54 PM - Vaughn: I think it was called smell-o-vision
5/31/19, 6:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
5/31/19, 6:55 PM - Vaughn: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smell-O-Vision
5/31/19, 6:55 PM - Vaughn: Yup
5/31/19, 6:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: They use that in Soarin over California
5/31/19, 6:56 PM - Vaughn: Spy kids 4 used aromascope
5/31/19, 6:56 PM - Vaughn: I remember dragging my mom to it in theaters
5/31/19, 6:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: There was a fourth one???
5/31/19, 6:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: After game over?
5/31/19, 6:57 PM - Vaughn: Yup
5/31/19, 6:57 PM - Vaughn: Advertised as 4d
5/31/19, 6:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: Wow
5/31/19, 6:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: What’d ya think?
5/31/19, 6:59 PM - Vaughn: At that age
5/31/19, 6:59 PM - Vaughn: I thought it was revolutionary
5/31/19, 6:59 PM - Darren: You should be preparing for your game
5/31/19, 7:01 PM - Vaughn: The othe team isnt showing up
5/31/19, 7:01 PM - Vaughn: We're going to the Intramural Kickball Finals baby!!
5/31/19, 7:03 PM - Collin Hurst: That was premature
5/31/19, 7:03 PM - Collin Hurst: They just came
5/31/19, 7:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ayyyy good luck
5/31/19, 7:37 PM - Alex Starr: Phrasing Collin

5/31/19, 9:22 PM - Tim Ko: Yee
5/31/19, 9:22 PM - Tim Ko: We can prob move around stadium too, all u really have to do is confidently walk past the guards
5/31/19, 9:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: Id wanna but wouldn’t be able to make it
5/31/19, 9:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: Have an orientation that’s over at 8
5/31/19, 9:26 PM - Tim Ko: Ohh I see :(
5/31/19, 9:26 PM - Tim Ko: Orientation for ur summer research?
5/31/19, 9:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: Crisis counseling
5/31/19, 9:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: Down to do another game tho if it happens

6/1/19, 12:55 AM - Parker: who’s in it again
6/1/19, 8:00 AM - Alex Starr: Absolute long shot but anyone know where to get vanilla beans for cheap?
6/1/19, 8:00 AM - Alex Starr: Maybe ranch 99 or something happens to have them
6/1/19, 8:26 AM - Parker: what classified as cheap
6/1/19, 8:27 AM - Parker: classifies
6/1/19, 8:39 AM - Alex Starr: I dunno
6/1/19, 8:39 AM - Alex Starr: 6 dollars
6/1/19, 8:42 AM - Parker: i know they’re like 11-12 at safeway/most grocery stores
6/1/19, 8:52 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah super expensive
6/1/19, 10:14 AM - Ricky: Can’t get real ones cheap me
6/1/19, 10:14 AM - Ricky: Rn*
6/1/19, 10:15 AM - Ricky: Horrible weather fucked up Madagascar where a lot of the worlds vanilla is made
6/1/19, 10:15 AM - Ricky: Is it’s real expensive
6/1/19, 10:54 AM - Jason Greenberg: Jesus
6/1/19, 10:54 AM - Alex Starr: And some recipes literally call for 3
6/1/19, 10:55 AM - Alex Starr: And I can’t drop 36 dollars on some tartlets
6/1/19, 10:55 AM - Alex Starr: So vanilla extract is the answer for the most part but it’s a pretty noticeable difference in a few cases
6/1/19, 10:56 AM - Jason Greenberg: The price for a pound is over 300 dollars
6/1/19, 10:56 AM - Jason Greenberg: Fuck
6/1/19, 10:57 AM - Jason Greenberg: Apparently French chefs like yourself are switching to synthetic vanilla
6/1/19, 10:58 AM - Alex Starr: I don’t buy it haha
6/1/19, 10:58 AM - Alex Starr: R they actually?
6/1/19, 10:59 AM - Alex Starr: Cuz vanillin is shitty
6/1/19, 11:02 AM - Alex Starr: Artificially synthesized that is
6/1/19, 11:02 AM - Parker: sure you can
6/1/19, 11:03 AM - Alex Starr: Eh extract works fine in the caramel and in the tart case, just doesn’t work for the pastry cream
6/1/19, 11:05 AM - Parker: You gotta get the beans
6/1/19, 11:05 AM - Parker: LARS GET THE BEANS
6/1/19, 11:06 AM - Alex Starr: Ya cost plus usually has them for cheap
6/1/19, 11:06 AM - Alex Starr: And the Safeway up in Berkeley had them for 7$
6/1/19, 11:06 AM - Alex Starr: Which is still ludicrous
6/1/19, 11:06 AM - Alex Starr: But it’s not like I buy anything else
6/1/19, 11:06 AM - Parker: 7 ain’t bad
6/1/19, 12:39 PM - Vaughn: Hahahaha

6/1/19, 2:50 PM - Collin Hurst: 30? idk
6/1/19, 2:51 PM - Alex Starr: Wait it’s an English league right
6/1/19, 2:52 PM - Darren: Yeah, but the premier league in particular is super cosmopolitan
6/1/19, 2:52 PM - Collin Hurst: Champions league is the playoffs of all the top leagues
6/1/19, 2:52 PM - Collin Hurst: But the two teams playing are from the British league
6/1/19, 3:13 PM - Parker: Champions league isn’t british

6/1/19, 9:56 PM - Tim Ko: That could be a new fun fact u can use when introducing urselves
6/1/19, 10:03 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah that would be a cool story if nothing else
6/1/19, 10:44 PM - Collin Hurst: I wanna go cause it would be cool to see the place at night
6/1/19, 10:44 PM - Collin Hurst: And it's essentially half off regular admission

6/2/19, 12:29 PM - Collin Hurst: Aw:( what's up
6/2/19, 12:33 PM - Parker: well i found out tristyn took kevin(guy i’ve talked about who’s literally the biggest narc among other things) to her formal on friday and like that they’ve continued to hookup and whatnot and idk i kinda just lashed out on her bc i just don’t understand why she does what she does and i know i can’t control it and it’s not my business but it’s frustrating and makes me upset
6/2/19, 12:33 PM - Parker: and she says it’s “just sex” but taking someone to formal and hanging out a lot is t just sex
6/2/19, 12:34 PM - Parker: and he’s just a douche and not even remotely attractive and literally no one in our extended circle of friends likes him nor understands why she’s doing all of this
6/2/19, 12:35 PM - Parker: Anyways, we had a party at our place last night and she was suppose to come to pregame but then i got mad at her in the morning so she didn’t come until later which made me sad bc we have a week left together but once she came we talked or atleast tried to talk and then she just stormed off and went home
6/2/19, 12:35 PM - Parker: which i just think is immature af
6/2/19, 12:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah that’d be frustrating as hell
6/2/19, 12:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: She sounds like an avoider big time
6/2/19, 12:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: Like not wanting to be direct and literally avoiding you
6/2/19, 12:50 PM - Parker: Yeah and i literally can’t talk to her about anything about that without her getting mad or raising her voice or storming off
6/2/19, 1:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah if she can’t look at her own behavior what kind of precedent does that set for you guys?
6/2/19, 1:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: Are there any times when you have been able to talk to her about your frustrations about her?
6/2/19, 1:52 PM - Tim Ko: Aww damn bro I’m sorry about all this :((
6/2/19, 1:53 PM - Parker: yeah constantly
6/2/19, 1:54 PM - Parker: atleast most of this term
6/2/19, 1:54 PM - Parker: and i when i lashed out yesterday i said some pretty harsh things but like i’m not gonna try to justify it or feel the need to bc it’s how i feel
6/2/19, 2:03 PM - Darren: This is the most aggressive thing I've ever witnessed Parker say
6/2/19, 2:04 PM - Parker: You should’ve heard some of the things i said to her then😂😂😂

6/13/19, 9:39 PM - Tim Ko: Just gotta come back strong next year
6/13/19, 9:39 PM - Tim Ko: But we screwed ourselves by playing KD
6/13/19, 9:39 PM - Tim Ko: If we pulled it off this year might have been worth
6/13/19, 9:40 PM - Tim Ko: And we prob were gonna pull it off if Klay didn’t get injured
6/13/19, 9:41 PM - Parker: ^
6/13/19, 9:42 PM - Parker: i think this was a blessing in disguise though
6/13/19, 9:42 PM - Parker: i think kd comes back
6/13/19, 9:42 PM - Parker: KD has to play in that circumstance
6/13/19, 9:42 PM - Parker: hindsight’s 20/20
6/13/19, 9:46 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah

6/13/19, 9:49 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
6/13/19, 9:49 PM - Tim Ko: Hmm good point but u think KD leaves if warriors pulled this off?
6/13/19, 9:50 PM - Tim Ko: Think after the injury he sees how much warriors mean to him
6/13/19, 9:50 PM - Parker: Yeah he’s family now
6/13/19, 9:50 PM - Parker: like if that doesn’t convince idk what will
6/13/19, 9:50 PM - Tim Ko: Exactly lmao
6/13/19, 9:50 PM - Tim Ko: That’s why this was such a great opportunity to win plus retain KD
6/13/19, 9:51 PM - Tim Ko: Honestly if KD never got injured and warriors dominate, he prob gone
6/13/19, 9:51 PM - Tim Ko: If he never came back and warriors win it all, he def gone lmao
6/13/19, 9:52 PM - Tim Ko: Ah well, time for A’s baseball now

6/18/19, 11:04 PM - Parker: i’m not happy about it either
6/18/19, 11:04 PM - Tim Ko: Gotta figure out how to sneak jason and Matt
6/18/19, 11:05 PM - Parker: it’s my step moms aunts bday and i’ve seen her maybe 3 times in my life lol
6/18/19, 11:05 PM - Tim Ko: I’m thinking we don’t show tickets and just confidently walk in
6/18/19, 11:05 PM - Parker: and it’s like a 2.5 hour drive
6/18/19, 11:05 PM - Tim Ko: Then if they ask maybe us 4 show and Jason and Matt pretend they lost theirs
6/18/19, 11:06 PM - Tim Ko: But I’m pretty sure they won’t ask
6/19/19, 7:53 AM - Ricky: Or we can play it safe, have a few of us walk back and forth enough times that we build a mini rep with one of the guard people to the point that we don’t need to show our ticket anymore, then give our ticket to Jason and Matt
6/19/19, 7:54 AM - Ricky: And we make sure our guard is as old as possible
6/19/19, 8:29 AM - Vaughn: We could say matt and jason are make a wish kids and all they wat is to get a view from the first deck
6/19/19, 8:30 AM - Parker: ^
6/19/19, 8:30 AM - Parker: say they have one week to live and that’s their dying wish
6/19/19, 8:33 AM - Vaughn: And theyll be like awwww poor guys
6/19/19, 8:34 AM - Vaughn: At an a's game? Mustve been a rough life
6/19/19, 8:49 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah that dying wish is so tragic they couldn’t possibly refuse
6/19/19, 8:49 AM - Alex Starr: Or maybe out of pity they would refuse
6/19/19, 9:00 AM - Ricky: Last nights I honestly had the thought that if I was dying my make a wish would be to hit BP with the A’d before I get weak
6/19/19, 10:41 AM - Tim Ko: Lol
6/19/19, 10:41 AM - Tim Ko: Ricky u could take a lunch break and go to the A’s game today! It starts at 12:30 hahah
6/19/19, 10:42 AM - Tim Ko: I still can’t believe how close u are to the stadium
6/19/19, 10:42 AM - Tim Ko: If I were that close I might just go almost everyday lol
6/19/19, 10:42 AM - Tim Ko: This is good
6/19/19, 10:43 AM - Tim Ko: Also I think I can photoshop the stubhub tickets so matt and Jason can go to super good seats hahaha
6/19/19, 10:47 AM - Ricky: IO know!!!
6/19/19, 10:48 AM - Ricky: I'm happy cuz my boss isn't coming in today, and i just moved so im facing a wall, and so i am gonna play the A's game in the background
6/19/19, 10:48 AM - Ricky: or like my screen is facing a wall so no one can see my comp ahah

6/19/19, 10:52 AM - Tim Ko: Nah man, it looks just like the real thing

6/30/19, 2:12 PM - Parker: they’re getting kd kyrie and deandre jordan
6/30/19, 2:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: Uh we didn’t have plans to
6/30/19, 2:51 PM - Tim Ko: The dankest timeline would be warriors meeting the nets in the finals and beating them
6/30/19, 3:20 PM - Ricky: Hahahaha
6/30/19, 3:20 PM - Ricky: That would be insane
6/30/19, 3:23 PM - Tim Ko: I will shotgun a beer if that happens
6/30/19, 3:23 PM - Tim Ko: And the proceed to throw up on cal train again
6/30/19, 3:23 PM - Parker: hahahahaha
6/30/19, 3:23 PM - Parker: bet
6/30/19, 3:24 PM - Parker: that would be sick
6/30/19, 5:38 PM - Darren: @16505758873 you look beautiful in your insta post
6/30/19, 5:43 PM - Alex Starr: I’m no expert, but don’t you usually reserve that kind of talk for a less public message?
6/30/19, 5:46 PM - Darren: You're right
6/30/19, 5:46 PM - Darren: You aren't an expert
6/30/19, 5:48 PM - Alex Starr: Lucky guess on my part then
6/30/19, 5:59 PM - Parker: you’re too kind
6/30/19, 5:59 PM - Parker: ❤
6/30/19, 5:59 PM - Parker: maybe he wanted it to be public
6/30/19, 6:00 PM - Alex Starr: Nah societal pressure prevented him from shooting for a more private setting
6/30/19, 6:37 PM - Collin Hurst: Looks like pavelski to Dallas:(
6/30/19, 6:37 PM - Parker: yeah :((((
6/30/19, 6:37 PM - Parker: rough day for the bay
6/30/19, 6:37 PM - Parker: dallas🤮
6/30/19, 7:33 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
6/30/19, 7:34 PM - Alex Starr: Where’s the sauce?
6/30/19, 7:35 PM - Matt Casali: Mixed into the pasta
6/30/19, 7:36 PM - Matt Casali: I miscalculated the sauce : pasta ratio a bit though haha
6/30/19, 7:38 PM - Alex Starr: Ah okay
6/30/19, 7:38 PM - Alex Starr: When I’ve made it I’ve made like 4x the sauce haha
6/30/19, 7:42 PM - Alex Starr: Than the recipe called for if that was unclear
6/30/19, 7:42 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah, it was a weird process for the sauce but now I know I just need a lot more wine and chicken stock
6/30/19, 7:45 PM - Alex Starr: Did u thicken the sauce with flour or cornstarch?
6/30/19, 7:48 PM - Matt Casali: No I just whisked it in a sauce pan
6/30/19, 7:49 PM - Alex Starr: Ah okay
6/30/19, 7:49 PM - Alex Starr: Interesting to see the variety
6/30/19, 7:49 PM - Parker: haha you sound judgmental
6/30/19, 7:55 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah I realized that, but saying I wasn’t being judgmental would just make it look slightly worse
6/30/19, 7:55 PM - Ricky: A’s won, gang
6/30/19, 7:56 PM - Ricky: Also this was 10/10 got heem moment
6/30/19, 7:57 PM - Matt Casali: I didnt think it was haha
6/30/19, 7:58 PM - Matt Casali: But yeah, I think I burned a lot of the sauce away by keeping it in the pan and whisking it so maybe flour or cornstarch would be better
6/30/19, 7:58 PM - Alex Starr: I’ve seen both, you cook it down then add a little flour slurry and cook til thickened
6/30/19, 7:59 PM - Alex Starr: 10/10?
6/30/19, 7:59 PM - Parker: haha i know it wasn’t his intention but i knew it was slightly
6/30/19, 7:59 PM - Parker: irrelevant
6/30/19, 8:03 PM - Ricky: And giants!
6/30/19, 8:03 PM - Ricky: So important sports are doing big things
6/30/19, 8:03 PM - Parker: Haha i guess
6/30/19, 8:04 PM - Parker: my top two teams lost their best players though haha
6/30/19, 8:06 PM - Ricky: Hey. We still got Alen Smeilagić
6/30/19, 8:07 PM - Alex Starr: The niners traded a 2020 2nd round pick?
6/30/19, 8:08 PM - Parker: Lol
6/30/19, 8:08 PM - Parker: try my like fifth favorite
6/30/19, 8:09 PM - Parker: true, the croatian sensation
6/30/19, 8:09 PM - Parker: or wherever tf he from
6/30/19, 8:09 PM - Tim Ko: GANGGGGG
6/30/19, 8:10 PM - Tim Ko: KD ain’t winning shit with the nets
6/30/19, 8:10 PM - Tim Ko: Kyries got a 2nd grade education
6/30/19, 8:10 PM - Tim Ko: DJ can’t throw a rock in the ocean
6/30/19, 8:10 PM - Ricky: We getting HOT for that post All star run
6/30/19, 8:10 PM - Tim Ko: Yeeeeee
6/30/19, 8:10 PM - Tim Ko: Plus we getting our good pitchers back for the 2nd half
6/30/19, 8:10 PM - Parker: he’s so washed it’s unreal hahaha they’re grouping the three together like he’s even close to their level😂😂😂
6/30/19, 8:11 PM - Ricky: Lowkey scared for the twins thought
6/30/19, 8:11 PM - Tim Ko: Also Matt Chapman an all star
6/30/19, 8:11 PM - Ricky: Yeeee
6/30/19, 8:11 PM - Tim Ko: Ikr lol
6/30/19, 8:11 PM - Ricky: Yooooo he too good boi
6/30/19, 8:11 PM - Tim Ko: Kyrie couldn’t win with a well balanced and deep team, he won’t win with KD, DJ, and a bunch of scrubs
6/30/19, 8:12 PM - Parker: yeah and kyries personality i feel is toxic
6/30/19, 8:12 PM - Tim Ko: Yep
6/30/19, 8:12 PM - Parker: like he didn’t wanna be in boston but going to another team isn’t much different
6/30/19, 8:12 PM - Tim Ko: KD too soft for him
6/30/19, 8:12 PM - Parker: he also said in october he was staying in boston so he’s just shady
6/30/19, 8:12 PM - Tim Ko: Warriors can finally develop players now
6/30/19, 8:12 PM - Parker: you’re only in your home city for half the season anyways lol
6/30/19, 8:13 PM - Parker: if you’re not happy in boston or cleveland, maybe you’re just not happy anywhere haha
6/30/19, 8:13 PM - Parker: both good teams he’s been on
6/30/19, 8:13 PM - Parker: yee i hope they get one decent free agent and then invest in better role players
6/30/19, 8:13 PM - Parker: get d Lo
6/30/19, 8:13 PM - Alex Starr: Well that’s not fair if you aren’t happy in Cleveland your sane
6/30/19, 8:13 PM - Alex Starr: Youre*
6/30/19, 8:13 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
6/30/19, 8:13 PM - Parker: Haha i know but excluding the city, he was on a good team
6/30/19, 8:14 PM - Tim Ko: Yee, tho that’s unlikely
6/30/19, 8:14 PM - Parker: obviously cleveland is a shit hole
6/30/19, 8:14 PM - Parker: they said they could get him in a sign and trade though
6/30/19, 8:14 PM - Alex Starr: Only it’s proximity to Detroit saves it
6/30/19, 8:14 PM - Parker: but idk
6/30/19, 8:14 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah but nets have no reason to do it. Only reason KD would do it is to make more money but warriors can only win and trade with the 4 yr contract
6/30/19, 8:15 PM - Tim Ko: Only way it happens is if KD wants to be nice to us lol
6/30/19, 8:15 PM - Parker: yeah basically
6/30/19, 8:15 PM - Parker: which doesn’t look like it’s gonna happen
6/30/19, 8:15 PM - Tim Ko: Pistons looking up @16507145032
6/30/19, 8:15 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah
6/30/19, 8:16 PM - Parker: i’m interested to see his reasons behind it because looking at basketball alone, it’s a terrible move
6/30/19, 8:16 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah lol
6/30/19, 8:16 PM - Tim Ko: Probably legacy and cupcake stuff
6/30/19, 8:17 PM - Parker: Like in terms of money, winning, and location it makes no sense
6/30/19, 8:17 PM - Parker: yeah or he wanted to live in new york or something
6/30/19, 8:18 PM - Parker: i know he wanted to play with kyrie was part of it
6/30/19, 8:18 PM - Parker: but like steph >>>>>>>> kyrie
6/30/19, 8:21 PM - Tim Ko: Also apparently he and Kyrie are taking less than the max so DJ can get a raise lmao
6/30/19, 8:21 PM - Tim Ko: That team is not gonna be that good
6/30/19, 8:22 PM - Tim Ko: Lakers better tbh
6/30/19, 8:22 PM - Parker: i saw that hahaha
6/30/19, 8:22 PM - Parker: they’ll be fun to watch once kd is back though
6/30/19, 8:24 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah
6/30/19, 8:52 PM - Matt Casali: You guys just sound salty
6/30/19, 8:54 PM - Parker: Haha nah i’m happy for him
6/30/19, 8:54 PM - Parker: tim is more salty
6/30/19, 8:54 PM - Parker: he brought us rings and the best team of all time so he can do what he wants
6/30/19, 8:54 PM - Parker: i’m happy for what he did for us
6/30/19, 8:54 PM - Parker: D LO LETS GOOO
6/30/19, 8:56 PM - Alex Starr: Ya I didn’t get much salt from Parker
6/30/19, 8:57 PM - Alex Starr: Well seasoned
6/30/19, 9:00 PM - Parker: Lol
6/30/19, 9:00 PM - Parker: I can’t hate the man
6/30/19, 9:00 PM - Parker: and as dubs fans we shouldn’t stoop to that level
6/30/19, 9:00 PM - Tim Ko: Ayyyyy
6/30/19, 9:01 PM - Tim Ko: LETS GOOOOO
6/30/19, 9:04 PM - Tim Ko: I don’t hate KD, just doesn’t make sense why he did that
6/30/19, 9:07 PM - Parker: D LO is gonna be sick
6/30/19, 9:07 PM - Parker: i really like him
6/30/19, 9:09 PM - Tim Ko: Yeeee
6/30/19, 9:11 PM - Tim Ko: Too bad iggy had to go
6/30/19, 9:11 PM - Tim Ko: He was getting old anyways
6/30/19, 9:14 PM - Parker: i’m way more sad about that than KD
6/30/19, 9:15 PM - Parker: he was a real one
6/30/19, 9:15 PM - Tim Ko: ^
6/30/19, 9:15 PM - Tim Ko: He was the first one to actually want to come to golden state lmao
6/30/19, 9:16 PM - Parker: yeah exactly
6/30/19, 9:16 PM - Parker: and always kept it 💯

7/6/19, 10:33 PM - Tim Ko: There is a new place in downtown mv
7/6/19, 10:33 PM - Tim Ko: Also we should cook together one of these days!
7/6/19, 10:34 PM - Tim Ko: Each person makes their best dish
7/6/19, 10:37 PM - Parker: no i haven’t tried the new spot yet but want to! it’s like 3 doors down from the other hot pot place haha
7/6/19, 10:37 PM - Parker: yeeee
7/6/19, 10:42 PM - Alex Starr: Idk how that would work.  Not enough room in a kitchen but a potluckesque thing id be down
7/6/19, 10:50 PM - Parker: yeah potluck would make more sense
7/6/19, 10:50 PM - Parker: bottom line: eat together
7/6/19, 10:53 PM - Tim Ko: ^
7/6/19, 10:53 PM - Parker: no matter the form or setting
7/6/19, 10:53 PM - Tim Ko: And socialize with one another while we eat together
7/6/19, 10:54 PM - Alex Starr: Nah cold blooded aggressive silence
7/6/19, 10:54 PM - Parker: No i thought we’d sit in absolute silence
7/6/19, 10:54 PM - Alex Starr: Nothing but icy stares and the occasional glare
7/6/19, 10:54 PM - Parker: no eye contact
7/6/19, 10:55 PM - Parker: no noises
7/6/19, 10:55 PM - Alex Starr: Some eye contact.
7/6/19, 10:55 PM - Parker: pretend we’re alone
7/6/19, 10:55 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz it’s pretty hard to feel any hate without eye contact
7/6/19, 11:20 PM - Tim Ko: What if we tried that one night
7/6/19, 11:20 PM - Tim Ko: Would be interesting
7/6/19, 11:21 PM - Collin Hurst: I'd be more in for a 9 day food crawl
7/6/19, 11:21 PM - Collin Hurst: Every person hosts one meal
7/6/19, 11:23 PM - Tim Ko: That’s a good idea haha
7/7/19, 12:43 AM - Ricky: Does sound good
7/7/19, 12:43 AM - Ricky: Also we should do kbbq for sure
7/7/19, 12:43 AM - Ricky: And dim sum again

7/7/19, 8:01 PM - Alex Starr: That’s what I thought I remembered but your hahaha threw me
7/7/19, 8:01 PM - Parker: oh yeah no i just remember you guys saying that
7/7/19, 8:15 PM - Tim Ko: Ugh Ricky I’m sorry, I don’t think I can come. It’ll be 2 weeks before my test and I take practice tests all day on saturdays
7/7/19, 8:15 PM - Alex Starr: Also Berkeley on the 19th
7/7/19, 8:15 PM - Tim Ko: I would only be free on sat evening :(
7/7/19, 8:16 PM - Alex Starr: How’ve the practice tests been?
7/7/19, 8:17 PM - Tim Ko: Not too bad. I did shitty on my 1st one but tests 2-5 have been right around where I wouldn’t have to retake if I got those scores
7/7/19, 8:17 PM - Alex Starr: Nice
7/7/19, 8:18 PM - Tim Ko: Tho I’ve only taken 3rd party tests which are supposed to be harder so I’ll see how I’ll do on the official practice tests
7/7/19, 8:18 PM - Tim Ko: Down
7/7/19, 8:18 PM - Parker: that’s the day i start housesitting :(
7/7/19, 8:18 PM - Tim Ko: Tho I’ll lay off the whiskey this time 😅
7/7/19, 8:19 PM - Tim Ko: I still feel so bad for whoever had to clean that up on the cal train lol
7/7/19, 8:19 PM - Parker: Lol yeah :(
7/7/19, 8:23 PM - Matt Casali: Tim I'm gonna be honest, I probably would have thrown up if I mixed my beer with whiskey too haha
7/7/19, 8:29 PM - Matt Casali: Also, the U16 select team for AY just won nationals
7/7/19, 8:30 PM - Matt Casali: Still not as good as Vaughn, darren and my select team
7/7/19, 8:38 PM - Ricky: Yaw yeet! Excited!
7/7/19, 8:39 PM - Ricky: Vaughn Collin can y’all come?
7/7/19, 8:39 PM - Ricky: I know Jason is in “Vegas” where ever that means
7/7/19, 8:51 PM - Tim Ko: Wait what’s bad about mixing it?
7/7/19, 8:54 PM - Parker: Nah you’re def allergic
7/7/19, 8:55 PM - Parker: if you mixed like 4 or 5 things that would do it
7/7/19, 8:55 PM - Ricky: No yeah, Tim u allergic
7/7/19, 8:55 PM - Ricky: I’ve deff had beer with a multitude of random things, does not cause immediate throwing up
7/7/19, 8:55 PM - Ricky: Or delayed throwing up
7/7/19, 8:56 PM - Parker: yeah same
7/7/19, 8:57 PM - Collin Hurst: We didn't take the pill correctly
7/7/19, 8:57 PM - Parker: isn’t the pill for asian glow though
7/7/19, 8:57 PM - Collin Hurst: When I had my first drinks my ankles swelled up remember lol
7/7/19, 8:58 PM - Collin Hurst: Asian glow is being allergic
7/7/19, 8:58 PM - Collin Hurst: Not just the glow
7/7/19, 8:58 PM - Parker: Ohh, But like young got bad asian glow but wouldn’t throw up
7/7/19, 8:58 PM - Parker: but i guess different people have different severities
7/7/19, 8:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: I blame the burrito
7/7/19, 8:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: Sorry my boy. I will make it up to you in some way
7/7/19, 9:01 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah that’s why I thought lol
7/7/19, 9:02 PM - Tim Ko: Cuz I only had prob one shot of whiskey and one can of beer
7/7/19, 9:02 PM - Tim Ko: Also Ricky I could drive up to Arnold on sat evening, it’s only like 2.5 hrs right?
7/7/19, 9:03 PM - Ricky: It’s okie ❤ I’m calling you out in a sorrowful way
7/7/19, 9:11 PM - Matt Casali: No I just mean that the mix sounds really bad haha
7/7/19, 9:30 PM - Alex Starr: Isn’t putting a shot of whiskey into a beer a thing?
7/7/19, 9:30 PM - Alex Starr: Boilermaker
7/7/19, 9:32 PM - Alex Starr: I do too
7/7/19, 9:32 PM - Vaughn: Yes!
7/7/19, 9:34 PM - Collin Hurst: Ye
7/7/19, 9:41 PM - Parker: like a dropshot
7/7/19, 9:42 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah that’s a boilermaker
7/7/19, 9:42 PM - Alex Starr: Beer with a shot of whiskey dropped in
7/7/19, 9:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: That’s a mine in rage cage
7/7/19, 9:48 PM - Alex Starr: Apparently if you add Irish cream and the beer is a stout it becomes an Irish car bomb.  And Germans call a shot of vodka into a beer a u-boot
7/7/19, 9:49 PM - Parker: that sounds kinda good
7/7/19, 9:49 PM - Parker: the first one
7/7/19, 9:49 PM - Matt Casali: I agree, I would def have that
7/7/19, 9:54 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah the second one sounds good in the sense that you’ll probably stop being able to taste it pretty fast
7/7/19, 10:14 PM - Parker: and it’ll get to where you wanna be haha
7/7/19, 10:14 PM - Parker: get you*
7/7/19, 10:19 PM - Vaughn: I wonder if theres a shot that includes numbing chinese sauce
7/7/19, 11:23 PM - Parker: <Media omitted>
7/7/19, 11:23 PM - Parker: god damn puig
7/7/19, 11:27 PM - Collin Hurst: Wth
7/7/19, 11:27 PM - Collin Hurst: Is that allowed
7/7/19, 11:43 PM - Parker: bout to get drug tested lmao
7/8/19, 9:32 AM - Jason Greenberg: will you pass?
7/8/19, 10:23 AM - Alex Starr: Pretty sure he meant the baseball player
7/8/19, 10:24 AM - Matt Casali: I definitely thought he meant himself too haha
7/8/19, 10:24 AM - Parker: yeah wait what haha
7/8/19, 10:37 AM - Tim Ko: Lmao
7/8/19, 10:38 AM - Tim Ko: The thing is Parker is the baseball player
7/8/19, 10:38 AM - Tim Ko: Part time side job
7/8/19, 10:38 AM - Alex Starr: Why r u being drug tested Parker?
7/8/19, 10:39 AM - Parker: ...
7/8/19, 10:39 AM - Parker: i’m not hahahaha
7/8/19, 10:39 AM - Parker: wtf
7/8/19, 10:42 AM - Alex Starr: K so what was this in reference to
7/8/19, 10:42 AM - Alex Starr: Cuz this leads me to believe you didn’t mean the baseball player
7/8/19, 10:54 AM - Parker: the exact opposite haha
7/8/19, 10:54 AM - Parker: i was confused why they thought i meant me
7/8/19, 10:56 AM - Jason Greenberg: you do have a history of drug tests
7/8/19, 10:57 AM - Collin Hurst: I test drugs all the time
7/8/19, 10:57 AM - Jason Greenberg: unrelated but related I'm getting one tomorrow
7/8/19, 10:57 AM - Jason Greenberg: nice
7/8/19, 10:57 AM - Collin Hurst: For what?
7/8/19, 10:57 AM - Parker: ^
7/8/19, 10:57 AM - Collin Hurst: That's not unrelated lol
7/8/19, 10:57 AM - Jason Greenberg: fmri study
7/8/19, 10:57 AM - Collin Hurst: O ok
7/8/19, 10:57 AM - Collin Hurst: So they won't care if you got thc
7/8/19, 11:14 AM - Jason Greenberg: They will but I think they said 4-5 days abstinence is what they’re looking for
7/8/19, 11:14 AM - Jason Greenberg: Well I know they said that*
7/8/19, 11:17 AM - Tim Ko: That’s the one where they inject glucose in u?
7/8/19, 11:18 AM - Jason Greenberg: Not to my knowledge
7/8/19, 11:18 AM - Tim Ko: Never mind that’s PET
7/8/19, 11:19 AM - Jason Greenberg: There we go

7/8/19, 6:57 PM - Ricky: Like less then half the A’s lineup 😂
7/8/19, 6:57 PM - Ricky: But he hits the ball far as fuck
7/8/19, 6:57 PM - Parker: Ohhh gotcha

7/8/19, 6:57 PM - Ricky: Yeet
7/8/19, 7:16 PM - Parker: Yeah true
7/8/19, 7:17 PM - Parker: his potential is high though
7/8/19, 7:17 PM - Parker: and like marketing wise it’s a really good move
7/9/19, 11:35 AM - Ricky: what do people think about going to Berkeley next weekend? like the 20th?
7/9/19, 11:45 AM - Vaughn: Yes!
7/9/19, 11:47 AM - Matt Casali: I can't :(

7/9/19, 12:11 PM - Parker: i definitely can’t this weekend so i’d be more likely next weekend
7/9/19, 12:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’m free I think
7/9/19, 12:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: But fratting is unimpressive for me
7/9/19, 12:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’d be more down for like a herd escape room
7/9/19, 1:58 PM - Alex Starr: Either way come up July 19th.  It’ll be post midterm for me so I should be somewhat free
7/9/19, 2:13 PM - Collin Hurst: Midterm

7/9/19, 3:16 PM - Alex Starr: I haven’t heard of DU so they probably aren’t _that_ fratty
7/9/19, 3:18 PM - Alex Starr: Also what the hell does upsilon look like?
7/9/19, 3:18 PM - Alex Starr: Oh it’s just a Y no wonder we never use it
7/9/19, 3:22 PM - Parker: Yeah just a Y haha
7/9/19, 3:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: Maybe over text
7/9/19, 3:45 PM - Alex Starr: I think it was more a specific way of saying he didn’t want to go.  Sort of “been there done that not a fan how bout this”
7/9/19, 3:50 PM - Ricky: ahah i know, just the ording was funny
7/9/19, 3:50 PM - Ricky: wording
7/9/19, 3:51 PM - Alex Starr: I agree
7/9/19, 3:51 PM - Alex Starr: It was a little unimpressive for me
7/9/19, 3:52 PM - Ricky: haha
7/9/19, 3:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lol
7/10/19, 11:25 AM - Jason Greenberg: Who’s free to hang Friday

7/10/19, 5:45 PM - Ricky: Hahahaha
7/10/19, 5:45 PM - Ricky: Why linked in?
7/10/19, 5:45 PM - Ricky: I feel like that’s least funny/most destructive
7/10/19, 5:46 PM - Alex Starr: Facebook
7/10/19, 5:46 PM - Ricky: ^
7/10/19, 5:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: High stakes baby
7/10/19, 5:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: Realistically I’d be down for Facebook
7/10/19, 5:47 PM - Alex Starr: I won’t be able to make it
7/10/19, 5:47 PM - Alex Starr: But will enjoy seeing videos
7/10/19, 5:49 PM - Parker: ^
7/10/19, 5:50 PM - Alex Starr: Winner should pick the song
7/10/19, 5:55 PM - Alex Starr: Looking forward to Tim doing karaoke through all 7 minutes of closer by nine inch nails
7/10/19, 6:17 PM - Ricky: Lol
7/10/19, 6:17 PM - Ricky: I’ll do a tic toc of my posting on FB and eating a large amount of hot sauce
7/10/19, 6:21 PM - Alex Starr: Pretty sure it has to be either karaoke or lip syncing...
7/10/19, 6:21 PM - Alex Starr: For tiktok? Or am I confused on the concept
7/10/19, 6:21 PM - Parker: no i think it can be any video
7/10/19, 6:21 PM - Alex Starr: My tiktok knowledge consists of a 20 second google search
7/10/19, 6:21 PM - Parker: tiktoks can be like vines
7/10/19, 6:21 PM - Alex Starr: Thought it was a lip sync app
7/10/19, 6:21 PM - Parker: longer vines

What little information we have about the old times, the pittance of data which the Butlerians left us, Korba has brought it for you. Start with the Genghis Khan.' 'Ghenghis . . . Khan? Was he of the Sardaukar, m'Lord?' 'Oh, long before that. He killed . . . perhaps four million.' 'He must've had formidable weaponry to kill that many, Sire. Lasbeams, perhaps, or . . .' 'He didn't kill them himself, Stil. He killed the way I kill, by sending out his legions. There's another emperor I want you to note in passing--a Hitler. He killed more than six million. Pretty good for those days.' 'Killed . . . by his legions?' Stilgar asked. 'Yes.' 'Not very impressive statistics, m'Lord

7/26/19, 7:43 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah
7/26/19, 8:01 PM - Alex Starr: Oh.  I hope Collin doesn’t have much of a gag reflex.
7/26/19, 8:01 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz he’ll have part of a dump in his mouth pretty soon
7/26/19, 8:05 PM - Collin Hurst: Wait what dump is coming to Arnold?

7/26/19, 8:41 PM - Matt Casali: No, juj is
7/26/19, 8:49 PM - Parker: you should really ask her how she got that nickname
7/26/19, 9:10 PM - Matt Casali: I mean I know and I've told you guys, but I think you all just like to make jokes about it anyway
7/26/19, 9:10 PM - Collin Hurst: I don't remember you telling me
7/26/19, 9:11 PM - Collin Hurst: Can you jog my mem
7/26/19, 9:11 PM - Parker: yeah wait i don’t either
7/26/19, 9:13 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t either
7/26/19, 9:13 PM - Alex Starr: I’m going with cruelest name for an orphan ever
7/26/19, 9:17 PM - Matt Casali: It came from her friends calling her dumpling
7/26/19, 9:18 PM - Alex Starr: It was much funnier in my head
7/26/19, 9:18 PM - Parker: Nooo i mean juj
7/26/19, 9:18 PM - Collin Hurst: Ohhhh
7/26/19, 9:18 PM - Alex Starr: That too
7/26/19, 9:18 PM - Collin Hurst: Now when I think of dump I can think of a dumpling and not a sack of shit
7/26/19, 9:18 PM - Parker: i think you’ve told us dump before
7/26/19, 9:19 PM - Parker: hahah exactly
7/26/19, 9:19 PM - Ricky: Wtf haha

7/26/19, 9:20 PM - Alex Starr: Dump?
7/26/19, 9:20 PM - Ricky: Dump?
7/26/19, 9:20 PM - Ricky: At the most it’s just a poop
7/26/19, 9:20 PM - Ricky: Why a sack?
7/26/19, 9:20 PM - Alex Starr: Collin wouldn’t let uncovered poop down his throat
7/26/19, 9:21 PM - Parker: i believe he hyperbolized for comedic effect
7/26/19, 9:21 PM - Matt Casali: Idk juj is just a random nickname haha
7/26/19, 9:23 PM - Ricky: It’s like why we call u Alex instead of Alexander, which I once again vote we should call you
7/26/19, 9:24 PM - Alex Starr: I’m firmly against that
7/26/19, 10:30 PM - Parker: lol

8/2/19, 2:55 PM - Alex Starr: Exactly.  Then time for me to train my hopefully less hungover neural net
8/2/19, 2:55 PM - Alex Starr: And do some hungover math
8/2/19, 2:56 PM - Vaughn: Haha thats the spirit
8/2/19, 2:56 PM - Collin Hurst: I get it
8/2/19, 2:56 PM - Alex Starr: Well played
8/2/19, 2:56 PM - Vaughn: Youre fine with leaving at 11:30 collinoscopy?
8/2/19, 2:57 PM - Alex Starr: Cough twice if yes
8/2/19, 2:57 PM - Collin Hurst: I guessssssssssss
8/2/19, 2:57 PM - Vaughn: I have games on my phone
8/2/19, 2:57 PM - Alex Starr: I mean it’s a 90 minute difference
8/2/19, 2:57 PM - Alex Starr: And you can nap in the car
8/2/19, 2:57 PM - Collin Hurst: I'd like to stay longer but if there's no space in the other car I don't really have a choice lol
8/2/19, 2:58 PM - Ricky: Your choice is to drive another car haha
8/2/19, 2:58 PM - Alex Starr: Right but you’d only stay 90 more minutes.  Cuz they have dinner at 5:30 and it’s a 4 hour drive
8/2/19, 2:58 PM - Collin Hurst: Do you have startup simulator deluxe 13.0.12 with the SF pack
8/2/19, 2:58 PM - Ricky: Or switch with Matt and juj
8/2/19, 2:58 PM - Ricky: If you drive slow
8/2/19, 2:59 PM - Collin Hurst: Y-no
8/2/19, 3:00 PM - Alex Starr: Eh I bet it’ll be about 4 even if you drive fast
8/2/19, 3:01 PM - Collin Hurst: Just dont stop for egg sandwiches at subway
8/2/19, 3:01 PM - Alex Starr: That sounds like the worst idea possibly ever
8/2/19, 3:03 PM - Ricky: Google maps says we could do it in 2hours 4 mins
8/2/19, 3:03 PM - Alex Starr: What
8/2/19, 3:03 PM - Ricky: Correction 2 hours 30 mins
8/2/19, 3:04 PM - Alex Starr: Maybe I mapped the wrong Arnold?
8/2/19, 3:04 PM - Alex Starr: There’s also a shit ton of traffic rn
8/2/19, 3:04 PM - Ricky: Well yeah right now
8/2/19, 3:04 PM - Ricky: But this is the worst possible time of the week
8/2/19, 3:04 PM - Ricky: Saturday morning there is 0 traffic
8/2/19, 3:04 PM - Alex Starr: Damn straight
8/2/19, 3:04 PM - Ricky: Friday at 3 pm 😂
8/2/19, 3:05 PM - Alex Starr: Last time we hit crazy traffic
8/2/19, 3:05 PM - Alex Starr: It took us 30 minutes to make 1 left turn
8/2/19, 3:05 PM - Alex Starr: And 5 seconds to make 1 left turn into traffic
8/2/19, 3:06 PM - Ricky: That’s prob cuz u went on a Friday evening hahah
8/2/19, 3:06 PM - Alex Starr: Yes we did
8/2/19, 3:08 PM - Ricky: well as long as no one crashes, i promise a better travel experience
8/2/19, 3:09 PM - Alex Starr: It was fine haha.  Good memory
8/2/19, 3:14 PM - Ricky: better than me hitting ur nut with a water bottle?
8/2/19, 3:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: This happened
8/2/19, 3:17 PM - Collin Hurst: Wait I think I remember was I in that car
8/2/19, 3:17 PM - Collin Hurst: Oh yes I was
8/2/19, 3:18 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah that was ass
8/2/19, 3:30 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah Collin me Jason
8/2/19, 7:39 PM - Matt Casali: Let's get some pizza this weekend
8/2/19, 7:39 PM - Matt Casali: Or I can make pizza
8/2/19, 7:39 PM - Alex Starr: I think bbq seems to be the consensus
8/2/19, 7:40 PM - Matt Casali: What if we put bbq chicken on a pizza??
8/2/19, 7:40 PM - Ricky: Hahaha
8/2/19, 7:41 PM - Alex Starr: It would still be a pizza and be meh
8/2/19, 7:41 PM - Ricky: How bout we get pizza for lunch matty
8/2/19, 7:41 PM - Ricky: And then we can do bbq stuff for dinner
8/2/19, 7:41 PM - Ricky: How do we wanna get the food?
8/2/19, 7:41 PM - Alex Starr: Has pizza reached Arnold?
8/2/19, 7:41 PM - Ricky: Do we wanna meet in the morning? Or can pple go tonight?
8/2/19, 7:42 PM - Matt Casali: What are we having with the chicken?
8/2/19, 7:43 PM - Alex Starr: I’m not even sure we are having chicken, but you usually roast vegetables in with it
8/2/19, 7:44 PM - Alex Starr: Isn’t Stephanie or someone vegetarian?
8/2/19, 7:44 PM - Ricky: I don’t think so
8/2/19, 7:44 PM - Ricky: Unless juj
8/2/19, 7:44 PM - Ricky: And grace was gonna make some pasta
8/2/19, 7:44 PM - Ricky: And we could have veggies and / or salad
8/2/19, 7:45 PM - Matt Casali: Juj isn't
8/2/19, 7:45 PM - Matt Casali: Pasta sounds good!
8/2/19, 7:45 PM - Matt Casali: Also, collin, you should go to curry up now while you're in sf and tell me how you like it
8/2/19, 7:45 PM - Matt Casali: It looks super good
8/2/19, 7:57 PM - Alex Starr: Matt are you suggesting pizza cuz sarafina’s italian kitchen is the #1 italian restaurant in Arnold? If yes bravo
8/2/19, 7:58 PM - Matt Casali: Haha no, I wish I was though
8/2/19, 7:58 PM - Matt Casali: But I think I have my case for why we should get pizza at least once
8/2/19, 7:59 PM - Alex Starr: What’s the case?
8/2/19, 7:59 PM - Alex Starr: When I think Arnold I don’t think pizza
8/2/19, 7:59 PM - Alex Starr: I think picking buckshot out of squirrel stew
8/2/19, 8:01 PM - Matt Casali: Only the name
8/2/19, 8:01 PM - Matt Casali: And that pizza sounds like a good idea
8/2/19, 8:01 PM - Matt Casali: I'm also totally open to making pizza for everyone
8/2/19, 8:03 PM - Collin Hurst: Go with me you won't
8/2/19, 8:03 PM - Matt Casali: I most definitely will
8/2/19, 8:04 PM - Ricky: It is good
8/2/19, 8:05 PM - Alex Starr: The title makes me not want to go
8/2/19, 8:08 PM - Alex Starr: Tho it looks really good
8/2/19, 8:12 PM - Darren: Would require you to not be in santa cruz

8/13/19, 4:24 PM - Alex Starr: It’s not a biology book if dropping it on someone wouldn’t kill them?
8/13/19, 4:50 PM - Collin Hurst: If, according to Kanye West, one good girl is worth a thousand bitches, and if, according to Lil Wayne, bitches come a dime a dozen, does that mean one good girl is worth $8.33?
Well, $8.35 in Canada.
In Thailand, $8.33 is about 275 Baht. 275 Baht will get you a skanky hooker in a Thai brothel. If you want a really good hooker, it'll cost you at least 2000 Baht, or about $61.00. So in Thailand a good woman is worth $61.00 or $732 a dozen.
Yes. However to further this, according to 2Pac Mo' Money= Mo' Bitches
If you divide out Mo', you will see that money=bitches
Therefore, 1000 moneys= one good girl.
To extrapolate further, diving with respect to "money" yields 1 money = $0.00833 This changes everything, because money isn't worth hardly anything.
True. A linear relationship between money and bitches means the equation relating money to bitches is in the form of y=ax+b, where x is money and y is bitches. Consulting the Lil Wayne theorem, if 12 bitches is worth $0.10, then one bitch is $0.0083. Therefore we know that the equation 1=a(.0083)+b must hold true and so must 12=a(.1)+b. To find the equation relating money to bitches must have "a" and "b" values which satisfy the two previous equations. Since "Mo'" implies a positive linear relation, we know "a" must be positive. I have done the math for you and found that a=119.96 and b=.0043. So, (Bitches)=119.96(Money) + .0043. To find the number of good girls you get from an amount of money, simply divide the number of bitches by 1000 (because of the Kanye West Theorem).
No but biggie said mo' money= mo' problems so money=problems and since mo' money mo' bitches, we can see that bitches=problems
Well one must first consult the "50 Cent Law": "Mo' Money, Mo' Problems". Here we see that the amount of money is proportionate to the number of problems. Then one must factor one of the basic rules of the "The Carter Theorem" : "I got 99 problem but a bitch ain't one". Here we see that without a "bitch" the average person will have exactly 99 problems.
Therefore the formula must be applied:
(current amount of money) (8.33) / ln[(Problems100-1 ) * (current amount of money)]bitches = worth of bitch
Unfortunately this formula only tells us the value "a bitch" which as we know is only worth one monies
Therefore you must apply
[(worth of bitch) * (problems) * (money-8.33)] + 1 / 1000 = The value of a good girl
Hope this helps
Yeah. No.
That's not how math works.
2pac was merely stating that the derivative of Money in terms of Bitches is strictly positive. More-over, he skipped a lot of steps in his proof and never formally published the full version. I bet you believed Fermat's margins really were too small as well, right?
Imperial bitches is actually a unit of weight. An imperial bitch is ~111.1111111112 pounds.
Theres one fundamental law of math that Lil'Wayne forgot to include in his calculations. We have to follow the law of "bitches ain't shit" theorized by doctor dre himself.
With that principal included we can work out that if bitches aint shit, and a good girl is worth 1,000 bitches, a good girl is still not worth shit.
You're forgetting that Jay-Z published his paper on the "Money Ain't A Thang" theory. Therefore if bitches aren't worth shit then bitches aren't money and so therefore they ARE, in fact, a "Thang".
Is that the transitive property of bitches?
Is it possible that for every bitch, there is an equal and opposite good girl? That doesn't make sense though because kanye said a good girl is worth one thousand bitches. The economics don't make sense.
Newton or kanye is wrong. They cannot both apply their laws to bitches
I think the important part here is, are we assuming that there is 1 good girl for every 1000 bitches. This is a very scary thought. 1/1000 females is a good girl and the other 999 are bitches.
To me this would make my $8.33 a very good investment. I paid at least $3000 for my wife's wedding ring. Could I have bought 360 good girls in stead of 1 good girl? B/c I can't help but feel like I have overpaid for my good girl
8/13/19, 4:52 PM - +44 7869 257485: There was nothing I needed more in the very moment than that

8/14/19, 4:28 PM - Collin Hurst: I'm down
8/14/19, 4:28 PM - Collin Hurst: Long answer yes?
8/14/19, 4:31 PM - Alex Starr: Long answer was league manager can veto trades, so if you want to buy in two teams and aren’t league manager, yes
8/14/19, 4:33 PM - Collin Hurst: Oh ok dangit
8/14/19, 4:38 PM - Vaughn: Is matt ko in or what?

8/17/19, 4:29 PM - Tim Ko: Probably but there is a very slight chance I did bad enough on the reading where I would have to retake lol
8/17/19, 4:31 PM - +44 7869 257485: dang
8/17/19, 4:31 PM - +44 7869 257485: When do u get the results back

8/17/19, 4:33 PM - Tim Ko: So I would have to wait till January before I could retake lol
8/17/19, 4:33 PM - Tim Ko: Which would suck major ass
8/17/19, 4:34 PM - Tim Ko: But I’m 80% sure I didn’t massively fail the reading section haha, didn’t do great but don’t think I completely bomb it
8/17/19, 5:17 PM - Alex Starr: Nice.
8/17/19, 5:17 PM - Alex Starr: Or at least 80% nice

8/17/19, 10:35 PM - Tim Ko: Traffic starts at 3
8/17/19, 10:35 PM - Alex Starr: Right but it gets crazy at 5
8/17/19, 10:35 PM - Tim Ko: I think we just accept the traffic out of the bay but no traffic as we head into LA
8/17/19, 10:35 PM - Alex Starr: And we need to wait til then for Jason
8/17/19, 10:36 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah, but its still kinda bad at 3
8/17/19, 10:36 PM - Tim Ko: So there’s nothing we can rlly do
8/17/19, 10:36 PM - Tim Ko: I think it’s good that we avoid the LA traffic tho
8/17/19, 10:37 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah agreed.

8/19/19, 4:58 PM - Alex Starr: I figured.  Seems like you’re up for anything with at least two legs.
8/19/19, 5:02 PM - Collin Hurst: Woah woah woah
8/19/19, 5:02 PM - Collin Hurst: Who said I didn't like amputees
8/19/19, 5:04 PM - Alex Starr: I was more trying to imply you’re down for things with four legs, but you’re right that’s my bad
8/19/19, 5:08 PM - Alex Starr: Or an extraordinarily large centipede
8/19/19, 5:16 PM - Tim Ko: _It was a valiant effort but Starr’s comeback falls short as Hurst’s 8th inning homerun proves too much to overcome_
8/19/19, 5:17 PM - Alex Starr: Fuck you
8/19/19, 5:18 PM - Ricky: Hahaha
8/19/19, 5:44 PM - Collin Hurst: Who's for dinner tn!?

8/19/19, 6:10 PM - Vaughn: Who knows
8/19/19, 6:11 PM - Vaughn: Is that why youre scared?
8/19/19, 6:14 PM - Alex Starr: Matt in SC, Ricky with fam, not me, Parker in Spain, Jason mia, Darren no confirmation either way, idk about Tim, leaving....
8/19/19, 6:18 PM - Ricky: Haha yeah is Jason still alive?
8/19/19, 6:18 PM - Alex Starr: Missing in action presumed dead

8/19/19, 7:40 PM - Collin Hurst: Crap my dad found my Reddit account
8/19/19, 7:40 PM - Collin Hurst: Pinche wei
8/19/19, 7:41 PM - Alex Starr: And that’s bad because....
8/19/19, 7:41 PM - Vaughn: Ouch
8/19/19, 7:41 PM - Vaughn: All those weird porn comments
8/19/19, 7:41 PM - Alex Starr: Why actually tho
8/19/19, 7:43 PM - Vaughn: Lots of people keep their reddit accounts secret cause they post personal stories and the subbreddits they follow say a lot about them
8/19/19, 7:43 PM - Alex Starr: Ah that makes sense.  What does Collins say about him?
8/19/19, 7:44 PM - Vaughn: Idk, i dont know his account name
8/19/19, 7:44 PM - Alex Starr: Mine says “I made it two days ago and randomly joined r/fantasy to make one bad joke”
8/19/19, 7:44 PM - Vaughn: Hahahaha
8/19/19, 7:44 PM - Collin Hurst: Just personal stories and stuff
8/19/19, 7:44 PM - Collin Hurst: Resit is anonymous that's that's one great thing about it
8/19/19, 7:45 PM - Alex Starr: Now I really want to find ur reddit account
8/19/19, 7:45 PM - Alex Starr: What’s ur username?
8/19/19, 7:45 PM - Collin Hurst: It's not that crazy
8/19/19, 7:45 PM - Alex Starr: Kidding of course
8/19/19, 7:46 PM - Alex Starr: I figured it’s just that never even occurred to me.
8/19/19, 7:46 PM - Collin Hurst: Never
8/19/19, 7:46 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah it's just nice to contribute to the internet society without it being tied back to you
8/19/19, 7:47 PM - Collin Hurst: Although if someone stalked my account and knew me they would probably find out I was tied to that account
8/19/19, 7:47 PM - Collin Hurst: But not vice versa luckily
8/19/19, 7:47 PM - Tim Ko: Yup exactly
8/19/19, 7:48 PM - Alex Starr: Wow surprised that one wasn’t taken
8/19/19, 7:48 PM - Tim Ko: Damn haha
8/19/19, 7:48 PM - Alex Starr: Also something really shitty about it
8/19/19, 7:49 PM - Alex Starr: Damn now I really wanna see everyone’s reddit history
8/19/19, 7:49 PM - Tim Ko: Recently someone from Berkeley found my reddit account and even tho I just post and comment on A’s related stuff, I felt like my privacy was violated lol
8/19/19, 7:50 PM - Tim Ko: *a friend from Berkeley
8/19/19, 7:50 PM - Vaughn: Idk collin someone might be able to track you down from your reddit account
8/19/19, 7:50 PM - Collin Hurst: They definitely could
8/19/19, 7:50 PM - Vaughn: Theyd know your a transfer at sc
8/19/19, 7:50 PM - Collin Hurst: But they could from fb too
8/19/19, 7:51 PM - Collin Hurst: I was saying they can
8/19/19, 7:51 PM - Vaughn: Oh yeah
8/19/19, 7:52 PM - Alex Starr: Alright I shared my reddit history who’s next
8/19/19, 7:52 PM - Alex Starr: And Tim did too
8/19/19, 7:53 PM - Alex Starr: His description had less detail, tho admittedly he’s probably made more comments
8/19/19, 7:53 PM - Vaughn: Id rather give you my ssn
8/19/19, 7:53 PM - Darren: I made 2 posts about indieoutreach and r/gamedev and r/indiedev and got 160 karma
8/19/19, 7:53 PM - Vaughn: Karma whore
8/19/19, 7:53 PM - Darren: And now when I browse Reddit I don't do it logged in
8/19/19, 7:54 PM - Alex Starr: I’m still trying to wrap my head around it
8/19/19, 7:55 PM - Matt Casali: I really thought I found Collin from a post on r/ucsc but instead just found someone that's his blood brother
8/19/19, 7:55 PM - Collin Hurst: I also don't want you guys to see my attempts at getting karma but only getting like 5 upvotes
8/19/19, 7:56 PM - Matt Casali: Compsci guy who posted on cod subreddits, climbing circle jerk and other Collin-y stuff
8/19/19, 7:56 PM - Alex Starr: No way.  I’ll take it
8/19/19, 7:57 PM - Darren: That sounds like a generic comp sci student at ucsc
8/19/19, 7:58 PM - Vaughn: Write a script that pulls and matches all the commenters on r/climbing r/ucsc and r/bumpyknees and ding ding ding
8/19/19, 7:58 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah maybe
8/19/19, 7:59 PM - Alex Starr: If I wasn’t lazy I might
8/19/19, 8:00 PM - Alex Starr: The only thing preventing worldwide destruction is everyone’s laziness
8/19/19, 8:03 PM - Matt Casali: Edgy
8/19/19, 8:06 PM - Alex Starr: I’m like a polytope in 1000D
8/19/19, 8:06 PM - Darren: r/im14andthisisdeep
8/19/19, 8:09 PM - Tim Ko: I follow u darren!

8/19/19, 8:11 PM - Alex Starr: It’s a quote

8/20/19, 6:09 AM - +44 7869 257485: Ayyy crater lake is sick! Have fun jieson
8/20/19, 7:26 AM - Ricky: Yooooo my refit history is exclusively looking up r/mlbstreams and that one time Tim told me to check out the rays subreddit when we beat them haha
8/20/19, 7:26 AM - Ricky: Reddit
8/20/19, 9:02 AM - Alex Starr: R we doing dinner tonight or no?

8/20/19, 9:13 AM - Alex Starr: 7 works.
8/20/19, 9:14 AM - Alex Starr: I’m gonna be in Berkeley helping my sister move in for most of the day
8/20/19, 9:20 AM - +44 7869 257485: Idk if you said it or not, but I didn’t know Kayla was going to Berkeley that’s dope!!
8/20/19, 9:32 AM - Tim Ko: Ayyy
8/20/19, 9:32 AM - Tim Ko: What unit is she living in?
8/20/19, 10:57 AM - Matt Casali: @Collin, Vaughn what time should I be in san Jose?
8/20/19, 10:57 AM - Matt Casali: I can meet you at diridion station
8/20/19, 11:07 AM - Collin Hurst: 11:30 would be good
8/20/19, 12:00 PM - Matt Casali: Sounds good
8/20/19, 1:32 PM - Darren: https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/08/20/breaking-spider-man-out-of-the-mcu-marvel-sony-cant-reach-deal
8/20/19, 1:33 PM - Darren: Sony is taking Spiderman out of the MCU
8/20/19, 1:34 PM - Matt Casali: Dicks
8/20/19, 2:01 PM - Darren: Marvel should have Tom Holland star as night monkey in all future movies
8/20/19, 2:18 PM - Jason Greenberg: That is breaking news and we are in the wrong timeline
8/20/19, 3:16 PM - Collin Hurst: Amazon rainforest on fire:( how did I not know this
8/20/19, 3:16 PM - Collin Hurst: 16th day in a row
8/20/19, 3:20 PM - Tim Ko: U didn’t hear about my mixtape?
8/20/19, 3:20 PM - Collin Hurst: 👎
8/20/19, 3:59 PM - Alex Starr: New president is absolutely horrible for the rainforest.  It’s going to be so throughly deforested
8/20/19, 11:13 PM - +44 7869 257485: I just heard about that :(((
8/20/19, 11:13 PM - +44 7869 257485: Also I didn’t hear about all the canary island fires even though that’s literally part of Spain
8/21/19, 7:58 AM - Jason Greenberg: Ricky should we bring towels?
8/21/19, 7:58 AM - Jason Greenberg: Unless you have nine of them
8/21/19, 8:13 AM - Alex Starr: I think bedding is more important.  Also, how should I pick people up tomorrow? Or will we meet at my house?
8/21/19, 8:23 AM - Jason Greenberg: We should meet at your house
8/21/19, 8:23 AM - Jason Greenberg: I may be able to get there by 2:30 instead of 3
8/21/19, 8:34 AM - Alex Starr: That would be so optimal
8/21/19, 8:35 AM - Alex Starr: K 2:15 my house.  Please please please don’t be late.  Unless ur Jason then you can be 15 minutes late.
8/21/19, 9:14 AM - Ricky: Haha yes
8/21/19, 9:15 AM - Ricky: Everyone should bring a blanket and a pillow
8/21/19, 9:15 AM - Ricky: We got lots of surfaces
8/21/19, 9:16 AM - Ricky: If u wanna bring something like an air mattress for the ground that would help
8/21/19, 9:16 AM - Ricky: But deff being a towel and swim suit and some clothes
8/21/19, 9:16 AM - Ricky: (Alex u should bring long pants for a bar or something)
8/21/19, 9:16 AM - Collin Hurst: I'll try
8/21/19, 9:16 AM - Ricky: ?
8/21/19, 9:17 AM - Vaughn: Haha called out
8/21/19, 9:18 AM - Ricky: There is only do there is no try
8/21/19, 9:18 AM - +44 7869 257485: Hahahaha
8/21/19, 9:19 AM - Jason Greenberg: Everyone bring three snacks
8/21/19, 9:25 AM - Ricky: hehe oooohhhh i like that idea haha
8/21/19, 9:29 AM - +44 7869 257485: Solely for Collin when he’s baked
8/21/19, 9:31 AM - Collin Hurst: ^
8/21/19, 9:35 AM - Matt Casali: Feed the beast
8/21/19, 9:38 AM - +44 7869 257485: COLLIN I’m gonna bring back a can of those jamón Pringle’s and I want you to kill a whole thing one night we smoke together
8/21/19, 9:40 AM - Collin Hurst: I'm down
8/21/19, 9:40 AM - Collin Hurst: I kill a whole thing without smoking lol
8/21/19, 9:42 AM - Alex Starr: Maybe it’s like a four foot tub of them
8/21/19, 9:43 AM - +44 7869 257485: They actually have those here lmao
8/21/19, 9:43 AM - +44 7869 257485: Literally the biggest thing of chips I’ve ever seen
8/21/19, 9:43 AM - +44 7869 257485: But only in original
8/21/19, 9:43 AM - Alex Starr: Damn it
8/21/19, 9:47 AM - Alex Starr: Also we should probably come up with some sort of general itinerary for Friday/Saturday
8/21/19, 9:53 AM - Jason Greenberg: Google doc?
8/21/19, 9:55 AM - Matt Casali: All I want is AYCE sushi
8/21/19, 9:56 AM - Matt Casali: As long as we get that, I think we can just figure stuff out as we go
8/21/19, 10:03 AM - Jason Greenberg: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16bs8pdYwzJPmwM86_1jmJgm1IoKJOyFwEPJ3v64qrrQ/edit?usp=sharing
8/21/19, 10:10 AM - Jason Greenberg: We should go to a comedy club in LA
8/21/19, 10:18 AM - Alex Starr: Eh
8/21/19, 10:18 AM - Matt Casali: Sounds like a lot of money
8/21/19, 10:18 AM - Collin Hurst: We should walk a red carpet
8/21/19, 10:18 AM - +44 7869 257485: Do it!!! They’re so fun!
8/21/19, 10:25 AM - Jason Greenberg: True $20 tickets plus two drink minimum
8/21/19, 10:26 AM - Collin Hurst: Less than sushi
8/21/19, 10:28 AM - Jason Greenberg: How much is sushi
8/21/19, 10:28 AM - +44 7869 257485: More than that
8/21/19, 10:30 AM - Alex Starr: Nah sushi is 28.95
8/21/19, 10:30 AM - Alex Starr: So unless drinks are cheap and taste better than sushi
8/21/19, 10:31 AM - Ricky: Yo I have seen Thomas middleditch and benshwartz live twice, deff best money I Eva spent
8/21/19, 10:31 AM - +44 7869 257485: True and LA drinks finna be a fuck ton
8/21/19, 10:31 AM - +44 7869 257485: Ohh I thought this meant included
8/21/19, 10:31 AM - +44 7869 257485: I went to a comedy club over winter break in sf and it was a ton of fun
8/21/19, 10:33 AM - Jason Greenberg: Right they won’t be
8/21/19, 10:34 AM - Alex Starr: I also just don’t like stand up much tbh, but I’m not firmly against the idea
8/21/19, 10:37 AM - Tim Ko: Uhhh it’s my last day of work so ok if I get there at 3?
8/21/19, 10:37 AM - Alex Starr: They also might check id somewhat closely
8/21/19, 10:37 AM - Alex Starr: I guess.  Means traffic will be much worse
8/21/19, 10:37 AM - Tim Ko: Cuz that’s what I told the ppl in the la
8/21/19, 10:37 AM - Tim Ko: Lab
8/21/19, 10:37 AM - Tim Ko: Ya srry about that
8/21/19, 10:37 AM - Tim Ko: I will update u
8/21/19, 10:38 AM - Alex Starr: But be there actually at or before 3.
8/21/19, 10:38 AM - Tim Ko: Yes, most likely I can get there before 3 but I’m not certain
8/21/19, 10:38 AM - Tim Ko: But 3 is the latest I will get there
8/21/19, 12:25 PM - Alex Starr: Sounds good
8/21/19, 12:27 PM - Alex Starr: Should I bring switch and/or controllers?
8/21/19, 12:31 PM - Matt Casali: I was thinking about that and maybe not?
8/21/19, 12:33 PM - Collin Hurst: I think it would be ok but in moderation for sure
8/21/19, 12:33 PM - Collin Hurst: It would be a bummer to miss out on a Smashed smash opp with 8 people
8/21/19, 12:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’m in favor of that
8/21/19, 12:37 PM - Matt Casali: Yes, but is that even possible?
8/21/19, 12:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yes
8/21/19, 12:39 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah I guess you're right haha
8/21/19, 12:41 PM - Matt Casali: But we do have a tendency to overdo it sometimes when it comes along with us
8/21/19, 12:41 PM - Matt Casali: Just don't want it to be that kind of trip
8/21/19, 12:42 PM - Collin Hurst: I think we'll be fine
8/21/19, 12:42 PM - Collin Hurst: I haven't played smash with y'all in a while
8/21/19, 12:45 PM - Alex Starr: It won’t.  I don’t think anyone is as into smash as they were in the past, I’m certainly not.
8/21/19, 12:46 PM - Alex Starr: Ricky how is ur kitchen? Could be fun to cook a meal at your house and eat out the other night.
8/21/19, 12:48 PM - Alex Starr: I’m thinking Friday, beach plus cook at home/board game/smash then party.  Then Saturday, Hollywood hike, some other activity in LA, late sushi (AYCE or otherwise) and then play that night by ear.
8/21/19, 12:50 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah we'll figure it out
8/21/19, 12:51 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t like the sound of that
8/21/19, 12:51 PM - Vaughn: Sounds perfect to me!
8/21/19, 12:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: This is a good plan
8/21/19, 1:02 PM - Alex Starr: 3/8 is a majority I’m locking it in
8/21/19, 1:02 PM - +44 7869 257485: Eat dat pussay babbyyyy
8/21/19, 1:03 PM - Alex Starr: I feel like baaaaaby is a better spelling
8/21/19, 1:03 PM - Alex Starr: But that’s nitpicking you nailed it
8/21/19, 1:05 PM - Matt Casali: The yyy is definitely what needs to be emphasized
8/21/19, 1:05 PM - Collin Hurst: Make that 4/8 I'm in
8/21/19, 1:06 PM - Alex Starr: Damn that’s like 95%
8/21/19, 1:06 PM - Collin Hurst: Assuming I don't get injured climbing this

8/22/19, 11:27 AM - Darren: From memory, the Getty had a cool ass building with some lackluster art
8/22/19, 11:30 AM - Matt Casali: That's what it looks like haha
8/22/19, 11:30 AM - Matt Casali: Cool gardens too maybe?
8/22/19, 11:30 AM - Darren: It had one cool circular garden, but it was pretty small
8/22/19, 11:31 AM - Matt Casali: Hmm
8/22/19, 11:31 AM - Ricky: there is also LACMA
8/22/19, 11:31 AM - Matt Casali: Well we can talk about it later, but it could be cool to visit
8/22/19, 11:31 AM - Matt Casali: What is this?
8/22/19, 11:32 AM - Ricky: Los Angeles clda; of Modern Art
8/22/19, 11:32 AM - Ricky: place with all the light poles that people take instas with
8/22/19, 11:33 AM - Darren: Getty has a cool tram to get from the parking lot to the building

8/22/19, 11:33 AM - Matt Casali: I'd be down to check it out
8/22/19, 11:34 AM - Matt Casali: But yeah it could be cool to go to the getty if you've never been
8/22/19, 11:47 AM - Alex Starr: Is there a less modern art museum?
8/22/19, 11:48 AM - Matt Casali: For a less fun time?
8/22/19, 11:55 AM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
8/22/19, 12:21 PM - Alex Starr: Sticking with the buzzkill theme, fun fact by far the primary cause of this and Amazon deforestation in general is cattle ranching.
8/22/19, 12:22 PM - Alex Starr: About 70% in fact
8/22/19, 12:22 PM - Matt Casali: Wowee
8/22/19, 12:22 PM - Matt Casali: Emissions and space?
8/22/19, 12:22 PM - Alex Starr: Idk about emissions but that’s just space
8/22/19, 12:23 PM - Alex Starr: And emissions are presumably worse unless they are using the other deforested land to drive buses in circles
8/22/19, 12:24 PM - Matt Casali: Its brazil, who knows
8/22/19, 12:25 PM - Alex Starr: That’s fair
8/22/19, 12:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: article?
8/22/19, 12:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: jc
8/22/19, 12:30 PM - Alex Starr: https://www.google.com/amp/s/rainforests.mongabay.com/amazon/amazon_destruction.html
8/22/19, 12:30 PM - Alex Starr: Just a random search
8/22/19, 12:31 PM - Alex Starr: I kinda assumed it was semi-common knowledge
8/22/19, 12:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: No I didn't know
8/22/19, 1:06 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah it’s pretty devastating
8/22/19, 1:06 PM - Alex Starr: Agriculture plus deforestation accounts for 23% of greenhouse gas emissions and Amazon clearing plus cattle is a huge chunk of that
8/22/19, 1:46 PM - Alex Starr: And it’s slash and burn so it releases extra chemicals and the soil gets destroyed so reforestation is much slower
8/22/19, 3:16 PM - Matt Casali: Ricky it's looking like we're not gonna get there in time for me to join you for your little's talk
8/22/19, 3:16 PM - Matt Casali: I think we're getting there around 7:30

8/29/19, 2:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ha
8/29/19, 2:12 PM - Alex Starr: Doesn’t it end with him going outside and dying horribly cuz he’s immunodeficient?
8/29/19, 2:14 PM - Alex Starr: Then his dad watches his son die.  That seems much darker.
8/29/19, 3:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: https://youtu.be/QYaH5nU1Ls0
8/29/19, 3:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: In other dead kid jokes

8/29/19, 5:49 PM - +44 7869 257485: ooooOooo
8/29/19, 10:16 PM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
8/29/19, 10:16 PM - Collin Hurst: Ok Mark I see u
8/29/19, 10:43 PM - Tim Ko: Damn
8/29/19, 10:43 PM - Tim Ko: He flexin
8/29/19, 11:02 PM - Collin Hurst: HUGE flex
8/29/19, 11:03 PM - Collin Hurst: He only used 4 words and let the news do the rest
8/29/19, 11:07 PM - Tim Ko: Like he might as well have whipped it out instead
8/29/19, 11:08 PM - Darren: Is he from splunk or signalfx?
8/29/19, 11:09 PM - Collin Hurst: Look at the title under his name haha
8/29/19, 11:09 PM - Darren: Oho
8/29/19, 11:09 PM - Collin Hurst: Yep
8/29/19, 11:10 PM - Collin Hurst: Cya in Hawaii
8/29/19, 11:29 PM - Tim Ko: So how much money will he be getting from the purchase?
8/29/19, 11:29 PM - Tim Ko: Like is he a multimillionaire now
8/29/19, 11:29 PM - Tim Ko: We talking about Juan Pierre type money or buster posey type money
8/29/19, 11:32 PM - Darren: Idk how much either of them get payed
8/29/19, 11:35 PM - Tim Ko: 3 million a year vs 24 million a year
8/29/19, 11:36 PM - Darren: I assume he's gonna get sub 20M because he's only been there for 1.5 years, they got bought for ~1b, and signalfx had 178m in funding up to this point and the majority of that is gonna go to investor payouts
8/29/19, 11:37 PM - Darren: He also doesn't get that money until he works at splunk long enough for his money to vest, so that's usually 2-4 years
8/29/19, 11:37 PM - Darren: Either way, a lot of money
8/29/19, 11:38 PM - Tim Ko: Ahh I see
8/29/19, 11:38 PM - Tim Ko: So basically he kinda hit the jackpot by when he joined this company 1.5 yrs ago
8/29/19, 11:39 PM - Darren: Yeah
8/29/19, 11:39 PM - Tim Ko: Damn that’s sick. I remember tommy telling me like 5 yrs ago that his dad jumps from company to company as a cfo
8/29/19, 11:40 PM - Darren: Tho he probably helped them make a ton of financial progress in the past year and half, especially in the process of getting their financials ready for an acquisition
8/29/19, 11:40 PM - Tim Ko: Ah I see, so also a great situation for him to help the company grow
8/29/19, 11:40 PM - Darren: Its a good gig if you can get it, that's for sure
8/29/19, 11:42 PM - Tim Ko: For sure
8/29/19, 11:42 PM - Tim Ko: Well he prob ain’t living in MV anymore
8/29/19, 11:42 PM - Tim Ko: Made it to the hills
8/29/19, 11:42 PM - Tim Ko: And jack Resnick can watch all the porn he wants in school
8/29/19, 11:42 PM - Darren: Yeah, CFO is one of those positions that change a lot in companies as they scale. Like a series A startup might not need an experienced CFO (or need one at all), but if you're preparing for a big event like an acquisition or serious fund raising you will probably try to switch out your current CFO for a better model (and then switch them out when things go south)
8/29/19, 11:45 PM - Tim Ko: I see, wow this is very interesting stuff
8/30/19, 1:13 AM - +44 7869 257485: Finance gang

8/30/19, 2:55 PM - +44 7869 257485: First games are this upcoming week
8/30/19, 4:03 PM - Alex Starr: No the draft is Sunday at 6:30 so you have to register at least an hour before that

8/30/19, 6:58 PM - Alex Starr: Idk
8/30/19, 6:59 PM - Alex Starr: What time works for you?
8/30/19, 7:01 PM - +44 7869 257485: It’s not the end of the world that’s just 3:30am here haha
8/30/19, 7:01 PM - +44 7869 257485: I could do 6:30 tomorrow!! Bc I’ll be up watching the Oregon game
8/30/19, 7:02 PM - +44 7869 257485: But if that works for the majority then it’s np
8/30/19, 7:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha
8/30/19, 7:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: Well you’d be dedicated
8/30/19, 7:46 PM - Alex Starr: Ah well that’s not ideal.  Would Sunday at 3:30 be better?
8/30/19, 7:46 PM - Alex Starr: Does Sunday at 3:30 work for everyone?
8/30/19, 7:53 PM - Collin Hurst: Let's talk in fantasy chat

8/31/19, 10:17 PM - Ricky: Tim! Send the link!
8/31/19, 10:47 PM - Tim Ko: Oh yeah! Haha aight
8/31/19, 10:50 PM - +44 7869 257485: Fucken oregon
8/31/19, 10:50 PM - +44 7869 257485: God damn it
8/31/19, 10:50 PM - +44 7869 257485: Another season of this shit
8/31/19, 10:50 PM - +44 7869 257485: ^!!!
8/31/19, 10:52 PM - Tim Ko: I saw the final score :(
8/31/19, 10:52 PM - Tim Ko: I can’t get it on mobile lol, gotta download it off desktop
8/31/19, 10:56 PM - Tim Ko: <Media omitted>
8/31/19, 10:56 PM - Tim Ko: Here it is!
8/31/19, 10:57 PM - Tim Ko: I helped with figure 4
9/1/19, 7:09 AM - Alex Starr: It’s a cool paper.  So you did the staining/imaging? Did u only work on this project this summer or previous summers as well?
9/1/19, 7:10 AM - Alex Starr: Also what was the work flow for the staining plus imaging?
9/1/19, 7:30 AM - Alex Starr: And did u have to do the mouse stuff?
9/1/19, 8:57 AM - Tim Ko: Thx! Yeah I did staining/imaging. This was a project I only worked on last summer
9/1/19, 9:00 AM - Tim Ko: Uhh the for that part the tumor cells were already cultured and all I had to do was incubate them with the probe and then add the mitochondria and lysosome trackers. Then we put them under a microscope connected to a computer to view them
9/1/19, 9:00 AM - Tim Ko: And no I didn’t do any of the mouse stuff
9/1/19, 9:02 AM - Tim Ko: I also did some of the cytotoxicity assay
9/1/19, 9:09 AM - Alex Starr: Did u use imageJ to analyze?
9/1/19, 9:26 AM - +44 7869 257485: I’ll read it when I have a chance Tim but that’s so dope!!
9/1/19, 9:36 AM - Tim Ko: I don’t really remember the name of the software but that sounds about right haha
9/1/19, 9:37 AM - Tim Ko: Ayy thx!!
9/1/19, 9:40 AM - Alex Starr: Ya I read that the paper used it, I was just wondering if you did the image analysis
9/1/19, 9:57 AM - +44 7869 257485: Ok I started reading it but understand almost none of it hahaha
9/1/19, 9:57 AM - +44 7869 257485: Can u explain in dumbed down businessman terms
9/1/19, 9:57 AM - +44 7869 257485: Bc I’m aactually interested
9/1/19, 10:04 AM - Alex Starr: Basically there is a small molecule that damages mitochondria (the powerhouse of the cell).  This damage is fairly minor, so healthy cells survive but cancer cells (which need much more active mitochondria) tend to die.  This makes it a promising cancer treatment.  Also, it is fluorescent which is really nice as it can also help probe and visualize the tumor to help diagnose. The problem with it is that it isn’t very soluble in water, so when you inject it it doesn’t move well in blood.  This paper took the molecule and attached it to HSA, which is a protein that carries many similar molecules in the blood.  They first synthesized the molecule, purified it, attached it, then tested its fluorescence (Tim did the fluorescence stuff), tested how toxic it was to tumors/regular cells in a test tube, tested how toxic it was to mice with cancer and their tumors, and tested to see what conditions would cause it to separate from HSA.  Overall, it looks promising to be used in a cocktail of other cancer drugs.  One thing I’m not clear on is what the conclusion of the fluorescence stuff was with regard to its presence in lysosomes vs. mitochondria.  Was that just to be sure it wouldn’t all get taken up and broken down by lysosomes?
9/1/19, 10:05 AM - Alex Starr: Hope that helps
9/1/19, 10:07 AM - +44 7869 257485: Ohhh yeah that makes sense haha thanks
9/1/19, 10:07 AM - +44 7869 257485: That’s cool!
9/1/19, 10:08 AM - +44 7869 257485: Is it specific to any type of cancer or just more general? And are there similar things around rn
9/1/19, 10:10 AM - Alex Starr: I didn’t get the impression it was specifically targeted, but more than likely it would work better for some cancers than others.
9/1/19, 10:13 AM - Alex Starr: Looks like nothing currently used in practice, but definitely an active area of research.  Maybe some human trials, Tim can probably tell you more
9/1/19, 10:20 AM - +44 7869 257485: Ah gotcha
9/1/19, 10:57 AM - Jason Greenberg: Helpful 👍
9/1/19, 10:57 AM - Jason Greenberg: Barry would be proud
9/1/19, 12:45 PM - Tim Ko: Haha great summary!
9/1/19, 12:47 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah, basically we wanted to compare the amount the mitochondria would take up the probe and so the lysosome would be the other place that would take the probe up a lot too. Just a way of seeing how effective or ineffective the probe was in getting to its target destination
9/1/19, 12:48 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah and the big thing about this is that it operates in the near infrared window, which has long wavelengths and allows for clearer images and deeper tissue penetration. However right now the tissue penetration is still not adequate enough to visualize deep tumors non invasively
9/1/19, 12:49 PM - Tim Ko: It’s good for mouse models cuz mice are very small
9/1/19, 12:49 PM - Tim Ko: And good for tumors that aren’t so deep in the body
9/1/19, 12:52 PM - Alex Starr: Oh weird they didn’t make a bigger deal about the IR fluorescence
9/1/19, 12:58 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah, I think cuz I think the lab published a big paper on that a couple years ago focusing on IR flourecence
9/1/19, 12:59 PM - Tim Ko: The lab kinda hit a jackpot in the IR fluorescence field and now takes a lot of things that are currently out there and applies it to IR
9/1/19, 1:00 PM - Alex Starr: Any of it in use yet? Also how deep does IR go?
9/1/19, 1:05 PM - Tim Ko: Not clinically, just preclinical ( like testing drugs in mice)
9/1/19, 1:05 PM - Tim Ko: IR goes around 5 mm
9/1/19, 1:06 PM - Tim Ko: Kinda wish I was a chemistry major cuz then I would understand the molecular interactions and development of the probes so much more lol
9/1/19, 1:07 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah but chem at Berkeley is so hard
9/1/19, 1:07 PM - Alex Starr: Plus u don’t want to do research with the md right? More treating people in underserved communities?
9/1/19, 1:21 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah that’s right
9/1/19, 1:21 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah, it just woulda been way more cool to understand the chemistry behind he probes haha
9/1/19, 1:22 PM - Alex Starr: Doing it for underserved communities is (imo) the largest impact you can make as a doctor outside of maybe MD/PhD primarily research
9/1/19, 1:23 PM - Alex Starr: Hearing about medical deserts in central/southern areas in the US, the situation there really surprised me
9/1/19, 1:24 PM - Tim Ko: Haha ayyy for sure
9/1/19, 1:24 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah, it’s crazy how much of a health disparity we have in different parts of our country
9/1/19, 1:25 PM - Tim Ko: And that’s just within our country
9/1/19, 1:26 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah I for the first 18 years assumed everywhere had Stanford quality healthcare
9/1/19, 1:26 PM - Alex Starr: Everywhere in the US at least
9/1/19, 1:28 PM - Ricky: FUCKCKCKKCKC
9/1/19, 1:28 PM - Ricky: jkl/fgasdkgjl'asdk'lg
9/1/19, 1:28 PM - Ricky: fucekn 2 walkoff homers in a row wtf
9/1/19, 1:38 PM - Tim Ko: Ahh I see haha, same
9/1/19, 1:38 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah shit man :(
9/1/19, 1:38 PM - Tim Ko: Stupid bullpen
9/1/19, 1:40 PM - Tim Ko: Bullpen should sleep on the field tonight for their atrocious performance
9/1/19, 2:32 PM - +44 7869 257485: Lol
9/1/19, 9:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: When does the week start
9/1/19, 9:43 PM - Alex Starr: What does that mean

9/1/19, 10:06 PM - Collin Hurst: ^
9/1/19, 10:06 PM - +44 7869 257485: I mean a calendar week starts on Sunday..
9/1/19, 10:06 PM - Alex Starr: God didn’t take day 1 off.  He took day 7 off.
9/1/19, 10:11 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz there couldn’t even be a day 1 until he went to work.  Checkmate atheists.
9/2/19, 7:35 AM - Jason Greenberg: For fantasy
9/2/19, 7:35 AM - Jason Greenberg: Like week 1
9/2/19, 7:49 AM - Alex Starr: Oh this week
9/2/19, 7:50 AM - Alex Starr: First game is Thursday; first full Sunday of games is the 8th, and one on Monday night.  You set ur lineup Tuesday or Wednesday; set up players you want to pick up off waivers on Tuesday and get them on Wednesday to put in
9/2/19, 7:55 AM - Jason Greenberg: Cool
9/2/19, 8:22 AM - Alex Starr: You can also propose and accept trades
9/2/19, 8:32 AM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah Tim already offered me one but I think it was mediocre
9/2/19, 8:40 AM - +44 7869 257485: Hahaha what was it
9/2/19, 8:40 AM - +44 7869 257485: Tim will probably try to take advantage of you so beware
9/2/19, 8:43 AM - Alex Starr: That’s Tim’s MO
9/2/19, 8:47 AM - Alex Starr: Also Tim didn’t sleep at our apartment last night... wonder what (or who) he was up to
9/2/19, 8:51 AM - Tim Ko: Hahaha
9/2/19, 8:51 AM - Tim Ko: Accept my trade!
9/2/19, 8:51 AM - Tim Ko: I also went home after my meeting lol

9/3/19, 3:33 PM - Ricky: Litty!
9/3/19, 3:33 PM - Ricky: Thant’s a good price!
9/3/19, 3:58 PM - Alex Starr: The fuck?
9/3/19, 3:58 PM - Alex Starr: Did someone die in there or...?
9/3/19, 3:58 PM - +44 7869 257485: Hahha
9/3/19, 3:59 PM - +44 7869 257485: Damn y’all gotta move to eugene
9/3/19, 4:15 PM - Darren: It was 1000/month, which was already unusually low
9/3/19, 4:15 PM - Matt Casali: Holy fuck
9/3/19, 4:20 PM - +44 7869 257485: That’s cray
9/3/19, 4:20 PM - +44 7869 257485: I pay 700 for mine in eugene lol

9/3/19, 4:24 PM - +44 7869 257485: I pay out of state tuition though🥵
9/3/19, 4:29 PM - Darren: Also everyone in my house is a barista at Starbucks except me, so I'm gonna be rolling in free coffee and coffee adjacent food
9/3/19, 4:29 PM - Collin Hurst: Dang baristas take back so much of those frozen foods
9/3/19, 4:42 PM - +44 7869 257485: That’s so sick omg

9/4/19, 8:34 AM - Ricky: And google saved my old IM logs as emails and holly F, it’s hard to read and funny and weird
9/5/19, 7:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: Anyone around want to hang tomorrow?
9/5/19, 7:46 PM - Collin Hurst: Ye
9/5/19, 9:33 PM - Vaughn: Ye
9/5/19, 9:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: That’s 100%
9/5/19, 9:34 PM - Vaughn: Of the cool people? Yeah
9/5/19, 9:35 PM - Alex Starr: I am possibly free depending on what my family does.  I am also in mv
9/5/19, 9:36 PM - Collin Hurst: What time? My Friday just got a lil busier
9/5/19, 9:37 PM - Alex Starr: What happened?
9/5/19, 9:38 PM - Collin Hurst: I have to be in SC from 12-6pm and then I have dinner at 7 lol
9/5/19, 9:40 PM - Alex Starr: That is rather decidedly busier
9/5/19, 9:40 PM - Alex Starr: But that’s good cuz then all the cool people are free
9/5/19, 9:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: We should play poker again
9/5/19, 9:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: For a small amount again
9/5/19, 9:41 PM - Collin Hurst: I'm down
9/5/19, 9:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yee
9/5/19, 9:41 PM - Alex Starr: Who won
9/5/19, 9:41 PM - Collin Hurst: Wow
9/5/19, 9:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: Vaughn
9/5/19, 9:41 PM - Collin Hurst: Technically
9/5/19, 9:41 PM - Alex Starr: Not too surprising haha
9/5/19, 9:42 PM - Collin Hurst: Hey I was winning until the last hand then I went hella deep cause yolo
9/5/19, 9:43 PM - Alex Starr: r/im14andthisisdeep
9/5/19, 9:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: You put the hard fiddy on the table and that was that
9/6/19, 8:01 AM - +44 7869 257485: What dates from the 12-20th can the people in town be free for a bbq at me hoose?? To christen the backyard
9/6/19, 8:02 AM - +44 7869 257485: Karli and our friend brittany are staying with me the night of the 12th on their way to eugene so I thought it might be fun to have it that day but I’m open
9/6/19, 8:03 AM - Collin Hurst: Anytime for me
9/6/19, 9:26 AM - Tim Ko: Oooo

9/7/19, 8:59 PM - Parker: It was mucho fun it went by way too fast
9/7/19, 9:00 PM - Parker: yeeeee
9/7/19, 9:00 PM - Parker: i’m excited to be home and workout again though lol
9/7/19, 9:00 PM - Parker: i think i gained more weight in the last week with my fam then i did the first four weeks in oviedo lol
9/7/19, 9:02 PM - Alex Starr: Ah I usually somehow lose weight on trips cuz of all the walking.
9/7/19, 9:02 PM - Alex Starr: Plus restaurant portions tend to be smallish and there really aren’t snacking opportunities
9/7/19, 9:04 PM - Darren: Don't you walk ~7-10 miles a day normally?
9/7/19, 9:04 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah but I eat a lot
9/7/19, 9:05 PM - Alex Starr: And I walk 15 on vacation cuz there is so much to see
9/7/19, 9:05 PM - Parker: yeah not in spain haha
9/7/19, 9:05 PM - Parker: their diet doesn’t favor losing weight
9/7/19, 9:05 PM - Alex Starr: They were pretty small
9/7/19, 9:05 PM - Alex Starr: No it does not haha
9/7/19, 9:06 PM - Parker: yeah during my program i walked a shit ton but the last week we just ate so much
9/7/19, 9:06 PM - Parker: i also went for a couple runs and stuff
9/7/19, 9:06 PM - Alex Starr: Well if there’s a time for it...
9/7/19, 9:06 PM - Parker: yeah no it’s not a bad thing
9/7/19, 9:06 PM - Parker: we ate well that’s for sure
9/7/19, 9:07 PM - Parker: i just feel so out of shape now haha
9/7/19, 9:07 PM - Parker: literally so much bread meat and cheese
9/7/19, 9:07 PM - Alex Starr: Usually 10+, I work during it.  Doing homework or reading assignments for the bulk of it or answering emails etc.
9/7/19, 9:07 PM - Alex Starr: They weren’t big on fresh veggies.
9/7/19, 9:07 PM - Parker: not at all haha
9/7/19, 9:08 PM - Parker: the bread is insane though
9/7/19, 9:08 PM - Parker: idk if you experienced that or not
9/7/19, 9:08 PM - Alex Starr: It was solid.
9/7/19, 9:08 PM - Alex Starr: Nothing fancy but damn good
9/7/19, 9:08 PM - Alex Starr: Europe in generally knows its bread
9/7/19, 9:08 PM - Parker: insane quantity wise i mean
9/7/19, 9:08 PM - Alex Starr: Oh that too
9/7/19, 9:09 PM - Alex Starr: I usually avoided ordering things that were bread heavy.  Cuz Barcelona has really good patisserie
9/7/19, 9:10 PM - Alex Starr: I definitely wish I’d studied abroad.  Couldn’t find the time.
9/7/19, 9:10 PM - Alex Starr: I’m looking into options abroad for when I only get into UC Merced tho
9/7/19, 9:11 PM - Parker: I mean i didn’t either but most restaurants in oviedo they’d bring a huge thing to the table and then most traditional plates had some form of carb in it
9/7/19, 9:11 PM - Parker: if you still can at some point i strongly recommend it
9/7/19, 9:11 PM - Alex Starr: True but you don’t have to eat the free bread
9/7/19, 9:12 PM - Parker: Actually
most restaurants you asked for it
9/7/19, 9:12 PM - Alex Starr: It’s definitely too late haha.  I’m hopefully going to spend all of March doing interviews
9/7/19, 9:12 PM - Alex Starr: Wait that’s true
9/7/19, 9:12 PM - Parker: the sangria was unmatched though
9/7/19, 9:13 PM - Alex Starr: I wasn’t a huge fan
9/7/19, 9:13 PM - Alex Starr: I just don’t like alcohol unless I’m doing it to get drunk
9/7/19, 9:13 PM - Alex Starr: And then it’s sort of the only way from point A to point B
9/7/19, 9:17 PM - Parker: ah gotcha
9/7/19, 9:18 PM - Parker: if you did enjoy casual drinks, their sangria is really really good
9/7/19, 9:18 PM - Alex Starr: It was definitely not bad
9/7/19, 9:18 PM - Alex Starr: Way better than beer or something
9/7/19, 9:18 PM - Parker: atleast in comparison to sangria you get here
9/7/19, 9:18 PM - Parker: yeah true
9/7/19, 9:19 PM - Alex Starr: Beer id almost take piss over because at least I could drink piss fast
9/7/19, 9:25 PM - Parker: Lol
9/7/19, 11:46 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
9/7/19, 11:46 PM - Matt Casali: Banana slug
9/7/19, 11:59 PM - Collin Hurst: I can really tell by that picture
9/7/19, 11:59 PM - Collin Hurst: Also, wrong chat
9/8/19, 11:08 AM - Parker: damn she has a cute face
9/8/19, 11:12 AM - Jason Greenberg: You should have gotten a better pic so we could update the chat
9/8/19, 11:16 AM - Matt Casali: Oh well

9/8/19, 3:36 PM - Ricky: Shit
9/8/19, 6:18 PM - Jason Greenberg: They main beard guy from The boys kinda seems like Darren’s final form
9/8/19, 6:18 PM - Jason Greenberg: Just putting it out there
9/8/19, 6:18 PM - Darren: Explain
9/8/19, 6:18 PM - Darren: And @16507145032 can you confirm?
9/8/19, 6:21 PM - Alex Starr: Do you mean karl urban?
9/8/19, 6:21 PM - Alex Starr: Eomer?
9/8/19, 6:21 PM - Alex Starr: Bones McCoy?
9/8/19, 6:22 PM - Alex Starr: “Well well well if it ain’t the invisible cunt” guy?
9/8/19, 6:22 PM - Alex Starr: If yes, no I can’t confirm
9/8/19, 6:26 PM - Alex Starr: For those who don’t watch the show, think aggressive as fuck, nihilistic with a strong New Zealand accent and fondness for the word cunt
9/8/19, 6:26 PM - Alex Starr: Who looks like wolverine with a beard
9/8/19, 6:42 PM - Parker: sounds about right
9/8/19, 6:43 PM - Matt Casali: That's darren
9/8/19, 6:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yes
9/8/19, 6:44 PM - Darren: Ryan Reynolds would have an aneurysm if he saw this comparison
9/8/19, 6:46 PM - Parker: Lol
9/8/19, 6:46 PM - Parker: take the compliment
9/8/19, 6:48 PM - Darren: An honest to God brain aneurysm, parker
9/8/19, 6:49 PM - Darren: But I will take it. Thanks Matt!
9/8/19, 6:58 PM - Alex Starr: That exclamation point alone disproves it
9/8/19, 6:59 PM - Alex Starr: Unless it is deeply sarcastic
9/9/19, 11:59 AM - Jason Greenberg: <Media omitted>
9/9/19, 11:59 AM - Collin Hurst: Eyyyy haha

9/9/19, 12:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha
9/9/19, 12:01 PM - Matt Casali: But doris is awesome, you should definitely go and tell her you know Matthew and lucas
9/9/19, 12:02 PM - Darren: Tell her you know Lucas; idk if you want to be associated with a shady fellow like matthew
9/9/19, 12:06 PM - Vaughn: Imma go and ask her for your haircut
9/9/19, 12:06 PM - Matt Casali: That's true
9/9/19, 12:07 PM - Alex Starr: “I’ll have the Casali”

9/10/19, 8:27 PM - Darren: To quote a great man, aaaaand the last horse arrives at the stable
9/10/19, 8:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
9/10/19, 8:27 PM - Darren: Wild accusations coming from Jason milf Hunter Greenberg
9/10/19, 8:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hey I didn’t go and marry to anybody
9/10/19, 8:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: Don’t say you wouldn’t do it if you had the chance
9/10/19, 8:48 PM - Vaughn: <Media omitted>
9/10/19, 8:48 PM - Vaughn: Enhance
9/10/19, 8:57 PM - Alex Starr: Often you buy a ring then go back to get the same ring properly sized cuz the groom to be can’t guess her finger size
9/10/19, 9:11 PM - Parker: ^
9/10/19, 9:11 PM - Parker: Lol
9/10/19, 9:18 PM - Matt Casali: Just saw a movie called honeyland
9/10/19, 9:19 PM - Matt Casali: I'll link trailer in h/videos
9/10/19, 9:19 PM - Matt Casali: One of THE BEST movies of all time
9/10/19, 9:19 PM - Matt Casali: Documentary but doesn't feel like it
9/10/19, 9:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: What was so good about it
9/10/19, 9:23 PM - Matt Casali: Hit ya with the big sad
9/10/19, 9:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: Fuck that
9/10/19, 9:24 PM - Matt Casali: And did a really good job of flushing out the complexities of every single character
9/10/19, 9:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: Big time
9/10/19, 9:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: At least my personal preference is to say fuck that to primarily sad movies
9/10/19, 9:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: You do you matty
9/10/19, 9:25 PM - Alex Starr: Fleshing? Or flushing?
9/10/19, 9:26 PM - Darren: Their character went to live on a farm upstate
9/10/19, 9:29 PM - Alex Starr: Bought the farm?
9/10/19, 9:30 PM - Alex Starr: Im usually more down for sad books
9/10/19, 9:33 PM - Alex Starr: But if it’s sad, it had better be entertaining or make some sort of interesting point
9/10/19, 9:35 PM - Jason Greenberg: What’s a sad book you’ve read and enjoyed?
9/10/19, 9:38 PM - Alex Starr: Malazan is pretty sad.  And the first law trilogy is really really bleak.
9/10/19, 9:39 PM - Alex Starr: I’d be curious as to the spoiler full summary @16507995462
9/10/19, 9:41 PM - Matt Casali: This woman is a beekeeper in extremely rural Macedonia and neighbors come and there's a lot of conflict and interesting bonds between them and fighting for survival on barely anything
9/10/19, 9:42 PM - Matt Casali: I mean the music and cinematography also contribute a ton to how much I liked it
9/10/19, 9:45 PM - Alex Starr: Ah okay
9/10/19, 10:23 PM - Tim Ko: What the hell :(((
9/11/19, 1:02 PM - Alex Starr: Because of today, I have to show up to airports 45 minutes earlier
9/11/19, 1:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: What happened
9/11/19, 1:09 PM - Darren: That was a mildly misleading way to phrase that
9/11/19, 1:37 PM - Parker: ^
9/11/19, 1:41 PM - Alex Starr: 9/11 happened
9/11/19, 1:44 PM - Parker: more than mildly
9/11/19, 1:52 PM - Vaughn: Haha yeah I thought you did something today today
9/11/19, 1:52 PM - Vaughn: Like got a pacemaker or got really really tan
9/11/19, 2:02 PM - Parker: Lol
9/11/19, 2:03 PM - Matt Casali: Lol
9/11/19, 2:03 PM - Alex Starr: Haha
9/11/19, 2:12 PM - Tim Ko: Oh shoot where are u going Alex
9/11/19, 2:17 PM - Alex Starr: Well I’d say that officially puts it above mildly misleading haha
9/11/19, 2:17 PM - Alex Starr: Which is the sweet spot tend
9/11/19, 2:18 PM - Alex Starr: To be fair*
9/11/19, 2:19 PM - Parker: exactly lol
9/11/19, 5:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: tv recommendations?
9/11/19, 5:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: I finished the boys and its tough to top
9/11/19, 5:43 PM - Alex Starr: That ending tho
9/11/19, 5:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: fucking dope
9/11/19, 5:46 PM - Darren: I just finished season 1 of Peaky Blinders. It's a Netflix show about the mob in Birmingham in between WW1 and WW2. Has a good amount of intrigue split between different mob families, the Irish Republic Army, communist uprisers, and the British police force trying to find a fuckton of stolen machine guns in the city
9/11/19, 5:47 PM - Alex Starr: Stranger things too
9/11/19, 5:48 PM - Darren: ^ Season 3 was pretty good
9/11/19, 5:49 PM - Vaughn: Extras on netflix is pretty good
9/11/19, 5:50 PM - Vaughn: Office like show with rick gervaiueis
9/11/19, 5:50 PM - Vaughn: *ricky
9/11/19, 5:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: Might try peaky blinders. Stranger things I liked but was too creepy for me to watch alone
9/11/19, 5:55 PM - Darren: The netflix run of A Series of Unfortunate Events was good too, if you're looking for something a little lighter in tone than cillian Murphy (the scarecrow) murdering people
9/11/19, 5:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: I might check that out too
9/11/19, 5:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: Thanks
9/11/19, 6:45 PM - Parker: I watched mindhunter on netflix when i was in spain and it was really good
9/11/19, 6:45 PM - Parker: about fbi agents in the psychological department that study serial killers so might interest you jason (the psych part)
9/11/19, 6:45 PM - Parker: i only got through season 1 which was really good but i heard it fell off season 2
9/11/19, 6:45 PM - Alex Starr: Dexter is really good
9/11/19, 6:46 PM - Alex Starr: Sticking with the serial killer theme
9/11/19, 6:46 PM - Alex Starr: Also the expanse is really really good
9/11/19, 6:47 PM - Alex Starr: I hear it get compared to the boys a lot in that it adapted the source material extremely well
9/11/19, 6:48 PM - Darren: Is there anything particular about the expanse that makes it great, or is it just a really solid scifi show?
9/11/19, 6:49 PM - Alex Starr: Has a very nice this is how things could be in the future and is very scientifically accurate outside of a couple elements
9/11/19, 6:49 PM - Alex Starr: Plus is pretty character driven which is rare for sci fi
9/11/19, 6:51 PM - Alex Starr: But is much more engaging than other more realistic sci fi like red mars imo
9/11/19, 6:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: I watched a few episodes and liked it
9/11/19, 6:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: Liked dexter for like a season then I got tired of it
9/11/19, 6:55 PM - Alex Starr: Do expanse then
9/11/19, 6:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: Netflix?
9/11/19, 6:55 PM - Alex Starr: Tho you didn’t like dune so all bets are off
9/11/19, 6:55 PM - Alex Starr: Amazon prime
9/11/19, 6:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ok I’ll check it out
9/11/19, 8:12 PM - Ricky: I recommend watching the A’s historic 2019 World Series run
9/11/19, 8:21 PM - Alex Starr: But only if you need a sleeping aid

9/14/19, 9:25 AM - Alex Starr: I never thought I’d say this but I’m so happy to feel sharp pains in my back.
9/14/19, 9:26 AM - Alex Starr: My legs have been tingling a lot over the last couple days and that indicates my back problems are the likely cause instead of the much nastier alternative
9/14/19, 9:46 AM - Parker: Paralysis?
9/14/19, 9:51 AM - Tim Ko: Damn dude
9/14/19, 9:52 AM - Tim Ko: U should go back to the doctor

9/14/19, 10:30 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah only one has primary progressive though, which is the nasty will kill you untreatable can’t walk one
9/14/19, 10:31 AM - Alex Starr: And far and away my biggest fear is some sort of neurodegenerative disorder
9/14/19, 1:33 PM - Parker: Some 16 year old debuted for FC barcelona today and scored in the 2nd minute of the game lol
9/14/19, 1:33 PM - Parker: youngest ever to debut in la liga i think

9/20/19, 8:19 PM - Alex Starr: My brother ordered spicy, and was actually daubing the sweat from his head

9/22/19, 9:25 AM - Parker: i mean kind of
9/22/19, 9:25 AM - Parker: darren’s always had an unspoken beef with me
9/22/19, 9:38 AM - Alex Starr: I dunno about unspoken
9/22/19, 9:44 AM - Parker: true
9/22/19, 9:44 AM - Parker: more so the reason of it is unspoken
9/22/19, 9:44 AM - Parker: the beef itself is not
9/22/19, 11:07 AM - Darren: It's more like unfounded beef
9/22/19, 11:37 AM - Alex Starr: It needs no foundation
9/23/19, 10:46 AM - Parker: see you boys around christmas❤❤
9/23/19, 10:46 AM - Parker: unless you decide to SEND IT to eugene for a football game

9/23/19, 12:43 PM - Alex Starr: Weird time for an east coast trip

9/23/19, 12:51 PM - Parker: Looking at you tim, october 5th babbyyyy

9/24/19, 7:09 PM - Parker: so sick
9/24/19, 7:33 PM - Alex Starr: Do you mean disco or am I missing something? Or both?
9/24/19, 7:33 PM - Parker: dispensary
9/24/19, 7:34 PM - Alex Starr: So neither
9/24/19, 8:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ohhh
9/24/19, 8:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: Dope good send
9/25/19, 10:21 PM - Tim Ko: <Media omitted>
9/25/19, 10:21 PM - Parker: Hahahaha
9/26/19, 7:36 AM - Ricky: Hahahahaha
9/26/19, 8:29 PM - Parker: i found my pen collin😂😂😂
9/26/19, 8:29 PM - Parker: i’m an idiot
9/26/19, 8:39 PM - Collin Hurst: Lol where
9/26/19, 8:47 PM - Jason Greenberg: But where
9/26/19, 10:29 PM - Parker: buried in my backpack lol
9/26/19, 10:30 PM - Parker: i could’ve sworn i put it there that night but i just didn’t see it i guess haha
9/27/19, 1:19 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
9/27/19, 1:20 PM - Collin Hurst: true
9/27/19, 1:21 PM - Collin Hurst: I feel like baseball would be better if there were less innings but it was easier to hit the ball
9/27/19, 1:22 PM - Darren: Idea: 6 innings of regulation play. If it's still tied after that, they switch to metal bats
9/27/19, 1:23 PM - Ricky: lol
9/27/19, 1:23 PM - Collin Hurst: and the pitchers have to throw opposite
9/27/19, 1:23 PM - Ricky: I think it’s just one of those, ya gotta know how difficult the game is to appreciate it
9/27/19, 1:23 PM - Ricky: It’s not like people are scoring all the time in soccer or something
9/27/19, 1:24 PM - Darren: But most other sports are on strict time schedules
9/27/19, 1:24 PM - Collin Hurst: its not just scoring, its the rate of exciting stuff happening
9/27/19, 1:24 PM - Ricky: Trueeee, but baseball has started implementing timers and things
9/27/19, 1:25 PM - Darren: A soccer game cannot go longer than 90 minutes + 30 minute overtime + PKs + at most 10 minutes of added time
9/27/19, 1:25 PM - Ricky: That’s what I mean, to me like every pitch is exciting, a nasty curve is just as impressive as a solid base hit
9/27/19, 1:25 PM - Ricky: But if u went to a shutout game you’d be like, that was boring af
9/27/19, 1:26 PM - Darren: There's just so much waiting between every pitch
9/27/19, 1:26 PM - Ricky: Yeah that’s true
9/27/19, 1:26 PM - Darren: There's less than 30 minutes of pure action that can be spread out over 3 hours
9/27/19, 1:27 PM - Darren: Timers is the right move imo. There is some meta game lost when you rush the players, but as an outfielder and a potential viewer, I would appreciate it if there wasn't so much faffing about
9/27/19, 1:28 PM - Collin Hurst: there should be a 5 second timer in between pitches
9/27/19, 1:28 PM - Collin Hurst: that would speed things up enough
9/27/19, 1:29 PM - Collin Hurst: so if you have a 3 second windup, you have a good 2 seconds from catchers mitt to starting your next pitch
9/27/19, 1:29 PM - Darren: That's so quick
9/27/19, 1:29 PM - Collin Hurst: it would be exciting
9/27/19, 1:30 PM - Ricky: Hahaha
9/27/19, 1:30 PM - Ricky: That would be exciting
9/27/19, 1:30 PM - Ricky: But would have to be a diff sport
9/27/19, 1:31 PM - Ricky: I think just the fundamental rules of the game can’t Avoid some good faffing about
9/27/19, 1:31 PM - Collin Hurst: theres nothing like ringing it around the horn after a good strikeout
9/27/19, 1:32 PM - Parker: ^
9/27/19, 1:32 PM - Parker: 😂
9/27/19, 1:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: They could split the 9 innings into 18 but keep the time limit the same so it feels like more is happening
9/27/19, 1:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: Wait ok I get there’s no time limit so each inning gets 1.5 outs
9/27/19, 1:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: Don’t get up you might miss a whole inning
9/27/19, 1:53 PM - Ricky: That would like double the length of the game haha
9/27/19, 1:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ok back to 9 innings but only 1 out per inning
9/27/19, 1:56 PM - Vaughn: They gotta give you a letter every time you hit a certain zone in the outfield. Spell out the word Homerun and boom
9/27/19, 1:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha
9/27/19, 1:59 PM - Collin Hurst: they should make a game like that
9/27/19, 1:59 PM - Collin Hurst: a video game
9/27/19, 2:00 PM - Parker: **baseball purists punching the air rn**
9/27/19, 2:00 PM - Darren: The MLB should honestly just stop wasting everyone's time and switch to kickball
9/27/19, 2:07 PM - Alex Starr: Ricky you should’ve hit the soccer thing harder
9/27/19, 2:08 PM - Collin Hurst: says the guy that likes football
9/27/19, 2:08 PM - Alex Starr: Football has the same gap between plays, but is way more complex
9/27/19, 2:08 PM - Alex Starr: So you can actually analyze what happened instead and situations tend to be unique
9/27/19, 2:08 PM - Collin Hurst: true
9/27/19, 2:09 PM - Alex Starr: Not to mention the raw athleticism in football is impressive on its own
9/27/19, 2:10 PM - Darren: This applies to almost every sport at a professional level
9/27/19, 2:11 PM - Alex Starr: The notable exception being baseball?
9/27/19, 2:11 PM - Alex Starr: And marathon running/soccer to a lesser extent aren’t really viscerally impressive most of the time
9/27/19, 2:15 PM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
9/27/19, 2:16 PM - Alex Starr: Not viscerally impressive
9/27/19, 2:17 PM - Ricky: Ah, but he can’t push really hard against a 300lb guy in place for 4 seconds
9/27/19, 2:17 PM - Alex Starr: It’s impressive how a chess match is, not how a sprint is
9/27/19, 2:18 PM - Parker: if you’re talking about pure athleticism, yes they are
9/27/19, 2:18 PM - Alex Starr: That gets into what is pure athleticism and I’m not trying to define that
9/27/19, 2:18 PM - Alex Starr: Again I agree they are equally impressive, but not in that shock and awe way
9/27/19, 2:19 PM - Alex Starr: A nuke is impressive in a more shocking way even if climate change will kill way more
9/27/19, 2:20 PM - Ricky: Boooo
9/27/19, 2:20 PM - Alex Starr: And it’s not the rule, a bicycle kick is ridiculous
9/27/19, 2:20 PM - Ricky: Running 100 miles way more impressive than anything a football player does
9/27/19, 2:20 PM - Alex Starr: They are different
9/27/19, 2:20 PM - Ricky: For a sub 7 pace
9/27/19, 2:20 PM - Alex Starr: Put him in a football game he’d die
9/27/19, 2:21 PM - Ricky: Make a lineman run 100 miles, they’d die
9/27/19, 2:21 PM - Alex Starr: Put a football player in an ultra marathon, probably wouldn’t finish
9/27/19, 2:21 PM - Darren: Alex is just an edgy millennial who only likes violence
9/27/19, 2:21 PM - Alex Starr: Nah they can take their time and finish
9/27/19, 2:21 PM - Alex Starr: Which is my point
9/27/19, 2:21 PM - Ricky: No
9/27/19, 2:21 PM - Alex Starr: By definition they can haha
9/27/19, 2:21 PM - Ricky: Cuz if the marathon runner could play football agains 4 year olds then he’d be fine
9/27/19, 2:22 PM - Ricky: I’m saying the professional level of marathon running
9/27/19, 2:23 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t think this says anything about the point im making
9/27/19, 2:24 PM - Alex Starr: Basically, you watch a marathon for 5 seconds you say he’s running.
9/27/19, 2:24 PM - Alex Starr: You watch a running back for 5 seconds and there’s a whole lot more athletic stuff happening
9/27/19, 2:26 PM - Collin Hurst: Maybe if you watched 100 miles of running back plays you'd say the same
9/27/19, 2:36 PM - Parker: but find someone who is really into running and doesn’t care or know much about football and they’d say the opposite
9/27/19, 3:15 PM - Alex Starr: Haha
9/27/19, 10:24 PM - Ricky: We god damn made it!
9/27/19, 10:24 PM - Collin Hurst: sup
9/27/19, 10:29 PM - Matt Casali: I'm confused haha
9/27/19, 10:50 PM - Darren: If I had to guess... A's?
9/27/19, 11:38 PM - Collin Hurst: they clinched wild card
9/27/19, 11:42 PM - Ricky: Yessir
9/27/19, 11:43 PM - Ricky: Lost the game though...
9/27/19, 11:43 PM - Ricky: But so did the Indiana
9/27/19, 11:43 PM - Ricky: Indians*
9/27/19, 11:43 PM - Ricky: Their dugout was so sad at the end of the game 😢
9/27/19, 11:43 PM - Ricky: even though the A’s lost, the Indians lost out of the wildcard spot
9/27/19, 11:45 PM - Ricky: Also, personal update: I’m in western Hollywood with grace at a crazy ass club where a bunch of primarily nude crazy ripped guys are dancing lmao
9/27/19, 11:45 PM - Collin Hurst: noice

10/25/19, 11:54 AM - Alex Starr: The sound quality was so low on my phone I had to look at the comments.  Jack resnick is saluting somewhere
10/25/19, 11:57 AM - Darren: In more ways than one
10/25/19, 11:58 AM - Alex Starr: Of course.  Or maybe a flag is at half mast in solidarity.
10/25/19, 11:59 AM - Parker: Lol
10/25/19, 1:14 PM - Parker: CS people i have a python question
10/25/19, 1:14 PM - Collin Hurst: sup
10/25/19, 1:14 PM - Matt Casali: You have come to the right place
10/25/19, 1:17 PM - Parker: So i have a data set and i’m supposed to make the second to last column the target variable  to predict if the any one person has diabetes based on whether it has a 1 or a 0
10/25/19, 1:17 PM - Parker: But i keep getting an error when i try to subset it
10/25/19, 1:18 PM - Parker: So how would i grab the the second to last column if that makes sense
10/25/19, 1:18 PM - Matt Casali: Okay I am not the right place Haha
10/25/19, 1:20 PM - Parker: <Media omitted>
10/25/19, 1:20 PM - Parker: Lol it’s okay
10/25/19, 1:22 PM - Collin Hurst: can you send the whole error or the raw code? theres a lot of jargon there lol
10/25/19, 1:23 PM - Parker: Yeah sorry that was a screenshot bc i was doing it on a school computer
10/25/19, 1:23 PM - Parker: one sec
10/25/19, 1:23 PM - Collin Hurst: is the data a list of objects?
10/25/19, 1:24 PM - Collin Hurst: if so the second to last column for each entry would be obj[-2]
10/25/19, 1:27 PM - Parker: <Media omitted>
10/25/19, 1:27 PM - Parker: <Media omitted>
10/25/19, 1:27 PM - Parker: the data is like a data frame with a bunch of variables
10/25/19, 1:28 PM - Parker: that’s what i did but my prof said i have to “fix my subset for the features set”
10/25/19, 1:28 PM - Collin Hurst: it looks like it is getting the second to last when it sets X_diabetes
10/25/19, 1:28 PM - Parker: how come X_diabetes isn’t defined though
10/25/19, 1:29 PM - Parker: didn’t i define it at the top
10/25/19, 1:37 PM - Parker: <Media omitted>
10/25/19, 1:37 PM - Parker: that’s the whole error
10/25/19, 1:51 PM - Tim Ko: Ask me anything
10/25/19, 1:52 PM - Tim Ko: I think u have a bug in the code
10/25/19, 1:53 PM - Parker: Stfu
10/25/19, 2:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha
10/25/19, 2:21 PM - Parker: Darren any idea?
10/25/19, 2:21 PM - Parker: i’m at a loss
10/25/19, 2:59 PM - Collin Hurst: Try doing what it recommends
10/25/19, 3:05 PM - Tim Ko: Parker go to github, find the right code, and copy paste
10/25/19, 3:05 PM - Tim Ko: Just like how we did it back in the days in Nguyen’s class
10/25/19, 3:05 PM - Tim Ko: 😂
10/25/19, 3:05 PM - Collin Hurst: It seems like your fit function is expecting something else than your giving it
10/25/19, 3:06 PM - Parker: i have no idea what it’s telling me is the problem hahaha
10/25/19, 3:06 PM - Parker: this is foreign to me
10/25/19, 3:06 PM - Parker: yeah
10/25/19, 3:06 PM - Parker: i just can’t figure out what
10/25/19, 3:07 PM - Collin Hurst: It's telling you to reshape your array
10/25/19, 3:08 PM - Collin Hurst: Like just call X_diabetes.reshape(-1,1)
10/25/19, 3:14 PM - Collin Hurst: Before you fit
10/25/19, 4:09 PM - Parker: Ok
10/25/19, 4:09 PM - Parker: Do i have to import something for that or is it part of pandas
10/25/19, 4:14 PM - Collin Hurst: Idk but if you run it it will tell you if you need to import anything
10/25/19, 4:35 PM - Parker: Oh true ok
10/25/19, 4:38 PM - Alex Starr: Import numpy
10/25/19, 4:38 PM - Parker: Lit thank you
10/25/19, 4:51 PM - Alex Starr: Numpy is amazing
10/25/19, 4:51 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t even use pandas
10/25/19, 4:51 PM - Parker: I figured it out hahaha
10/25/19, 4:51 PM - Parker: i’m an idiot
10/25/19, 4:52 PM - Parker: i was using the wrong data set😂
10/25/19, 4:52 PM - Darren: Boi
10/25/19, 4:52 PM - Alex Starr: That would do it
10/25/19, 4:53 PM - Parker: To be fair the first question used a file called diabetes_w_missing so i figured it was the same for this question
10/25/19, 4:53 PM - Parker: but this one was the file diabetes
10/25/19, 4:53 PM - Alex Starr: Also Tim we won’t have power
10/25/19, 4:56 PM - Ricky: Thanks for keeping us in the loop
10/25/19, 4:57 PM - Parker: Lol

10/25/19, 6:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Gif?
10/25/19, 6:28 PM - Alex Starr: It’s the entire outside of the stadium all eight floors
10/25/19, 6:29 PM - Alex Starr: Also if I wanted a job this place would be huge for networking
10/25/19, 6:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: What you’re looking for is a drone pan-out
10/25/19, 6:29 PM - Alex Starr: Exactly
10/25/19, 6:29 PM - Alex Starr: Or a floor by floor video
10/25/19, 6:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: Do you guys have ideas about what you wanna make
10/25/19, 6:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: Or do you have to promise not to think of anything until the contest starts?
10/25/19, 6:40 PM - Alex Starr: It’s looking like people aren’t too committed to going all out so idk
10/25/19, 7:40 PM - Tim Ko: Collin did he was only there for the food

10/28/19, 12:27 AM - Tim Ko: Ayyy Klay is a close 3rd
10/28/19, 12:27 AM - Tim Ko: If warriors traded steph for harden i would not be happy
10/28/19, 12:27 AM - Parker: i’m gonna pretend you didn’t say that
10/28/19, 12:28 AM - Tim Ko: Ok harden is a much better player than klay

10/28/19, 12:29 AM - Parker: he’s a national treasure

10/29/19, 1:18 PM - Matt Casali: Jesus calm down haha
10/29/19, 1:20 PM - Darren: This is a man that saw my bike helmet and asked if I rode a bicycle or a motorcycle, as if it's reasonable to wear a bike helmet when you're going 70mph

10/31/19, 10:11 AM - Ricky: We should run a forward stepwise algorithm to see which variables most greatly influence age, do a little LOOCV to get as certain of a prediction of how old our kids will be when their born

10/31/19, 10:22 AM - Jason Greenberg: Ahahaha

10/31/19, 10:43 AM - Darren: We could use household income as an instrumental variable to deal with the confounding variable of race because income is correlated to both age and race
10/31/19, 2:19 PM - Ricky: That’s honestly part of what I did in my midterm today
10/31/19, 2:21 PM - Alex Starr: It actually does correlate with race.  In Korea you are born 1 year old
10/31/19, 2:21 PM - Alex Starr: So they clearly sampled in a biased manner for the study.
10/31/19, 4:38 PM - Matt Casali: ^
10/31/19, 5:52 PM - Darren: <Media omitted>

10/31/19, 6:02 PM - Darren: But appreciated
10/31/19, 6:04 PM - Alex Starr: I was gonna make it a what are the odds but that would be tricky when you said 1-1
10/31/19, 9:30 PM - Ricky: Hahah Alex just post it on the next post anyone makes about a student body on campus
10/31/19, 9:32 PM - Alex Starr: Lol
10/31/19, 9:33 PM - Alex Starr: “Local club helps high schoolers with Down syndrome”
10/31/19, 9:35 PM - Ricky: Hahaha this sounds like a pretty fun potential game
10/31/19, 9:43 PM - Alex Starr: Just casually accusing people of rape?
10/31/19, 10:03 PM - Ricky: Hahaha no, Like a what’s the worst scenario you could apply that phrase to
10/31/19, 10:05 PM - Alex Starr: “Victims of rape anonymous meeting Sunday at 5:00”
10/31/19, 10:33 PM - Ricky: Damn, that. Is a good one

11/1/19, 12:44 PM - Collin Hurst: I would hope not
11/1/19, 12:45 PM - Alex Starr: Good answer

11/1/19, 3:22 PM - Collin Hurst: we can go winter break too

11/1/19, 3:34 PM - Ricky: Oooh I’m down!

11/1/19, 3:35 PM - Collin Hurst: Yee
11/1/19, 3:36 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah that'd be fun
11/1/19, 3:40 PM - Tim Ko: Down
11/1/19, 3:48 PM - Alex Starr: That’s a damn good idea
11/1/19, 4:40 PM - Tim Ko: <Media omitted>

11/3/19, 12:54 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah that’s what I thought lol
11/3/19, 12:55 PM - Parker: Hahah no it’s actually her bf
11/3/19, 12:55 PM - Parker: Like long term

11/3/19, 5:18 PM - Ricky: ...
11/3/19, 5:18 PM - Ricky: Cuz she’s very attractive
11/3/19, 5:19 PM - Ricky: And sponsored by everyone

11/3/19, 5:19 PM - Vaughn: I watched some of the stream highlights earlier
11/3/19, 5:20 PM - Ricky: Noice
11/3/19, 5:20 PM - Darren: Huh
11/3/19, 5:20 PM - Ricky: She is the face of league of legends streaming
11/3/19, 5:21 PM - Ricky: And one of the huge faces of twitch in general
11/3/19, 5:21 PM - Darren: Oh ok so she actually streams games
11/3/19, 5:21 PM - Ricky: She is the reason there is a this a thique with three qs
11/3/19, 5:22 PM - Ricky: Yeah, she started with league but now does all main stream games pretty much
11/3/19, 5:22 PM - Ricky: I’ve never watched her stream but seen many highlights on YouTube
11/3/19, 5:26 PM - Parker: Wait which maya
11/3/19, 5:26 PM - Parker: I haven’t either
11/3/19, 5:27 PM - Darren: Maya higa from mvhs
11/3/19, 5:28 PM - Alex Starr: I only know someone named pokimane existed before this because I guess a company that sponsors her also cosponsors a Korean Starcraft 1 tournament.
11/3/19, 5:29 PM - Parker: Ohhh that’s sick
11/3/19, 5:32 PM - Alex Starr: Where/how?
11/3/19, 8:03 PM - Ricky: She went to Maya’s house for a stream apparently
11/3/19, 8:03 PM - Ricky: Maya’s famous on twitch for being the animal girl
11/3/19, 8:05 PM - Alex Starr: I have no idea what that means
11/3/19, 8:05 PM - Darren: Other than being an e-girl, that's very on brand
11/4/19, 9:36 AM - Matt Casali: I just saw a visiting high school kid throw literally a whole glass of milk at a girl
11/4/19, 9:37 AM - Ricky: Hahahahaha
11/4/19, 9:38 AM - Matt Casali: And the teacher/chaperone was sitting on the other side of the quad and he's just like "not cool sammy"
11/4/19, 10:08 AM - Darren: <Media omitted>
11/4/19, 11:05 AM - Jason Greenberg: Haha

"Its nice to see you grace, but I was about to open up my 7th chakra"
11/6/19, 10:14 AM - Parker: Lol
11/6/19, 10:25 AM - Ricky: Hahahaha true!

11/6/19, 1:09 PM - Parker: that was super interesting
11/6/19, 1:10 PM - Parker: i literally remember watching those videos when i was applying to schools and it definitely made me wanna go to certain places lol
11/6/19, 1:10 PM - Parker: Or gave me a very false perception of what college was
11/6/19, 1:11 PM - Matt Casali: It influenced me too
11/6/19, 1:11 PM - Matt Casali: You should see @imschmackeducsc
11/6/19, 1:12 PM - Matt Casali: The CEO (president or whatever) sounds like a little kid
11/6/19, 1:12 PM - Matt Casali: Like the archetypal frat guy
11/6/19, 1:12 PM - Parker: Oh yeah 100%
11/6/19, 1:12 PM - Parker: do you guys have a ucsc barstool page
11/6/19, 1:13 PM - Matt Casali: Prob not

11/6/19, 1:14 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
11/6/19, 1:23 PM - Vaughn: <Media omitted>

11/6/19, 1:34 PM - Parker: barstoolducks gang
11/6/19, 2:21 PM - Matt Casali: Disgusting
11/6/19, 2:22 PM - Collin Hurst: reminds me of the oobacrew fail compilation
11/6/19, 2:22 PM - Collin Hurst: prepare your anus
11/6/19, 2:22 PM - Darren: That's the whole channel
11/6/19, 2:23 PM - Matt Casali: Oh shit
11/6/19, 2:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: 🔥🔥🔥
11/6/19, 2:24 PM - Parker: Oof
11/6/19, 2:25 PM - Alex Starr: Anyone wanna give me some context
11/6/19, 2:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: circa 2017 Cooba and vooba were uploading content on the regular. We’re talking a weekly to monthly basis here. They would rack up a LOT of hours on rocket league from which they would post in compilations of them dicking around in the game, the equivalent of perfectly combo-ing someone 0-300% with fox, only to miss the upair and fall off the stage, but with rocket league.
11/6/19, 2:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: And now Darren roasted their entire genomes
11/6/19, 2:33 PM - Matt Casali: I started that
11/6/19, 2:33 PM - Matt Casali: *starred
11/6/19, 2:33 PM - Matt Casali: Thank you
11/6/19, 2:35 PM - Alex Starr: I know about that disaster zone, meant about the Twitter  link I can’t really click through
11/6/19, 2:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh lol
11/6/19, 2:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: Company run by college kids without a moral compass scammed young people out of money
11/6/19, 2:37 PM - Alex Starr: Seems par for the course rather than disgusting
11/6/19, 2:38 PM - Alex Starr: So they were like barstool?
11/6/19, 2:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah a regular f jerry
11/6/19, 2:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: Well actually they created their own content so not f jerry
11/6/19, 2:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: They would pay kids to throw a party and film it
11/6/19, 2:43 PM - Alex Starr: Unrelated, WhatsApp wouldn’t update on my phone so I had to delete and reinstall so I lost like the last two days of messages
11/6/19, 2:46 PM - Alex Starr: How do you guys have time to be this knowledgeable of YouTube?
11/6/19, 2:46 PM - Alex Starr: I mean it’s Collin and Vaughn’s livelihood as streamers so that makes sense but other than that
11/6/19, 2:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: I watch that instead of smash tournaments
11/6/19, 2:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: Tomato tomato
11/6/19, 2:55 PM - Alex Starr: I haven’t watched one in at least a month
11/6/19, 2:56 PM - Alex Starr: And only do so while working out or walking to class haha plus it’s usually Starcraft
11/6/19, 2:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: Tomato tomato
11/6/19, 2:56 PM - Alex Starr: That’s my line
11/6/19, 2:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’m appropriating it
11/6/19, 2:57 PM - Alex Starr: You’re raping my culture that’s what
11/6/19, 2:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha I think it was first used in like Babylon so that’s not justified
11/6/19, 3:00 PM - Alex Starr: I’ve always been Babylonian.  I have a cuneiform tablet of my ancestor holding two tomatoes
11/6/19, 3:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha
11/6/19, 4:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: For herdsgiving
11/6/19, 4:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: Who is not free Saturday the 30th?
11/6/19, 4:33 PM - Alex Starr: Um
11/6/19, 4:33 PM - Alex Starr: My apps are due the first so remains to be seen
11/6/19, 4:34 PM - Alex Starr: Are we doing kenzo am I baking?
11/6/19, 4:34 PM - Darren: We can write your apps by committee
11/6/19, 4:35 PM - Alex Starr: Or am I baking*
11/6/19, 4:35 PM - Alex Starr: That ends well
11/6/19, 4:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: I think we should cook
11/6/19, 4:49 PM - Matt Casali: I agree fullheartedly
11/6/19, 4:50 PM - Matt Casali: I'm watching the bon appetit making perfect thanksgiving thing and its hyping me up
11/6/19, 4:50 PM - Matt Casali: Although I couldn't be as bold as them haha
11/6/19, 4:57 PM - Ricky: ^
11/6/19, 5:15 PM - Darren: I think we should do both
11/6/19, 5:16 PM - Darren: And if not unlimited sushi Thanksgiving break, we should do it winter break
11/6/19, 5:17 PM - Ricky: I am all for it 10000%
11/6/19, 5:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: Down
11/6/19, 5:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: So I’m assuming that everyone except for Collin who hasn’t seen the original text is free Saturday the 30th for herdsgiving
11/6/19, 5:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: And maybe Alex but we will pressure him
11/6/19, 5:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: Mark your calendars
11/6/19, 5:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lars get the twine and whatnot
11/6/19, 5:34 PM - Matt Casali: I'll ask my parents
11/6/19, 5:34 PM - Matt Casali: What we're doing so I know if I'm free
11/6/19, 5:49 PM - Darren: You did only ask if people couldn't go
11/6/19, 5:54 PM - Alex Starr: I aiming to have my apps done the 27th, but we will see how that goes.
11/6/19, 7:14 PM - Tim Ko: Gang
11/6/19, 7:14 PM - Tim Ko: I’m so down for all u can eat sushi
11/6/19, 7:15 PM - Tim Ko: This time we try to beat $1350
11/6/19, 7:15 PM - Parker: we should do it over winter break
11/6/19, 7:15 PM - Parker: i’m in seattle
11/6/19, 7:16 PM - Parker: but that was known
11/6/19, 7:23 PM - Alex Starr: Was it tho?
11/6/19, 7:29 PM - Parker: ^
11/6/19, 8:28 PM - Alex Starr: Have we made any progress on herd 2020?
11/6/19, 9:09 PM - Darren: Hawaii 2020
11/6/19, 9:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: I was waiting to finish midterms to make the poll
11/6/19, 9:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: Should be able to get to it this weekend
11/6/19, 9:38 PM - Alex Starr: Wind seems to be blowing that way
11/7/19, 8:43 AM - Alex Starr: I’d take it on but last time my poll was pretty unpopular
11/7/19, 8:44 AM - Alex Starr: I’m on board with Hawaii
11/7/19, 8:44 AM - Jason Greenberg: If I don’t get it done by the end of the weekend I’ll do Tims pushups
11/7/19, 8:45 AM - Alex Starr: We know how empty that promise is @16502796204
11/7/19, 8:45 AM - Alex Starr: Let’s just skip the poll and executive decision Hawaii
11/7/19, 8:48 AM - Jason Greenberg: Ok yeah actually
11/7/19, 8:54 AM - Alex Starr: We have a majority with you me Parker Darren and Collin
11/7/19, 8:55 AM - Alex Starr: And it’s not that the others are nos, they just haven’t said yes yet
11/7/19, 8:55 AM - Alex Starr: We now need to discuss where in Hawaii we want to go
11/7/19, 9:01 AM - Matt Casali: I'm a no
11/7/19, 9:05 AM - Ricky: Lmao
11/7/19, 9:06 AM - Collin Hurst: Hawaii let's do it!
11/7/19, 9:06 AM - Collin Hurst: It's not as expensive as abroad
11/7/19, 10:10 AM - Jason Greenberg: At the time I was joking
11/7/19, 10:10 AM - Jason Greenberg: Not saying I’m not open to it
11/7/19, 10:11 AM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
11/7/19, 10:11 AM - Ricky: Lmao
11/7/19, 10:11 AM - Ricky: Let’s do here trip to Cuesta
11/7/19, 10:11 AM - Ricky: Herd*
11/7/19, 10:59 AM - Parker: how come
11/7/19, 11:02 AM - Matt Casali: Theres many less expensive things we can do
11/7/19, 11:03 AM - Collin Hurst: True but not as cool
11/7/19, 11:03 AM - Collin Hurst: So you're only down for roadtrip in US?
11/7/19, 11:03 AM - Matt Casali: And I kinda hate the relationship between Hawaii and tourism especially right now
11/7/19, 11:03 AM - Matt Casali: I'd rather not interact with that
11/7/19, 11:03 AM - Matt Casali: This is my by far most desired option
11/7/19, 11:04 AM - Parker: Agreed but there’s also many less expensive things we can do at any point
11/7/19, 11:05 AM - Matt Casali: I'm planning on living on my own after school and going on one other trip and theres no way I'm gonna make enough money to go and enjoy myself in hawaii
11/7/19, 11:05 AM - Collin Hurst: I feel like it depends on where we go in hawaii
11/7/19, 11:06 AM - Collin Hurst: I wouldn't want to have the basic tourist experience either
11/7/19, 11:08 AM - Matt Casali: Hawaii is the  basic tourist experience haha
11/7/19, 11:08 AM - Darren: Doing a "more authentic" Hawaii trip will be cheaper than the standard resort style trip, but let's not trick ourselves: it will still be in the price range Matt and others are uncomfortable with
11/7/19, 11:08 AM - Tim Ko: Hawaii is expensive lol
11/7/19, 11:08 AM - Tim Ko: Might as well go to the DR
11/7/19, 11:08 AM - Collin Hurst: True
11/7/19, 11:09 AM - Tim Ko: Get some authentic mofongo while we’re at it
11/7/19, 11:09 AM - Collin Hurst: Ftr tho it is less than anything abroad
11/7/19, 11:09 AM - Matt Casali: You dont have to convince me on that
11/7/19, 11:09 AM - Darren: Less than anything abroad that hasn't been stricken by the group
11/7/19, 11:09 AM - Collin Hurst: Airbnbs are like 20/night per person not too bad
11/7/19, 11:09 AM - Matt Casali: I think it would be super cool to get an Airbnb in seattle or something
11/7/19, 11:10 AM - Collin Hurst: Interesting
11/7/19, 11:11 AM - Collin Hurst: Im still not feeling a road trip very much but I respect the budget too
11/7/19, 11:11 AM - Parker: You don’t have to convince me of seattle lol
11/7/19, 11:11 AM - Parker: also my dad lives there so we wouldn’t need one haha
11/7/19, 11:12 AM - Parker: also let’s not kid ourselves: we’re not gonna get a super authentic hawaiian experience regardless bc were white and don’t know locals
11/7/19, 11:12 AM - Matt Casali: Big up
11/7/19, 11:59 AM - Alex Starr: So what is in price range?
11/7/19, 12:00 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz Vegas is still an option
11/7/19, 12:05 PM - Alex Starr: I’d just really like to avoid a road trip
11/7/19, 12:10 PM - Parker: Vegas is one though that would incur lots of unseen costs as opposed to upfront travel costs
11/7/19, 12:10 PM - Parker: bc drinks/casinos are expensive
11/7/19, 12:12 PM - Alex Starr: Ik
11/7/19, 12:13 PM - Parker: I can make a form rn if you guys want
11/7/19, 12:13 PM - Parker: what all do we want on it
11/7/19, 12:13 PM - Alex Starr: It’s that trips to the scenic middle of nowhere don’t hold a lot of appeal and I’m trying to find a middle ground
11/7/19, 12:14 PM - Darren: Middle ground is a word
11/7/19, 12:14 PM - Alex Starr: Or is it 2?  Not sure where ur going with that
11/7/19, 12:19 PM - Darren: Well it's not going on a road trip
11/7/19, 12:19 PM - Alex Starr: Then I am all aboard the middle ground
11/7/19, 12:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’m about to do it
11/7/19, 12:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: Wanna help me come up with price estimates?
11/7/19, 12:31 PM - Parker: down
11/7/19, 12:32 PM - Parker: i can make a google sheet too sometime soon
11/7/19, 12:33 PM - Alex Starr: Go ahead give all of us editing power as well
11/7/19, 12:36 PM - Alex Starr: Except maybe Tim.  We can only handle so many images of the rugged Siberian tundra.
11/7/19, 12:36 PM - Alex Starr: Ricky would u be down for Hawaii?
11/7/19, 12:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ok I’ll make it
11/7/19, 12:42 PM - Parker: yes
11/7/19, 12:42 PM - Parker: yee*
11/7/19, 12:42 PM - Parker: Lol
11/7/19, 12:42 PM - Alex Starr: Okay I think another thing would if people gave a price range they ware looking for
11/7/19, 12:48 PM - Matt Casali: <500
11/7/19, 12:48 PM - Matt Casali: For whole trip
11/7/19, 12:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: Jesus
11/7/19, 12:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: Up to 1.5k
11/7/19, 12:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: Shared the doc
11/7/19, 12:50 PM - Parker: Probably like 1000 for me
11/7/19, 12:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: Everyone can edit except Tim but he can make comments
11/7/19, 12:50 PM - Alex Starr: Hahaha
11/7/19, 12:51 PM - Alex Starr: Wait not even a road trip works on <500
11/7/19, 12:51 PM - Alex Starr: Or if it does it does so barely.
11/7/19, 12:51 PM - Alex Starr: I mean I guess it does
11/7/19, 12:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: I don’t think we can take a flight anywhere sub 500
11/7/19, 12:54 PM - Parker: ^
11/7/19, 12:54 PM - Alex Starr: No a flight to Hawaii is 500ish
11/7/19, 12:54 PM - Parker: unless it’s domestic and not hawaii or alaska
11/7/19, 12:54 PM - Alex Starr: And water is free
11/7/19, 12:54 PM - Parker: a flight to eugene is $69
11/7/19, 12:55 PM - Darren: Nice
11/7/19, 12:55 PM - Alex Starr: I think we barely do Hawaii under 1000
11/7/19, 12:58 PM - Alex Starr: And anywhere non-domestic is out hard
11/7/19, 1:00 PM - Parker: Road trip is looking better and better
11/7/19, 1:00 PM - Alex Starr: Nope
11/7/19, 1:00 PM - Alex Starr: Still ugly as fuck
11/7/19, 1:00 PM - Alex Starr: No matter how drunk I might get
11/7/19, 1:01 PM - Ricky: I don’t get why your so opposed but to each their own
11/7/19, 1:02 PM - Parker: ^
11/7/19, 1:03 PM - Parker: A girl in akpsi that graduated last year did a post grad road trip with two of her friends from eugene all the way to nashville and went to like yellowstone and zion and a bunch of other places and it looked like a ton of fun
11/7/19, 1:03 PM - Alex Starr: Lack of good food/apathy toward nature/it’ll be hot as all fuck/back pain
11/7/19, 1:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’d be down if we rent a van to fit everyone
11/7/19, 1:03 PM - Parker: The first and last excused are valid
11/7/19, 1:03 PM - Parker: excuses*
11/7/19, 1:03 PM - Parker: ^
11/7/19, 1:04 PM - Alex Starr: The other two are opinions tho
11/7/19, 1:04 PM - Parker: Yeah, and they’re not valid
11/7/19, 1:04 PM - Alex Starr: The fuck
11/7/19, 1:04 PM - Darren: Ding dong your opinion is wrong
11/7/19, 1:05 PM - Parker: 🛎
11/7/19, 1:05 PM - Alex Starr: I’m not saying that opinions about price are wrong
11/7/19, 1:05 PM - Alex Starr: Let’s be civil
11/7/19, 1:10 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah Hawaii would be about 900 dollars.  With snacks restaurants etc. and 7 days there
11/7/19, 1:15 PM - Alex Starr: Any news on what a road trip would cost?
11/7/19, 1:20 PM - Parker: Haha i’m just kidding
11/7/19, 1:20 PM - Parker: but the heat being a factor is soft on your part
11/7/19, 1:21 PM - Parker: I’ll look into it rn
11/7/19, 1:23 PM - Alex Starr: Have you hiked in Utah in the summer? My family did.  One of us nearly didn’t make it back.
11/7/19, 1:23 PM - Alex Starr: That last bit might be completely unrelated to the heat, but it certainly made things more ominous.
11/7/19, 1:41 PM - Parker: Hahaha jason
11/7/19, 1:41 PM - Parker: Slapshot
11/7/19, 1:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hey it’s cheap haha
11/7/19, 1:42 PM - Parker: and quick
11/7/19, 1:46 PM - Collin Hurst: The thing I'm worried about is a travel trip vs a destination trip will be so much harder to organize with 9 people
11/7/19, 1:47 PM - Collin Hurst: 500 will be hard
11/7/19, 1:59 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah destination trip >>>
11/7/19, 2:19 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
11/7/19, 2:20 PM - Tim Ko: It’s not where we go, it’s the people we are with 🙂
11/7/19, 2:20 PM - Tim Ko: That’s my quote of the day
11/7/19, 2:22 PM - Darren: Fuck you tim
11/7/19, 2:23 PM - Tim Ko: Haha
11/7/19, 2:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: Even the grand loop trip is coming out to about $800
11/7/19, 2:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: The doc is slowly populating if anyone else feels like helping
11/7/19, 2:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Op here comes Alex
11/7/19, 2:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: <Media omitted>
11/7/19, 2:28 PM - Collin Hurst: Is Hawaii on there? Hawaii sounds good
11/7/19, 2:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hawaii housing was expensive
11/7/19, 2:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: About $1200 for the trip
11/7/19, 2:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: I added in an activity budget but that one was tougher
11/7/19, 2:30 PM - Parker: yeah that ones hard to gauge
11/7/19, 2:30 PM - Parker: like you can’t predict losing $500 in a casino in vegas
11/7/19, 2:31 PM - Matt Casali: Yes you can: 100%
11/7/19, 2:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: Or the $1000 back from betting it all on the corners
11/7/19, 2:34 PM - Parker: Or a mountie stopping us in Banff chargng us $100 each for a moose tax
11/7/19, 2:35 PM - Matt Casali: We've got too many mooses
11/7/19, 2:48 PM - Collin Hurst: We could do airbnbs in Hawaii for 20/night each
11/7/19, 2:49 PM - Collin Hurst: Although I'd be down to find a local village and sleep on a banana leaf too
11/7/19, 3:01 PM - Alex Starr: I saw estimates at 900
11/7/19, 3:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Where
11/7/19, 3:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Cheapest I could find were hostels
11/7/19, 3:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: Also looking on Honolulu bc the flight is cheapest 2go there
11/7/19, 3:04 PM - Collin Hurst: Let's boat there
11/7/19, 3:07 PM - Alex Starr: What are some say 600 dollar options that aren’t road trips (driving is fine but the big drive should just be to one place e.g. drive to Vegas)
11/7/19, 3:08 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz I can’t think of any other than Tahoe/Vegas
11/7/19, 3:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: It’s the 7 days that kills us
11/7/19, 3:08 PM - Vaughn: When is a proposed departure month?
11/7/19, 3:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: Living for 7 days at home is expensive on its own
11/7/19, 3:09 PM - Alex Starr: Late mid June
11/7/19, 3:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: Commencement is like the 14th of June so about a week after
11/7/19, 3:09 PM - Alex Starr: ^
11/7/19, 3:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: Or somewhere about
11/7/19, 3:11 PM - Tim Ko: I hear there may be super cheap flights to Barcelona
11/7/19, 3:11 PM - Tim Ko: Like $180 round trip
11/7/19, 3:11 PM - Alex Starr: Idk where you hear that holy shit
11/7/19, 3:12 PM - Tim Ko: My friend told me about it cuz we where thinking of places to go during spring break
11/7/19, 3:12 PM - Tim Ko: Some budget airline
11/7/19, 3:12 PM - Tim Ko: Dates are pretty inflexible this
11/7/19, 3:12 PM - Tim Ko: Tho
11/7/19, 3:12 PM - Alex Starr: Cheapest I’ve seen is like 700 and my family looked a lot
11/7/19, 3:12 PM - Alex Starr: Ah
11/7/19, 3:13 PM - Tim Ko: Like he found one that leaves Thursday before spring break and comes back Tuesday of spring break
11/7/19, 3:13 PM - Alex Starr: We will keep it in mind
11/7/19, 3:14 PM - Alex Starr: Wait tim u said June was fine right?
11/7/19, 3:15 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah
11/7/19, 3:15 PM - Tim Ko: I think if we are very flexible on dates, we can find super cheap flights
11/7/19, 3:15 PM - Tim Ko: To cool places like Europe
11/7/19, 3:15 PM - Alex Starr: But we can’t be that flexible on dates unless it’s super far in advance
11/7/19, 3:16 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz I will very likely be working and so will many others I think
11/7/19, 3:18 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah for sure
11/7/19, 3:18 PM - Tim Ko: I’ll look for some cheap flights
11/7/19, 3:18 PM - Alex Starr: Look to Hawaii
11/7/19, 3:18 PM - Tim Ko: Maybe, I was there this past year tho lol
11/7/19, 3:18 PM - Tim Ko: If we fly I’m more down for Europe
11/7/19, 3:19 PM - Alex Starr: I think Europe is pretty out on price alone
11/7/19, 3:19 PM - Alex Starr: Ya I’ve been some too but I think it’d be way different with us
11/7/19, 3:24 PM - Tim Ko: Hawaii is just warm weather with beaches
11/7/19, 3:24 PM - Tim Ko: And good Japanese food
11/7/19, 3:25 PM - Darren: nice hikes
11/7/19, 3:25 PM - Darren: snorkelling
11/7/19, 3:25 PM - Darren: competitions for wind ensemble to win
11/7/19, 3:26 PM - Alex Starr: Oahu has a ton of night life stuff
11/7/19, 3:26 PM - Alex Starr: I’d prefer Europe too Tim but have come to terms
11/7/19, 3:27 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah
11/7/19, 3:27 PM - Tim Ko: Well if we get super cheap flights to Europe
11/7/19, 3:27 PM - Tim Ko: May actually end up cheaper than Hawaii
11/7/19, 3:27 PM - Tim Ko: Can air bnb in Spain for pretty cheap
11/7/19, 3:28 PM - Collin Hurst: Mexico is cheap
11/7/19, 3:29 PM - Collin Hurst: Pretty much Hawaii
11/7/19, 3:29 PM - Collin Hurst: And we can have a car
11/7/19, 3:42 PM - Matt Casali: In 100% honesty, I'm only really down for contiguous US or canada stuff
11/7/19, 3:43 PM - Collin Hurst: cause of cost?
11/7/19, 3:45 PM - Matt Casali: Not completely but yeah that's part of it
11/7/19, 3:46 PM - Alex Starr: What’s the other part
11/7/19, 3:46 PM - Matt Casali: Basically what I said earlier about why I dont wanna go to hawaii
11/7/19, 3:46 PM - Alex Starr: I mean
11/7/19, 3:46 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t want to go to Utah for similar reasons.
11/7/19, 3:46 PM - Collin Hurst: but won't we be a tourist anywhere we go unless we know someone in the area?
11/7/19, 3:47 PM - Alex Starr: Also let’s do July
11/7/19, 3:47 PM - Matt Casali: Theres a difference between Seattle and Cancun in that respect
11/7/19, 3:48 PM - Collin Hurst: Cause of the tourism economy thing?
11/7/19, 3:48 PM - Darren: seattle also makes cash money without tourism
11/7/19, 3:49 PM - Darren: but I also don't really care about the tourism is bad claim in the context of this trip
11/7/19, 3:50 PM - Matt Casali: Basically, yeah. I'm not saying that you guys necessarily should care, just that I do and I dont wanna participate in it cause it'll make me feel really weird
11/7/19, 3:51 PM - Alex Starr: So then we are effectively forced to care
11/7/19, 3:51 PM - Collin Hurst: im still a little confused by that, wouldn't you want to help a struggling economy by going and being a tourist?
11/7/19, 3:52 PM - Darren: the longer an economy leans on being a tourist attraction, the harder it is for it to pivot away from that in the future
11/7/19, 3:53 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah
11/7/19, 3:53 PM - Darren: and something about whoring out culture and its all "fake"
11/7/19, 3:53 PM - Collin Hurst: interesting
11/7/19, 3:53 PM - Alex Starr: Everyone is so anti whoring for some reason
11/7/19, 3:53 PM - Matt Casali: That I dont care about as much, I'm not concerned with experiencing the 'real' part of the country
11/7/19, 3:53 PM - Collin Hurst: makes sense but I disagree
11/7/19, 3:53 PM - Matt Casali: Cause lots of times that turns out worse haha
11/7/19, 3:55 PM - Alex Starr: I feel like some compromise here may be necessary or at least advisable
11/7/19, 3:56 PM - Collin Hurst: or we could do a small roadtrip and then send matt back on a plane while we go to hawaii or mexico
11/7/19, 3:56 PM - Collin Hurst: or just fuk matt
11/7/19, 3:56 PM - Collin Hurst: jkjk
11/7/19, 3:56 PM - Collin Hurst: unless?
11/7/19, 3:56 PM - Alex Starr: But it does show nicely how we are forced to care
11/7/19, 3:57 PM - Collin Hurst: i would go to hawaii over spending a few days with matt sorry bud
11/7/19, 3:57 PM - Parker: you can find cheap ones i’ll look on the sites i looked at from this pst summer
11/7/19, 3:57 PM - Alex Starr: But not sub 500 cheap
11/7/19, 3:57 PM - Parker: my flight going to spain was like 300
11/7/19, 3:58 PM - Alex Starr: How about back?
11/7/19, 3:58 PM - Parker: My mom booked it so i’m not sure but i can ask
11/7/19, 3:58 PM - Alex Starr: I think there is also something to be said about experiencing a different culture.
11/7/19, 3:58 PM - Parker: ^
11/7/19, 3:58 PM - Parker: Hawaii is a different culture
11/7/19, 3:58 PM - Collin Hurst: wait genius lets just have our moms book the flights
11/7/19, 3:58 PM - Collin Hurst: then its a lot cheaper
11/7/19, 3:58 PM - Parker: Hawaiian food is so dank though
11/7/19, 3:58 PM - Collin Hurst: that is a big nod from me
11/7/19, 3:59 PM - Alex Starr: And if I hadn’t touristed in Paris, I wouldn’t have gotten into baking
11/7/19, 3:59 PM - Parker: with your best friends!!!
11/7/19, 3:59 PM - Parker: facts
11/7/19, 3:59 PM - Matt Casali: For sure, but what frame are you going into it with, and whose gonna be gaining from it?
11/7/19, 3:59 PM - Alex Starr: 1. Frame?
2. Me.
11/7/19, 3:59 PM - Parker: If you’re not a dick while you’re there, then both sides should benefit
11/7/19, 4:00 PM - Parker: People in spain loves americans
11/7/19, 4:00 PM - Parker: loved
11/7/19, 4:00 PM - Matt Casali: Europe is different
11/7/19, 4:00 PM - Alex Starr: Why tho
11/7/19, 4:00 PM - Matt Casali: It wasnt colonized
11/7/19, 4:00 PM - Alex Starr: Spain doesn’t have an economy
11/7/19, 4:00 PM - Alex Starr: Well it just wasn’t colonized as recently
11/7/19, 4:01 PM - Alex Starr: Spain has had the shit colonized out of it
11/7/19, 4:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: What amount of tourism is ok?
11/7/19, 4:01 PM - Alex Starr: The okay amount.  Duh.
11/7/19, 4:02 PM - Jason Greenberg: Damn got me
11/7/19, 4:02 PM - Matt Casali: Haha
11/7/19, 4:02 PM - Jason Greenberg: So we shouldn’t just stay in place?
11/7/19, 4:03 PM - Alex Starr: We definitely shouldn’t.  If you google colonist it shows up with me giving a thumbs up and small pox to the natives.
11/7/19, 4:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha
11/7/19, 4:04 PM - Alex Starr: Wait hear me out.  Japan was never colonized.
11/7/19, 4:04 PM - Alex Starr: Tokyo 2020 ftw
11/7/19, 4:05 PM - Collin Hurst: im going^ that would save me some money if we went haha
11/7/19, 4:05 PM - Alex Starr: Is their a statute of limitations on colonization? Also more serious question, would it have been better if Europe never came to those places?  All of modernity wiped out in those countries?
11/7/19, 4:06 PM - Darren: yo fuck the US
11/7/19, 4:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: Just when it couldn’t get more woke
11/7/19, 4:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: Guys we should ask Chanti to plan our trip
11/7/19, 4:07 PM - Darren: I don't really want to vacation into my own subconscious
11/7/19, 4:07 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah some fucker colonized it
11/7/19, 4:08 PM - Darren: yeah I have a dom
11/7/19, 4:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: That is a callback ladies and gents
11/7/19, 4:08 PM - Matt Casali: Modernity is relative
11/7/19, 4:08 PM - Matt Casali: And yes many believe it would be better
11/7/19, 4:08 PM - Darren: this is a tribute
11/7/19, 4:08 PM - Matt Casali: Unless there was some chance that we just decided to colonize later and annihilate them
11/7/19, 4:09 PM - Matt Casali: Back on subject..
11/7/19, 4:09 PM - Alex Starr: Wait so no power no steam engines life expectancy in the 30s is better?
11/7/19, 4:09 PM - Darren: this conversation is spiralling
11/7/19, 4:10 PM - Matt Casali: If you guys decide that you all wanna go somewhere that I'm not down for, I'll think about and let ya know if I'm down to join, but I'll keep pushing for a domestic trip
11/7/19, 4:10 PM - Alex Starr: That’s fair.  It seems aggressive to outright ban, but negotiation is fair.
11/7/19, 4:11 PM - Parker: Olympics gang!!!
11/7/19, 4:11 PM - Alex Starr: Okay no
11/7/19, 4:11 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t want to waste Tokyo time watching some fucker jump kinda high
11/7/19, 4:11 PM - Alex Starr: Damn this is spiraling
11/7/19, 4:11 PM - Alex Starr: I think we can do Hawaii for 1000
11/7/19, 4:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: Japan was the most expensive trip by my estimation
11/7/19, 4:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: Unless we find a magic one under 1000
11/7/19, 4:12 PM - Alex Starr: But the least colonized
11/7/19, 4:12 PM - Collin Hurst: Tokyo Olympics is aggressively expensive
11/7/19, 4:13 PM - Collin Hurst: Hawaii still best option 😁
11/7/19, 4:13 PM - Alex Starr: I kinda wanna hear if Ricky is game for Hawaii
11/7/19, 4:14 PM - Alex Starr: Does anyone have a reliable way of contacting him?
11/7/19, 4:14 PM - Alex Starr: Jason could you cosplay as grace? I think that’s our best shot
11/7/19, 4:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: He’s coming to Sb in two weeks so I’ll have an audience with him
11/7/19, 4:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: Sit tight till then
11/7/19, 4:15 PM - Darren: Attending Ricky's office hours
11/7/19, 4:15 PM - Alex Starr: They are always too crowded
11/7/19, 4:16 PM - Alex Starr: Well this went nowhere
11/7/19, 4:16 PM - Alex Starr: Just like us in July if we don’t figure this out.
11/7/19, 4:18 PM - Alex Starr: We actually should do July my family may be doing stuff mid late June
11/7/19, 4:19 PM - Parker: I have no idea when i’ll be free as of rn
11/7/19, 4:19 PM - Parker: yerrr
11/7/19, 4:19 PM - Alex Starr: Sounds like July
11/7/19, 4:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: What if we invited Barry and some of your other family members by phone screen to come? Then you would be free
11/7/19, 4:21 PM - Alex Starr: I’m lost
11/7/19, 4:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: Star family + herd family = mid July trip
11/7/19, 4:25 PM - Alex Starr: I do go free then
11/7/19, 4:26 PM - Collin Hurst: I do also want to go on a camping trip with y'all sometime
11/7/19, 4:26 PM - Collin Hurst: Still waiting for thag
11/7/19, 4:27 PM - Darren: god's rainy dick incoming
11/7/19, 4:28 PM - Matt Casali: Herd trip 2020
11/7/19, 4:28 PM - Matt Casali: Backpacking in sequoia
11/7/19, 4:28 PM - Darren: /o\
11/7/19, 4:29 PM - Alex Starr: Not a lot of good food there. Or things to do.
11/7/19, 4:30 PM - Alex Starr: And big trees only get you so far
11/7/19, 4:30 PM - Collin Hurst: Im down but maybe not as the official trip
11/7/19, 4:35 PM - Jason Greenberg: Same but same
11/7/19, 4:48 PM - Alex Starr: I was aiming for that sentiment as well
11/7/19, 5:31 PM - Tim Ko: The thing is Matt, any place u go no matter what u do is supporting their tourist economy
11/7/19, 5:31 PM - Tim Ko: Unless u absolutely do nothing while ur at that place
11/7/19, 5:32 PM - Tim Ko: Even if we visited sf and paid for parkin at the Golden Gate Bridge, we supporting the tourist economy
11/7/19, 5:32 PM - Matt Casali: Again, SF is much different than somewhere in the global south for example
11/7/19, 5:33 PM - Tim Ko: But in principle ur supporting the same industry
11/7/19, 5:34 PM - Matt Casali: Tourism in and of itself isnt bad, that's not my argument
11/7/19, 5:34 PM - Matt Casali: Def cringey sometimes, but not always bad
11/7/19, 5:34 PM - Matt Casali: It's the type of tourism that occurs in places like Hawaii or Bali or Cancun that I dont agree with
11/7/19, 5:35 PM - Alex Starr: Random somewhat off topic, what do you think of the observatory?
11/7/19, 5:36 PM - Matt Casali: It shouldn't be built
11/7/19, 5:37 PM - Alex Starr: Interesting.  Why?
11/7/19, 5:39 PM - Matt Casali: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/08/21/mauna-kea-tmt-protests-hawaii-native-rights-telescope/1993037001/
11/7/19, 5:39 PM - Alex Starr: I kinda wanted your words but I’ll take that
11/7/19, 5:40 PM - Matt Casali: I'm not nearly as eloquent or concise
11/7/19, 5:41 PM - Tim Ko: So you’re just gonna avoid going to places like that?
11/7/19, 5:41 PM - Tim Ko: What about Europe then?
11/7/19, 5:42 PM - Matt Casali: Depends on where but Paris is like SF in that respect
11/7/19, 5:43 PM - Alex Starr: Might agree with it if it wasn’t a religious disagreement.  Kinda asked myself, what if a church was there?
11/7/19, 5:47 PM - Matt Casali: For sure it's a difficult problem with a lot at stake and multi-faceted, but I kinda boil it down to: theres a huge (governmental) institution trying to encroach on the rights and cultural history of a community that's already been wrecked by the US
11/7/19, 5:48 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah I tend to try to make this decisions with a “what if it were Europeans” sorta thing
11/7/19, 5:49 PM - Matt Casali: Well it seems like local communities should have the ultimate say
11/7/19, 5:49 PM - Matt Casali: But also those things dont work both ways like that
11/7/19, 5:50 PM - Alex Starr: They do for me.
11/7/19, 5:51 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah I just disagree with that which is I think the ultimate difference.  Local communities won’t vaccinate, local communities will pollute, local communities will insist on holding county fairs, larger organizational intervention can stop that
11/7/19, 5:53 PM - Alex Starr: And Matt I agree with you tourism has mixed possibly net negative effects, but two things:
1. It can have extremely positive effects.  Tourists matter too, my best memories are probably as a tourist.
2. Shutting down tourism moves away from globalization.  It seems to close borders instead of opening them.  A temporary good as part of a trend that is much worse.
11/7/19, 5:58 PM - Matt Casali: Global tourism is only good for the people who have historically profited off of it. Like, I'm glad you had a good experience, but at what cost to the people who live there, have lived there and will live there
11/7/19, 5:58 PM - Alex Starr: Right what is the cost
11/7/19, 5:59 PM - Alex Starr: I would argue that only is a pretty strong statement.  There are pretty undeniably some positive effects
11/7/19, 6:03 PM - Matt Casali: Positive from this standpoint usually means something like modernization, which is not positive from most indigenous points of view
11/7/19, 6:04 PM - Alex Starr: What is that based on?
11/7/19, 6:05 PM - Matt Casali: I've been doing a lot of reading on mesoamerican indigenous communities this quarter and just what I've heard from other people that have taken classes on colonialization in other parts of the world and like environmental justice
11/7/19, 6:05 PM - Matt Casali: Lots of places for sure
11/7/19, 6:06 PM - Alex Starr: Definitely the Americas, debatably Hawaii
11/7/19, 6:06 PM - Alex Starr: But we can’t really avoid being in America
11/7/19, 6:06 PM - Matt Casali: Hawaii hates our asses haha
11/7/19, 6:07 PM - Alex Starr: 44% of native Hawaiians are pro telescope
11/7/19, 6:07 PM - Matt Casali: Oh no way, but we can be conscious of what it means to be american and how we can begin to not perpetuate bad cycles
11/7/19, 6:08 PM - Darren: To quote Eisenhower, "sucks to suck"
11/7/19, 6:08 PM - Matt Casali: Most of those are probably young people who are being incorporated into the colonial system which is very common especially in the Americas
11/7/19, 6:09 PM - Alex Starr: I again don’t think incorporation/globalization are bad
11/7/19, 6:10 PM - Matt Casali: Erasure of culture and diversity is never a good thing
11/7/19, 6:10 PM - Alex Starr: Genital mutilation?
11/7/19, 6:10 PM - Matt Casali: What
11/7/19, 6:10 PM - Alex Starr: That’s culture
11/7/19, 6:10 PM - Alex Starr: Should we erase it? Or let it be? Obviously an extreme example
11/7/19, 6:10 PM - Alex Starr: But if I can’t convince you of that I got nothing haha
11/7/19, 6:11 PM - Matt Casali: We should let that community work on its problems within itself
11/7/19, 6:11 PM - Alex Starr: Even if that means millions of girls are raped?
11/7/19, 6:12 PM - Matt Casali: Why is our say so important and why are we supposed to save them? Why dont they have the capacity to help themselves like we did?
11/7/19, 6:12 PM - Matt Casali: Or are trying to do
11/7/19, 6:12 PM - Alex Starr: That doesn’t answer the question
11/7/19, 6:13 PM - Matt Casali: Well, it's also an extreme example that involves so many different issues that I'm not gonna be able to apply this specific point to it
11/7/19, 6:13 PM - Matt Casali: Obviously a global communication isnt bad
11/7/19, 6:14 PM - Matt Casali: But its unbalanced and that's bad
11/7/19, 6:14 PM - Alex Starr: Just want a yes or no on should we intervene in cultures that commit genocide/mass genital manipulation etc.
11/7/19, 6:14 PM - Alex Starr: As a starting point
11/7/19, 6:14 PM - Matt Casali: Idk
11/7/19, 6:14 PM - Matt Casali: Probably?
11/7/19, 6:14 PM - Alex Starr: I’ll take it
11/7/19, 6:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: Got em
11/7/19, 6:15 PM - Matt Casali: You understand what I'm saying though right
11/7/19, 6:15 PM - Alex Starr: One more time to be sure
11/7/19, 6:15 PM - Matt Casali: Ah yes, he proved that white saviorism is justified hurray
11/7/19, 6:16 PM - Matt Casali: Its there for you to read haha
11/7/19, 6:16 PM - Alex Starr: Point to a specific message or group of messages.
11/7/19, 6:16 PM - Matt Casali: You guys can do the reading on your own too, I'm 100% not gonna be able to explain all of this to you
11/7/19, 6:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: Sorry I wasn’t trying to bait you Matt
11/7/19, 6:17 PM - Matt Casali: Idk I think I'm just really surprised that you guys dont trust in these types of things that I'm saying just because I've heard it a million times from professors, students and friends
11/7/19, 6:17 PM - Matt Casali: So everything that's said here kinda feels like a bait
11/7/19, 6:18 PM - Matt Casali: Whether intended or not
11/7/19, 6:18 PM - Matt Casali: It stresses me out and I need a break
11/7/19, 6:18 PM - Alex Starr: It’s not a lack of trust.  It’s a disagreement
11/7/19, 6:18 PM - Matt Casali: Which is why I encourage you all to read more about this stuff
11/7/19, 6:18 PM - Alex Starr: You can trust two sides and weigh things differently
11/7/19, 6:18 PM - Matt Casali: On your own
11/7/19, 6:18 PM - Jason Greenberg: Right you guys are analyzing ambiguous info
11/7/19, 6:32 PM - Alex Starr: So if I’m reading the doc right, SE Asia is only 300 dollars more than grand loop?
11/7/19, 6:32 PM - Vaughn: Quicktake on tourism, its not going away. I dont see a path in which not embracing tourism could help any of those counties economies. For every touristic place you go to, there will always be sustainable tourism activities to do which nudges tourism in the right direction
11/7/19, 6:44 PM - Parker: I don’t think of it as a bad thing, tourism creates a crazy amount of jobs in a lot of places and in most cases, promotes a cross cultural understanding
11/7/19, 6:45 PM - Parker: i read something from my management class that i’m in rn that tourism creates one out of 10 jobs worldwide
11/7/19, 6:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: Give or take
11/7/19, 6:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: It gets cheap when you get there
11/7/19, 7:02 PM - Alex Starr: Worth keeping in mind that it can be cheaper to stay somewhere for 6 nights than two stay 3 different places for 2
11/7/19, 7:45 PM - Alex Starr: Plus the food is way better
11/7/19, 9:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: Cancun coming in under $1000
11/7/19, 9:46 PM - Collin Hurst: 👀
11/7/19, 9:46 PM - Alex Starr: Hawaii >>>
11/7/19, 9:49 PM - Collin Hurst: ^still #1
11/7/19, 10:47 PM - Parker: I’m super down for either
11/7/19, 10:47 PM - Parker: Cancun would be lit
11/7/19, 10:57 PM - Tim Ko: Cancun would be the far superior option (based on price and what we could do), but less safe
11/7/19, 10:58 PM - Matt Casali: Seattle's sounding pretty damn good
11/7/19, 11:00 PM - Collin Hurst: Meh to me, just another us city
11/7/19, 11:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’ve been there a bunch
11/7/19, 11:01 PM - Matt Casali: Cancun is meh to me, just another place in mexico
11/7/19, 11:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: Not excited
11/7/19, 11:01 PM - Collin Hurst: exactly mexico
11/7/19, 11:01 PM - Collin Hurst: ay caramba
11/7/19, 11:01 PM - Darren: It's la bamba
11/7/19, 11:02 PM - Jason Greenberg: Make you do the samba
11/7/19, 11:15 PM - Matt Casali: In case anyone isn't doing enough school work:
11/7/19, 11:15 PM - Matt Casali: http://www.seagrant.umn.edu/tourism/pdfs/ImpactsTourism.pdf
11/7/19, 11:16 PM - Matt Casali: file:///C:/Users/casal/Downloads/sustainability-11-00840-v2.pdf
11/7/19, 11:16 PM - Matt Casali: second link may not work
11/7/19, 11:16 PM - Darren: That's a link to a local file
11/7/19, 11:16 PM - Matt Casali: Title is "Sociocultural Impacts of Tourism on Residents of World Cultural Heritage Sites in China"
11/7/19, 11:16 PM - Darren: Fuck China
11/7/19, 11:16 PM - Collin Hurst: ^
11/7/19, 11:17 PM - Matt Casali: It uses China as a case study that's all
11/7/19, 11:17 PM - Collin Hurst: so we just shouldn't ever visit other countries? idk bout that
11/7/19, 11:17 PM - Matt Casali: I think you should read the papers and what they're saying before coming to that conclusion about them
11/7/19, 11:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: This is 20 pages
11/7/19, 11:18 PM - Jason Greenberg: I honestly would have read it if it was under 5
11/7/19, 11:18 PM - Matt Casali: 🤷‍♂
11/7/19, 11:19 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah gonna have to pass on 20 pages
11/7/19, 11:19 PM - Matt Casali: One Abstract: The development of tourism induces changes in the social character of a destination.
Tourism is a globalized business activity and thus presents growing challenges in terms of traditional
social culture. With the continuous development of the tourism industry, traditional social culture has
changed dramatically at many World Heritage sites (WHSs). Additionally, the growing dependence
of many regions’ economies on the tourism industry has brought about an inexorable shift in the
perception of many rural residents. These transformations include the impact of tourism development
and its economic efficiency on inhabitants’ traditional values, lifestyles, and interpersonal relationship
in ancient villages serving as WHSs. A qualitative analysis including participatory in-depth
interviews was conducted to compare changes in the social culture induced by tourism development
at the WHS comprising three ancient villages in China. Furthermore, a qualitative content analysis
was chosen to examine the impact of tourism development on residents’ perceptions of changes in
moral values. The results demonstrate that tourism development is the major catalyst for change in
local residents’ moral values.
11/7/19, 11:19 PM - Darren: That's 55% of the length of my midterm
11/7/19, 11:19 PM - Collin Hurst: if the impact can't be explained in under 20 pages, its invalid
11/7/19, 11:19 PM - Collin Hurst: I saw that somewhere
11/7/19, 11:19 PM - Tim Ko: I don’t think getting rid of tourism solves the problem tho...
11/7/19, 11:20 PM - Darren: Ok gents
11/7/19, 11:20 PM - Darren: Don't discredit the case study without reading it
11/7/19, 11:20 PM - Darren: But also, don't read it if you don't want to
11/7/19, 11:20 PM - Matt Casali: ^
11/7/19, 11:20 PM - Matt Casali: ^
11/7/19, 11:20 PM - Tim Ko: Economies won’t magically get better if we end tourism lol
11/7/19, 11:21 PM - Collin Hurst: also, whats wrong with change
11/7/19, 11:21 PM - Matt Casali: If you guys wanna try to understand where I'm coming from you can read it
11/7/19, 11:21 PM - Matt Casali: I don't really know how else to give a better argument here
11/7/19, 11:21 PM - Darren: Nothing, it was a fantastic demo and won iPads
11/7/19, 11:21 PM - Collin Hurst: ture
11/7/19, 11:22 PM - Collin Hurst: true
11/7/19, 11:23 PM - Parker: i go there half a dozen times a year so it’s gonna be a no from me dog
11/7/19, 11:23 PM - Parker: I do love seattle though
11/7/19, 11:24 PM - Matt Casali: http://www.albasud.org/publ/docs/32.en.pdf
11/7/19, 11:24 PM - Matt Casali: pg 21-24
11/7/19, 11:25 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah idk just going to another west coast city wouldnt be celebrate-ending-school vibes for me
11/7/19, 11:25 PM - Tim Ko: I just skimmed through ur first link
11/7/19, 11:25 PM - Matt Casali: pretty good job of outlining the specific problems with tourism, specifically in South America
11/7/19, 11:25 PM - Tim Ko: It doesn’t completely go against tourism
11/7/19, 11:25 PM - Tim Ko: Just says we need to plan and consider factors in order to do it right
11/7/19, 11:26 PM - Parker: and this
11/7/19, 11:26 PM - Tim Ko: Well, for me and alex we this isn’t the “end” of school for ur hahaha
11/7/19, 11:26 PM - Tim Ko: *us
11/7/19, 11:26 PM - Matt Casali: I recommend looking at this
11/7/19, 11:26 PM - Tim Ko: Not jason probably
11/7/19, 11:26 PM - Tim Ko: *nor
11/7/19, 11:26 PM - Collin Hurst: oh yeah lol
11/7/19, 11:28 PM - Tim Ko: Again, it doesn’t talk about banning tourism
11/7/19, 11:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: While the nuance of this argument may be lost on me, the problem I have with it is that it isn’t putting the problem in perspective with the larger issue, which is globalization. Its a stance that’s zoomed in enough to oversimplify the situation into good and bad and doesn’t really acknowledge the benefits of or the reason for a globalized world.
11/7/19, 11:29 PM - Collin Hurst: what is the solution that they are proposing if any?
11/7/19, 11:29 PM - Tim Ko: Idk, new models of tourism, didn’t read close enough for any specifics
11/7/19, 11:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: Like I’m down to talk about the problems with tourism but it’s not a closed loop
11/8/19, 12:28 AM - Vaughn: Go watch jojo rabbit if you havnt seen it!
11/8/19, 12:28 AM - Darren: Is it in theaters?
11/8/19, 12:29 AM - Vaughn: Yessir! Just got back from it absolutely loved it
11/8/19, 12:41 AM - Darren: How would you describe it?
11/8/19, 12:43 AM - Vaughn: Silly satirical nazi movie with the best child acting ive ever seen
11/8/19, 12:54 AM - Darren: Thor Ragnarok like?
11/8/19, 6:46 AM - Alex Starr: 5 more years 5 more years
11/8/19, 6:47 AM - Alex Starr: Which one had that abstract Matt?
11/8/19, 7:03 AM - Alex Starr: This paper doesn’t say whether it is net negative or positive
11/8/19, 8:14 AM - Ricky: Yooooo I wanna watch that! Looks so funny
11/8/19, 1:31 PM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
11/8/19, 1:46 PM - Vaughn: You really need to chill alex
11/8/19, 1:48 PM - Parker: Tim too jesus
11/8/19, 1:48 PM - Parker: relax tim
11/8/19, 1:56 PM - Vaughn: <Media omitted>
11/8/19, 2:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: <Media omitted>
11/8/19, 2:04 PM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
11/8/19, 2:11 PM - Alex Starr: I’m working on it damn
11/8/19, 2:13 PM - Vaughn: Hahaha i like how the audios autoplay
11/8/19, 5:13 PM - Ricky: <Media omitted>
11/8/19, 8:33 PM - Matt Casali: Just wanted to say that I thought about it a lot last night and I realize that drawing the line as hard as I was is unreasonable and that I shouldn't rule out all trips to any foreign/previously colonized region because there are ways to experience places in a respectful fashion
11/8/19, 8:33 PM - Matt Casali: I'm still not down for Hawaii or someplace like Cancun because its incredibly hard to do that there, but I'll try to keep looking for more things that I want to do and won't shut down like I was last night
11/8/19, 8:48 PM - Alex Starr: I think you handled it reasonably well considering there wasn’t a lot of agreement.  At least for me, it really threw me cuz it seems like Hawaii is the perfect choice and I’m so very pro globalization.
11/8/19, 8:49 PM - Alex Starr: I really think Hawaii would be a ton of fun and doing it on Oahu would have a pretty limited effect.
11/8/19, 9:25 PM - Collin Hurst: Problem is that a lot of us want a different cultural experience which is hard to find for cheap, and Mexico is one of the only ones on that list
11/8/19, 9:28 PM - Alex Starr: And it’s not a huge cultural leap considering we’ve learned a lot about it
11/8/19, 10:25 PM - Tim Ko: U good man, glad u voiced ur opinions
11/9/19, 9:03 AM - Alex Starr: Fun fact we could rent a car/van in Hawaii
11/9/19, 9:06 AM - Collin Hurst: 👀👀
11/9/19, 9:30 AM - Alex Starr: Minimum age is 21
11/9/19, 9:32 AM - Alex Starr: Means we could travel to north shore see the waves, best snorkeling areas.  Would be a huge win.
11/9/19, 9:52 AM - Collin Hurst: Two big items for me in Hawaii would be surf without a wetsuit and spearfishing
11/9/19, 9:53 AM - Ricky: Haha wtf
11/9/19, 9:53 AM - Alex Starr: Spear fishing is costly af
11/9/19, 9:53 AM - Ricky: That’s crazy
11/9/19, 9:53 AM - Alex Starr: But I’m probably game
11/9/19, 9:54 AM - Collin Hurst: Costly if we do a whole guide thing but I'm down to just wing it
11/9/19, 9:54 AM - Ricky: I’m scuba certified if we go to a place that could do it if anyone else is, but I know that’s big cash
11/9/19, 9:54 AM - Ricky: Hahaha is that legal?
11/9/19, 9:54 AM - Collin Hurst: Just need permit
11/9/19, 9:54 AM - Collin Hurst: And a spear gun
11/9/19, 10:06 AM - Alex Starr: Permits ain’t cheap
11/9/19, 10:06 AM - Alex Starr: Spear guns on the other hand are also not cheap
11/9/19, 10:49 AM - Parker: Lol
11/9/19, 11:16 AM - Parker: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 11:17 AM - Matt Casali: :/
11/9/19, 11:24 AM - Jason Greenberg: Did he go to jail?
11/9/19, 11:28 AM - Parker: i think so lol
11/9/19, 11:28 AM - Parker: Not for that long though
11/9/19, 7:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: Does anyone have the tim shooting stars meme?
11/9/19, 7:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: Tryna show Willem and Jason dong
11/9/19, 7:11 PM - Vaughn: Its on collins finsta
11/9/19, 7:14 PM - Vaughn: Wait nvm
11/9/19, 7:15 PM - Vaughn: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 7:23 PM - Matt Casali: Gold
11/9/19, 7:24 PM - Alex Starr: It’s so funny
11/9/19, 10:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: Beauty
11/9/19, 10:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: They both enjoyed it a lot

11/10/19, 2:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: People were down to do that in addition but the main Friendsgiving the sentiment was to cook
11/10/19, 2:40 PM - Alex Starr: Whoa whoa.  The 30th I could definitely make if I’m not in Utah.  80% chance I’m in Utah.
11/10/19, 2:41 PM - Alex Starr: Which believe me I don’t want to be in Utah, but feel somewhat obligated to support my grandfather
11/10/19, 2:48 PM - Parker: we should do this over christmas
11/10/19, 2:48 PM - Parker: i vote

11/10/19, 8:53 PM - Tim Ko: Just now I was at that 24/7 Indian supermarket in Sunnyvale next to Felipe’s fruit store with my mom and dad. We walked in to get the complementary chai tea for shoppers, planned to buy a couple samosas, but the line was too long. So we felt bad cuz all of us already got our chai teas and decided to buy a single small piece indian sweet for like 1$. As we finished buying, my mom spilled her chai tea all over the dessert glass display and we wanted to clean it up so we asked for paper but everyone ignored us so we just walked out 😂. TLDR: we walked in the store, got free chai tea, spilled chai tea all over the dessert glass display, and walked out. Don’t worry collin, us East Asians have each other’s back. This one was for u bud.
11/10/19, 8:56 PM - Collin Hurst: Lol what you mean you got my back hahaha
11/10/19, 8:57 PM - Parker: hahaha

11/11/19, 4:18 PM - Alex Starr: You know I would be one of the 12 people watching women’s collegiate basketball, but I’m not passed out on my couch while it plays in the background
11/11/19, 4:28 PM - Parker: I had the same mindset
11/11/19, 4:28 PM - Parker: Until i watched this team
11/11/19, 4:32 PM - Darren: All the excitement of watching JV guys basketball

11/11/19, 4:39 PM - Alex Starr: I could mention that I wouldn’t watch D-league basketball, but it’s a lost cause

11/12/19, 5:29 PM - Parker: The earthquakes just signed a 14 year old goalkeeper lol
11/12/19, 5:37 PM - Matt Casali: Something about that seems wrong haha
11/12/19, 5:37 PM - Matt Casali: I mean besides the fact that the earthquakes are SO bad that they sign a 14 year old goalkeeper lol
11/12/19, 5:38 PM - Collin Hurst: Why would that make then bad lol
11/12/19, 5:38 PM - Matt Casali: He's 14

11/12/19, 5:39 PM - Collin Hurst: They have unlimited roster
11/12/19, 5:39 PM - Matt Casali: Just also seems like a desperate move
11/12/19, 5:39 PM - Collin Hurst: Well it's not like they are going to actually play him in the next 5 years
11/12/19, 5:40 PM - Matt Casali: Ah

11/12/19, 5:44 PM - Alex Starr: College football players can get offers in middle school
11/12/19, 5:45 PM - Matt Casali: Seems weird to me
11/12/19, 5:46 PM - Matt Casali: I remember there was a rumor going around that chanti got recruited in middle school
11/12/19, 5:50 PM - Collin Hurst: Usually stuff like that is a verbal commit that the college can take away
11/12/19, 5:51 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah
11/12/19, 5:51 PM - Alex Starr: Is the earthquakes kid salaried?
11/12/19, 5:52 PM - Parker: it’s the exact opposite
11/12/19, 5:52 PM - Parker: atleast from a business perspective
11/12/19, 5:54 PM - Alex Starr: Eh it kinda is.  Desperately rebuilding
11/12/19, 5:54 PM - Alex Starr: But I see what you mean
11/12/19, 5:55 PM - Matt Casali: All I know is that the earthquakes suck
11/12/19, 5:56 PM - Matt Casali: And they're affiliated with wondolowksi
11/12/19, 5:56 PM - Matt Casali: And I hate wondolowski
11/12/19, 5:56 PM - Ricky: What about earfquakes?

11/12/19, 5:59 PM - Collin Hurst: With an army of 14 year olds
11/12/19, 6:00 PM - Darren: Imagine being their u16 or u19 academy keeper and they sign a 14 year old

11/21/19, 1:55 PM - Ricky: I’m confused why ur confused
11/21/19, 1:58 PM - Alex Starr: Seems like everyone knows about it, so I assumed some of us went to surprise him.
11/21/19, 1:59 PM - Ricky: I think just Darren knew and I’d assume from Willem and/or social media
11/21/19, 1:59 PM - Alex Starr: Social media was my bet as well but you never know
11/21/19, 2:04 PM - Tim Ko: Tbt when ricky surprised us at young’s party!
11/21/19, 2:06 PM - Darren: Willem asked me for advice for planning and then promptly ignored it
11/21/19, 2:09 PM - Ricky: Hahahaha
11/21/19, 2:09 PM - Ricky: Noice

11/21/19, 3:14 PM - Darren: Sticking to my Tahoe guns
11/21/19, 3:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: Sounds like a good day
11/21/19, 3:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: I don’t think Willem or Haley (his gf) smokes tho
11/21/19, 3:16 PM - Darren: Oh, he's still dating her?

11/22/19, 5:11 PM - Alex Starr: But can’t necessarily go anywhere cuz essays
11/22/19, 5:12 PM - Alex Starr: Right situation where I’d really like an excuse to not think about it, but also can’t really just up and leave
11/22/19, 5:15 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz 2 are ready to submit and it’ll only be a few hours to get the other 10 ready.

11/23/19, 3:40 PM - Alex Starr: I have some idea but have never played
11/23/19, 3:42 PM - Vaughn: Team of 2 each tosses a die pretty high up and try to land on the other half of the table. If it hits, other team has to catch the die with one hand so it doesnt touch the ground, otherwise tossers get a point
11/23/19, 3:43 PM - Vaughn: Rules are flexible on how much youre supposed to drink
11/23/19, 3:44 PM - Vaughn: Some cool rules like if the die isnt gunna hit the table, you can kick it into your teamates hand before it hits the ground for a point
11/23/19, 3:50 PM - Alex Starr: What if you make it in the cup
11/23/19, 3:51 PM - Vaughn: Chug your beer usually
11/23/19, 3:51 PM - Alex Starr: Makes sense

11/23/19, 4:04 PM - Matt Casali: Definitely way more involved
11/23/19, 4:04 PM - Matt Casali: But there needs to be more than 2 teams haha
11/23/19, 4:05 PM - Matt Casali: Collin and I lost a string of a couple games and I had never had so much beer
11/23/19, 4:24 PM - Vaughn: That beer was my dinner
11/23/19, 4:25 PM - Parker: Lmao yeah like 3-4 is good
11/23/19, 4:37 PM - Collin Hurst: We don't need to play where we drink every 4 points lmao
11/23/19, 4:41 PM - Alex Starr: What do I win? Another beer!

11/26/19, 7:39 PM - Matt Casali: I will repeat that I'd rather not, but will go where everyone goes
11/26/19, 7:39 PM - Darren: Santa Cruz houses would be dope
11/26/19, 7:40 PM - Matt Casali: Going to santa cruz I'm more against though
11/26/19, 7:40 PM - Alex Starr: However much Matt doesn’t want to, I want to slightly more.  Not enough for a clear cut decision, but enough to muddy the water and lean toward doing it
11/26/19, 7:41 PM - Matt Casali: And however much you want to do it increases my stubbornness by 10%
11/26/19, 7:42 PM - Alex Starr: This is a very stable system
11/26/19, 7:42 PM - Matt Casali: I dont wanna go to sc for saturday just to return the next morning
11/26/19, 7:42 PM - Matt Casali: And I dont wanna leave home essentially Saturday midday
11/26/19, 7:43 PM - Matt Casali: I am the induced emf to your changing magnetic field
11/26/19, 7:52 PM - Alex Starr: I was thinking predator prey or something.  Yeah how would doing at UCSC work? We probably wouldn’t cook but I could be swayed
11/26/19, 7:52 PM - Tim Ko: I’m down to hang with donz and the gang post Friendsgiving
11/26/19, 7:52 PM - Tim Ko: Haven’t seen them all in a while
11/26/19, 7:53 PM - Tim Ko: I also have a midterm to study for the Monday we get back from thanksgiving lol
11/26/19, 7:53 PM - Alex Starr: That’s what Utah is for
11/26/19, 7:57 PM - Matt Casali: I dont like that
11/26/19, 7:57 PM - Matt Casali: No to SC
11/26/19, 7:57 PM - Matt Casali: Please
11/26/19, 7:57 PM - Tim Ko: I would prefer not SC either
11/26/19, 7:58 PM - Alex Starr: I thought it was the predator prey thing and was confused
11/26/19, 7:58 PM - Matt Casali: If you guys wanna go to sc just visit us when you're out of school
11/26/19, 7:58 PM - Alex Starr: Maybe we can compromise do herdsgiving then depending on what Jason says the plan is potentially that
11/26/19, 7:58 PM - Matt Casali: It was all of it
11/26/19, 8:18 PM - Ricky: I texted Donya, she hasn’t asked fotus yet
11/26/19, 8:18 PM - Alex Starr: It’s just the example they always use for stable vs unstable systems
11/26/19, 8:18 PM - Ricky: And I’m down for sc winter break but thanksgiving not so much
11/26/19, 8:18 PM - Alex Starr: Sc over winter break a couple times.  It’s a huge win.

11/27/19, 8:51 PM - Collin Hurst: Still confirming, but communication is slow since she is working rn
11/27/19, 8:54 PM - Collin Hurst: One option is to have Tim dd maybe?
11/27/19, 8:55 PM - Matt Casali: Its okay I'll just have a couple glasses
11/27/19, 8:56 PM - Ricky: Well Tim can prob drive Collin and Vaughn back and I drive me back? But up to you

11/27/19, 9:00 PM - Collin Hurst: That's when we really go for it hehe
11/27/19, 9:01 PM - Matt Casali: Sounds good

11/27/19, 9:13 PM - Collin Hurst: So uh if you could pick some up thatd be great
11/27/19, 9:16 PM - Tim Ko: I won’t be consuming too much
11/27/19, 9:16 PM - Tim Ko: If trend holds, about half a bottle of beers worth of alc to be exact
11/27/19, 9:21 PM - Collin Hurst: Try my Asian glow pill
11/27/19, 9:24 PM - Tim Ko: Lol it did absolutely nothing last time
11/27/19, 9:26 PM - Collin Hurst: Cause you did it wrong boi
11/27/19, 9:33 PM - Alex Starr: ^
11/27/19, 10:04 PM - Parker: ^^
11/27/19, 10:04 PM - Parker: Lol
11/28/19, 9:10 AM - Ricky: I kept burping during the 5 k and it just smelled like wine, would not recommend
11/28/19, 9:28 AM - Jason Greenberg: Yum
11/28/19, 9:35 AM - Ricky: But I ran a sub 7min per mile :D

11/28/19, 5:11 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
11/28/19, 5:11 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
11/28/19, 5:11 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
11/28/19, 5:11 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
11/28/19, 5:43 PM - Alex Starr: Well played
11/28/19, 6:09 PM - Matt Casali: Quick poll: is pie or cake better? Compare best pie vs. best cake and worst pie vs. worst cake
11/28/19, 6:10 PM - Collin Hurst: Pie
11/28/19, 6:10 PM - Collin Hurst: Best pie is better than best cake
11/28/19, 6:10 PM - Collin Hurst: Worst cake is better than worst pie
11/28/19, 6:12 PM - Parker: i agree with collin
11/28/19, 6:25 PM - Alex Starr: Absolute fucking nonsense
11/28/19, 6:25 PM - Alex Starr: Pie is hands down the worst western dessert
11/28/19, 6:25 PM - Alex Starr: Tarts are delicious
11/28/19, 6:26 PM - Alex Starr: But pie is shit
11/28/19, 6:26 PM - Darren: Ok you need to calm down
11/28/19, 6:27 PM - Darren: But average cake > average pie imo
11/28/19, 6:28 PM - Collin Hurst: ^
11/28/19, 6:29 PM - Alex Starr: Nah pie is legitimately bad
11/28/19, 6:39 PM - Parker: ^
11/28/19, 6:39 PM - Parker: That’s full cap
11/28/19, 6:39 PM - Parker: you’ve lived a life of eating bad pies
11/28/19, 6:41 PM - Alex Starr: Untrue
11/28/19, 6:42 PM - Alex Starr: What pie do you guys like?  There’s always only one flavor and it’s overwhelmingly sweet
11/28/19, 6:50 PM - Parker: One flavor???
11/28/19, 6:51 PM - Parker: what kinda monsters are you eating with
11/28/19, 6:52 PM - Parker: A good pecan pie slaps, i like pumpkin but also get why people don’t, i’m not as high on fruit pies but im down for a good marionberry here and there
11/28/19, 6:52 PM - Alex Starr: All of those have only one flavor
11/28/19, 6:52 PM - Alex Starr: I meant that the pie itself has one flavor
11/28/19, 6:53 PM - Alex Starr: It’s a pumpkin pie
11/28/19, 6:53 PM - Alex Starr: Eh pecan pie is just a sugary mess
11/28/19, 6:53 PM - Parker: ?
11/28/19, 6:53 PM - Collin Hurst: The sweet potato pie I made with date whipped cream was an Uber nut
11/28/19, 6:53 PM - Darren: Kahlua cream cheese pie is fucking bomb
11/28/19, 6:53 PM - Parker: Not a good one
11/28/19, 6:53 PM - Collin Hurst: Pecan pie is gas
11/28/19, 6:53 PM - Tim Ko: I’m more of a cake person
11/28/19, 6:54 PM - Tim Ko: Tres leche > pie
11/28/19, 6:55 PM - Collin Hurst: Ok using tres leche as an example is just straight cheating
11/28/19, 6:55 PM - Darren: Shut up
11/28/19, 6:58 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t think I’m gonna be swayed here.  Pie is way too sweet and tends to have only one flavor.  I’d say cream cheese pie is really a cheesecake.
11/28/19, 6:58 PM - Alex Starr: I think the real takeaway is that you guys are living in a dark world filled with bad cake
11/28/19, 7:00 PM - Tim Ko: Would u rather have a wedding pie for ur wedding collin?
11/28/19, 7:00 PM - Darren: Tim you're dumb
11/28/19, 7:01 PM - Collin Hurst: That's just stupid
11/28/19, 7:01 PM - Darren: No one gets a wedding cake for it to taste good
11/28/19, 7:05 PM - Alex Starr: Tho they absolutely can
11/28/19, 7:05 PM - Parker: ok that’s not a good argument lol
11/28/19, 7:05 PM - Alex Starr: I just don’t think you guys have eaten enough cake
11/28/19, 7:05 PM - Parker: can you clarify what you mean by one flavor i’m so confused
11/28/19, 7:05 PM - Alex Starr: K what does pumpkin pie taste like?
11/28/19, 7:05 PM - Parker: do u mean the crust ? bc then that shits on your tarts too
11/28/19, 7:06 PM - Parker: Pumpkin?
11/28/19, 7:06 PM - Alex Starr: They are completely different.  Pie crust is flaky made with shortening and no sugar.  Tart crust is like a shortbread cookie
11/28/19, 7:06 PM - Alex Starr: K now what does opera cake taste like?
11/28/19, 7:06 PM - Alex Starr: Chocolate, butter, almond, and coffee
11/28/19, 7:06 PM - Alex Starr: It’s got 3-4 flavors
11/28/19, 7:06 PM - Alex Starr: Pumpkin pie has 1
11/28/19, 7:07 PM - Parker: More flavors =/ better quality
11/28/19, 7:07 PM - Parker: in some cases sure but not always
11/28/19, 7:08 PM - Alex Starr: I agree.  But I think that absolute top tier is the case when more flavors is necessary
11/28/19, 7:08 PM - Parker: I also am not looking for a burst of flavors after eating a huge ass meal
11/28/19, 7:08 PM - Parker: i’d order a cake over pie at a nice restaurant sure
11/28/19, 7:08 PM - Alex Starr: This wasn’t about thanksgiving
11/28/19, 7:08 PM - Alex Starr: It was strict cake vs pie
11/28/19, 7:08 PM - Tim Ko: I feel like a cake that expensive tastes good?
11/28/19, 7:08 PM - Tim Ko: Tho I haven’t been to a wedding since I was 5
11/28/19, 7:09 PM - Alex Starr: Plus if you count entremet as cake then it’s no contest
11/28/19, 7:09 PM - Alex Starr: It doesn’t necessarily.  Fondant is nasty and looks gorgeous and is on most wedding cakes.
11/28/19, 7:09 PM - Tim Ko: I see
11/28/19, 7:09 PM - Alex Starr: Plus to make it that big you are restricted in how structurally sound the cake is which can make things tricky
11/28/19, 7:10 PM - Alex Starr: A really light or really heavy cake would collapse
11/28/19, 7:10 PM - Parker: Yeah fondant makes it look pretty but is gross
11/28/19, 7:10 PM - Parker: or kinda tasteless
11/28/19, 7:10 PM - Alex Starr: It’s literally sugar cornstarch and water
11/28/19, 7:11 PM - Parker: True, but idk if i’m eating a pie i’m not looking for tons of flavors i’m looking for a really solid flavor of whatever that pie is
11/28/19, 7:11 PM - Parker: plus whip cream on pie is more accepted and that’s a plus in my mind
11/28/19, 7:11 PM - Alex Starr: Right that can be good but not outstanding
11/28/19, 7:12 PM - Alex Starr: Not really.  Tons of Central European cakes are always served with whipped cream to cut richness
11/28/19, 7:16 PM - Alex Starr: I do agree that apple pie and berry pies can be really good
11/28/19, 7:16 PM - Matt Casali: Pumpkin has pumpkin nutmeg cinnamon and cloves right?
11/28/19, 7:16 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah
11/28/19, 7:16 PM - Matt Casali: That's 4 flavors
11/28/19, 7:16 PM - Alex Starr: Imo it’s cloying and too sweet
11/28/19, 7:16 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah its definitely really sweet
11/28/19, 7:16 PM - Matt Casali: But I have the same experience with a lot of cakes
11/28/19, 7:16 PM - Alex Starr: American cakes tend to be too sweet
11/28/19, 7:17 PM - Alex Starr: But European style cakes aren’t and there are some solid American cakes.  It’s just that American butter cream is nasty
11/28/19, 7:18 PM - Alex Starr: I think you guys need to be exposed to more cakes and entremet
11/28/19, 7:21 PM - Vaughn: I think alex is right we just havnt had enough good cake
11/28/19, 7:21 PM - Darren: Yes
11/28/19, 7:21 PM - Darren: Save us, alex
11/28/19, 7:22 PM - Vaughn: Great pies are way more achievable
11/28/19, 7:22 PM - Alex Starr: Well I’m making pumpkin pie for Friendsgiving
11/28/19, 7:22 PM - Alex Starr: But it won’t be very traditional so all good
11/28/19, 7:22 PM - Vaughn: Cant imagine some of the homemade pies i have being much better
11/28/19, 7:22 PM - Vaughn: But the cakes i have are usually pretty cheap
11/28/19, 7:22 PM - Alex Starr: I think they have a really low ceiling yeah
11/28/19, 7:24 PM - Tim Ko: Would u guys be unhappy if I actually brought chicken feet?
11/28/19, 7:24 PM - Alex Starr: No
11/28/19, 7:25 PM - Vaughn: I did not enjoy the chicken feet at dim sum
11/28/19, 7:25 PM - Vaughn: Would yours be better?
11/28/19, 7:26 PM - Alex Starr: We will honestly have so much food
11/28/19, 7:26 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
11/28/19, 7:26 PM - Tim Ko: Oh
11/28/19, 7:26 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah it’s be about the same
11/28/19, 7:26 PM - Tim Ko: What didn’t u like about it
11/28/19, 7:27 PM - Alex Starr: For me, it’s the chicken skin and fat aspect.
11/28/19, 7:27 PM - Vaughn: Same
11/28/19, 7:27 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah that’s what I like about it
11/28/19, 7:28 PM - Tim Ko: Aight I’ll bring something else then lol
11/28/19, 7:28 PM - Vaughn: And it takes so long to eat, every bite id have time to really think about what was in my mouth
11/28/19, 7:47 PM - Parker: Lol
11/28/19, 7:48 PM - Parker: I support this
11/28/19, 7:48 PM - Parker: Europe just does sweets better in general
11/28/19, 7:53 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah which is part of why I’m anti pie
11/28/19, 8:47 PM - Alex Starr: What’s the plan for Saturday?
11/29/19, 2:00 AM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
11/29/19, 8:34 AM - Vaughn: Lol
11/29/19, 8:44 AM - Parker: 😂
11/29/19, 9:40 AM - Parker: A smoke shop in eugene today has a black friday deal that’s buy any bong, and get the next one for $4.20 and there’s literally no limit on how much the bong can be lol
11/29/19, 9:40 AM - Parker: so my roommate Jake is buying a $180 bong and getting another one for me for $4.20😂
11/29/19, 9:41 AM - Parker: and we’re gonna split it but still you could get 2 $200 bongs for the price of one basically
11/29/19, 9:42 AM - Matt Casali: $100 dollars still sounds like a lot for a bong haha
11/29/19, 9:44 AM - Parker: It is but the difference between a $100 bong and $200 bong is huge
11/29/19, 9:44 AM - Parker: and i think he got one for less so i’m not spending that much but hypothetically you could buy as much as you want
11/29/19, 10:43 AM - Ricky: Yoooo that’s so sick!
11/29/19, 10:43 AM - Ricky: Sounds V worth
11/29/19, 12:48 PM - Collin Hurst: Who's tryna do something
11/29/19, 12:51 PM - Matt Casali: Maybe later? I gotta start on my dish for tomorrow though I think
11/29/19, 1:02 PM - Vaughn: Im free all day
11/29/19, 1:43 PM - Collin Hurst: Tf so early
11/29/19, 1:49 PM - Matt Casali: Well I'm making a crust for the quiche so I think I have to start that today so it can chill?
11/29/19, 1:49 PM - Matt Casali: Not sure though
11/29/19, 2:00 PM - Alex Starr: You pivoted from frittata?
11/29/19, 2:00 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah I just feel like a quiche is automatically better
11/29/19, 2:01 PM - Alex Starr: Debatable but fair.
11/29/19, 2:01 PM - Alex Starr: What’d you decide to toss in there?
11/29/19, 2:01 PM - Matt Casali: Not sure but I'm thinking of something like mushrooms and goat cheese
11/29/19, 2:01 PM - Matt Casali: It seemed like mushrooms were popular
11/29/19, 2:02 PM - Matt Casali: But also open to other options
11/29/19, 2:04 PM - Alex Starr: I’m down with leaving it your discretion
11/29/19, 2:10 PM - Vaughn: Anyone free right now?
11/29/19, 2:12 PM - Matt Casali: No, sorry :(
11/29/19, 2:13 PM - Collin Hurst: Fuck ur quiche
11/29/19, 2:13 PM - Matt Casali: Well that and I'm putting up Christmas stuff with my family soon
11/29/19, 2:13 PM - Matt Casali: But after?
11/29/19, 3:26 PM - Ricky: Yo Alex, we good for ur house? Also should I cook there?
11/29/19, 3:37 PM - Alex Starr: Entirely up to you and yes
11/29/19, 3:38 PM - Alex Starr: Or yes and entirely up to you
11/29/19, 3:38 PM - Collin Hurst: So what time should we gather if we are not getting there early to cook
11/29/19, 3:49 PM - Alex Starr: Dinner will be at 4:00, but you can probably get there 1:00 or after? Idk.

11/29/19, 4:00 PM - Collin Hurst: Yee

11/29/19, 4:59 PM - Matt Casali: Oh so we're not meeting them probably haha
11/29/19, 4:59 PM - Collin Hurst: So if we hung out we would be going out with them
11/29/19, 4:59 PM - Matt Casali: It's a lot later than when we're meeting
11/29/19, 5:00 PM - Ricky: But they are probably playing much less smash than we will
11/29/19, 5:02 PM - Matt Casali: That's true as well
11/29/19, 5:06 PM - Ricky: Haha so it may not happen, but either way we can go Han gun at Jasons for post Friendsgiving nonsense
11/29/19, 5:10 PM - Matt Casali: Ricky I assume you're not inviting grace?
11/29/19, 5:14 PM - Alex Starr: This or fotus is a good call

12/5/19, 9:25 PM - Ricky: His paragraph ones about random funny shot
12/5/19, 9:25 PM - Alex Starr: I think a good black card is “say one thing for Jason Greenberg say he’s a ______” for each person
12/5/19, 9:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh not bad
12/5/19, 9:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lol
12/5/19, 9:30 PM - Alex Starr: Family members too
12/5/19, 9:30 PM - Alex Starr: “Say one thing for Dave Hurst, say he’s a mason jar inserted into...”
12/5/19, 9:33 PM - Tim Ko: We all thought u we’re taking a 3 hour shower so u could be fresh for donz
12/5/19, 9:33 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah, really scrubbing those boys clean
12/5/19, 9:33 PM - Collin Hurst: Hey she has a boyfriend
12/5/19, 9:33 PM - Matt Casali: Ricky says otherwise👀
12/5/19, 9:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: We should really just do family members expansion pack
12/5/19, 9:34 PM - Alex Starr: You say it like it affects your decisions
12/5/19, 9:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: Whoa
12/5/19, 9:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: 👀👀👀
12/5/19, 9:34 PM - Alex Starr: I’m planning on doing a few
12/5/19, 9:34 PM - Collin Hurst: When I asked her she said they broke up but they were back together
12/5/19, 9:35 PM - Matt Casali: Oh, collin, dont even worry, that shits ending soon then
12/5/19, 9:35 PM - Collin Hurst: It never crossed my mind to worry
12/5/19, 9:36 PM - Alex Starr: Say one thing for Collin hurst, say he’s batting 1000 when she just broke up with her boyfriend.
12/5/19, 9:36 PM - Collin Hurst: I mean sure
12/5/19, 9:37 PM - Tim Ko: Hahaha
12/5/19, 9:37 PM - Collin Hurst: I think I've only ever been rejected once tbh
12/5/19, 9:37 PM - Tim Ko: Who is her boyfriend?
12/5/19, 9:37 PM - Collin Hurst: Some dude from ucsb
12/5/19, 9:37 PM - Tim Ko: Pic?
12/5/19, 9:37 PM - Tim Ko: By who?
12/5/19, 9:37 PM - Alex Starr: By recent break ups or in general
12/5/19, 9:37 PM - Matt Casali: WoW
12/5/19, 9:37 PM - Collin Hurst: Ryan Sturges
12/5/19, 9:38 PM - Collin Hurst: Hahaha
12/5/19, 9:38 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
12/5/19, 9:38 PM - Collin Hurst: Other than random tinder conversationa that doesn't count tho
12/5/19, 9:38 PM - Tim Ko: Did u ask her out
12/5/19, 9:38 PM - Matt Casali: Was that pre or post fiending
12/5/19, 9:38 PM - Matt Casali: It counts emotionally
12/5/19, 9:38 PM - Collin Hurst: what u mean
12/5/19, 9:38 PM - Alex Starr: Emotions weren’t a factor
12/5/19, 9:38 PM - Collin Hurst: Not really idc about tinder peeps until I see them irl
12/5/19, 9:39 PM - Matt Casali: Well I just remember you were fiending hard for Ryan sturges and then when Vaughn started, you stopped
12/5/19, 9:39 PM - Collin Hurst: No I stopped because I got rejected
12/5/19, 9:39 PM - Matt Casali: I see
12/5/19, 9:39 PM - Tim Ko: Did u ask her out on a date?
12/5/19, 9:39 PM - Collin Hurst: I asked for her number she said her parents took it away lmao
12/5/19, 9:40 PM - Collin Hurst: I knew it was bs
12/5/19, 9:40 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
12/5/19, 9:40 PM - Tim Ko: Like took her phone away?
12/5/19, 9:40 PM - Collin Hurst: Although idk before then she asked me if I wanted to come watch the track meet so that's why I went for it
12/5/19, 9:41 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah
12/5/19, 9:41 PM - Matt Casali: Too her number away
12/5/19, 9:41 PM - Matt Casali: *took
12/5/19, 9:41 PM - Tim Ko: U shoulda asked me collin
12/5/19, 9:41 PM - Tim Ko: I had her number
12/5/19, 9:41 PM - Tim Ko: 😂
12/5/19, 9:41 PM - Tim Ko: She even texted me once
12/5/19, 9:41 PM - Tim Ko: For some asb thing
12/5/19, 9:41 PM - Collin Hurst: Nah that's weird gotta have consent
12/5/19, 9:41 PM - Alex Starr: Thought this was heading a completely different direction
12/5/19, 9:42 PM - Tim Ko: Lmao
12/5/19, 9:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: Figures
12/5/19, 9:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: In senior year I ran a lot and so in all my genius I asked her to come on a run at a party and she said she was down
12/5/19, 9:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: But then one of her close friends said she was not a good prospect for me and I took it as a weird hint she wasn’t down
12/5/19, 9:46 PM - Tim Ko: U canceled it?
12/5/19, 9:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: I never followed through
12/5/19, 9:46 PM - Matt Casali: Honestly........ I don't get the Ryan sturges hype
12/5/19, 9:47 PM - Jason Greenberg: She cute
12/5/19, 9:47 PM - Collin Hurst: I remember when she ran after school around the soccer field and Eddie and I would just talk about how good looking she is
12/5/19, 9:47 PM - Matt Casali: Is she tho???
12/5/19, 9:47 PM - Collin Hurst: she replaced the other running girl that went to Princeton lol
12/5/19, 9:47 PM - Collin Hurst: yes
12/5/19, 9:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: Melissa Reed?
12/5/19, 9:48 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah^!!!
12/5/19, 9:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: My mom is best friends with her mom
12/5/19, 9:48 PM - Collin Hurst: I had a fatass crush on her for a while when she was in pottery haha
12/5/19, 9:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah she’s a stallion for sure
12/5/19, 9:49 PM - Matt Casali: I just looked at her insta and I could see it, but definitely there were way more attractive people at mv
12/5/19, 9:49 PM - Collin Hurst: it was me, Melissa, Chandler Brown, and Matt Mccarthy
12/5/19, 9:49 PM - Collin Hurst: at the table in ceramics it was lit
12/5/19, 9:49 PM - Collin Hurst: like Lianne Frick
12/5/19, 9:50 PM - Collin Hurst: I just talked about this with Darren
12/5/19, 9:54 PM - Matt Casali: Yes! She's even better looking now I think
12/5/19, 9:54 PM - Matt Casali: But lunch with her was kinda boring :/
12/5/19, 9:54 PM - Matt Casali: But at the same time I wish I was still connected cause she's in a cool lab at berkeley haha
12/5/19, 9:55 PM - Collin Hurst: aw why
12/5/19, 9:55 PM - Collin Hurst: when did you get lunch? haha
12/5/19, 9:55 PM - Collin Hurst: I remeber I thought she was cute and I had a free 4th the same time she did but then Donya and I started hanging
12/5/19, 9:56 PM - Collin Hurst: and you also had dibs
12/5/19, 9:57 PM - Alex Starr: Isn’t she psychology?
12/5/19, 9:59 PM - Matt Casali: Ohhh wait yeah, okay I dont know what I was thinking haha
12/5/19, 9:59 PM - Matt Casali: Haha I was just determined to ask her out
12/5/19, 9:59 PM - Matt Casali: Idk it was just kind of awkward I think
12/5/19, 10:00 PM - Matt Casali: How do you want these cards jason?
12/5/19, 10:02 PM - Alex Starr: Hand delivered by you in full black face
12/5/19, 10:03 PM - Matt Casali: Hahaha the only possible away
12/5/19, 10:03 PM - Matt Casali: I assume brown face is also acceptable?
12/5/19, 10:05 PM - Collin Hurst: secret santa this christmas?
12/5/19, 10:05 PM - Alex Starr: Black or red only
12/5/19, 10:05 PM - Alex Starr: Would it help if I said no?
12/5/19, 10:06 PM - Collin Hurst: no, we are doing it regardless
12/5/19, 10:06 PM - Collin Hurst: yooooo we should do a white elephant party
12/5/19, 10:06 PM - Matt Casali: I'm down for both haha
12/5/19, 10:07 PM - Matt Casali: I'm much better on specific presents than general presents
12/5/19, 10:07 PM - Collin Hurst: after christmas, so you can give away the presents that you didn't like
12/5/19, 10:07 PM - Matt Casali: Perfect
12/5/19, 10:07 PM - Collin Hurst: let's invite Lianne Frick
12/5/19, 10:08 PM - Matt Casali: I didnt think it could be any more perfect
12/5/19, 10:08 PM - Alex Starr: Can we pick one?
12/5/19, 10:08 PM - Alex Starr: Secret Santa xor white elephant?
12/5/19, 10:08 PM - Collin Hurst: why not both
12/5/19, 10:09 PM - Collin Hurst: white elephant id for shittier things that you don't need
12/5/19, 10:09 PM - Tim Ko: We could bring lianne to Mexico so we can buy her and then gift her to Matt
12/5/19, 10:09 PM - Collin Hurst: is* at least that's how I've done it
12/5/19, 10:09 PM - Collin Hurst: oh my god
12/5/19, 10:09 PM - Collin Hurst: haha
12/5/19, 10:09 PM - Alex Starr: Lol
12/5/19, 10:09 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah I think it’d be more fun
12/5/19, 10:09 PM - Collin Hurst: then maybe matt will come
12/5/19, 10:10 PM - Alex Starr: You know what
12/5/19, 10:10 PM - Alex Starr: I’m not gonna touch thatIf
12/5/19, 10:10 PM - Alex Starr: That*
12/5/19, 10:11 PM - Collin Hurst: Lol
12/5/19, 10:11 PM - Collin Hurst: I gave it to you
12/5/19, 10:11 PM - Collin Hurst: You have grown stronger than I thought
12/5/19, 11:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: Send in a list with new lines
12/5/19, 11:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: If you wanna format to the card generator you can as well
12/5/19, 11:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: But no need
12/6/19, 12:28 AM - Parker: hahaha the whole lacrosse team did the same thing
12/6/19, 12:28 AM - Parker: tommy walters would fiend hard
12/6/19, 12:28 AM - Parker: and we were obsessed with melissa
12/6/19, 12:29 AM - Parker: hundo p
12/6/19, 7:44 AM - Darren: What the fuck guys
12/6/19, 7:45 AM - Darren: Melissa reed >> average >> Ryan
12/6/19, 7:46 AM - Darren: That's overly harsh, but it gets my point across of Melissa being substantially above ryan
12/6/19, 7:50 AM - Alex Starr: That is harsh
12/6/19, 7:50 AM - Alex Starr: But the sentiment is not wrong
12/6/19, 7:51 AM - Darren: Yeah average was not the right word
12/6/19, 8:06 AM - Parker: that is correct
12/6/19, 8:09 AM - Alex Starr: Damn
12/6/19, 8:09 AM - Alex Starr: Very polarized opinions
12/6/19, 10:20 AM - Matt Casali: Who wants to go to del taco over break??
12/6/19, 10:26 AM - Alex Starr: What the good fuck
12/6/19, 10:29 AM - Matt Casali: I heard they have a beyond meat cali burrito and my curiosity has gotten the better of me
12/6/19, 10:34 AM - Parker: Sounds like the good part of a day on the toilet but i’m down
12/6/19, 10:35 AM - Matt Casali: A day well spent
12/6/19, 10:38 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah apparently your curiosity is a laxative Matt
12/6/19, 10:46 AM - Jason Greenberg: On a related note, I tried impossible meat at the counter and it is light years ahead of beyond meat
12/6/19, 10:49 AM - Parker: I’ve never had beyond but i liked the impossible
12/6/19, 10:49 AM - Parker: We had it at the melt
12/6/19, 10:53 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah beyond kinda is bad haha, BUT I still wanna have the cali burrito at del taco
12/6/19, 10:55 AM - Alex Starr: I think you mostly want a Cali burrito for reasons that remain unclear to me
12/6/19, 10:56 AM - Darren: Cali burritos are sick
12/6/19, 10:57 AM - Matt Casali: ^
12/6/19, 10:59 AM - Matt Casali: As long as I've lived at home my preference for crunchiness inside a soft wrap (fries in a burrito, crushed chips in a quessadilla) has been made fun of and being so deprived has made me fiend for cali burritos now at every turn
12/6/19, 11:00 AM - Matt Casali: We should all find a smash tournament in the bay area and sign up
12/6/19, 11:00 AM - Darren: That's a lame ass backstory
12/6/19, 11:00 AM - Matt Casali: During break
12/6/19, 11:00 AM - Matt Casali: It's for a burrito
12/6/19, 11:00 AM - Alex Starr: Is that how you got those scars?
12/6/19, 11:00 AM - Darren: You could pay +$100 to go to Genesis9
12/6/19, 11:01 AM - Matt Casali: That sounds bad
12/6/19, 11:01 AM - Matt Casali: But I would be down for a smaller one
12/6/19, 11:01 AM - Matt Casali: Is kiki going?
12/6/19, 11:01 AM - Alex Starr: I’m not super interested in attending a smash tournament
12/6/19, 11:02 AM - Darren: Yep
12/6/19, 11:03 AM - Matt Casali: I just think it would be fun
12/6/19, 11:03 AM - Matt Casali: I doubt any of us will get far at all
12/6/19, 11:04 AM - Matt Casali: But itd be fun to like cheer each other on in the early rounds and like hang out somewhere together
12/6/19, 11:04 AM - Alex Starr: I’d rather hang out elsewhere
12/6/19, 11:06 AM - Matt Casali: Okay, yeah, after thinking about it like a second more i realize that we'll probably just get destroyed pretty quickly
12/6/19, 11:06 AM - Matt Casali: We should have a smash tournament just us then
12/6/19, 11:06 AM - Matt Casali: I can organize it if people are down
12/6/19, 11:06 AM - Alex Starr: That I could get behind
12/6/19, 11:07 AM - Alex Starr: Especially if it wasn’t smash 5
12/6/19, 11:07 AM - Matt Casali: Nah it would be ultimate haha
12/6/19, 11:07 AM - Alex Starr: Meh
12/6/19, 11:07 AM - Matt Casali: Or we could have two
12/6/19, 11:07 AM - Alex Starr: It’d still be fun.  Just I personally have played about 5 hours total haha
12/6/19, 11:08 AM - Matt Casali: One smash 4, one smash 5
12/6/19, 11:09 AM - Tim Ko: We should do herd survivor again 😂
12/6/19, 11:09 AM - Tim Ko: I still remember that
12/6/19, 11:10 AM - Matt Casali: I'd be down
12/6/19, 11:38 AM - Jason Greenberg: Yes
12/6/19, 11:39 AM - Matt Casali: I'm also down to organize that haha
12/6/19, 12:15 PM - Tim Ko: Yay!
12/6/19, 12:15 PM - Tim Ko: Think we did it at the Bubb playgrounds last time
12/6/19, 12:16 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t think there’s an easy way to make it so that everyone is invested
12/6/19, 12:17 PM - Alex Starr: Unless the winner got to pick the destination
12/6/19, 12:17 PM - Tim Ko: Money
12/6/19, 12:18 PM - Alex Starr: Have to be too much money
12/6/19, 12:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: Better to motivate with consequences for losing
12/6/19, 12:25 PM - Matt Casali: Yes
12/6/19, 12:27 PM - Parker: ^^
12/6/19, 12:27 PM - Parker: and i’ll actually somewhat know what i’m doing this time lol
12/6/19, 12:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: Loser has to make a LinkedIn post
12/6/19, 12:27 PM - Parker: I’d happily lose
12/6/19, 12:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Damn that one would probably destroy me
12/6/19, 12:28 PM - Alex Starr: Except no one actually follows through
12/6/19, 12:29 PM - Parker: I would with that one lol
12/6/19, 12:29 PM - Parker: And given that i’ll most likely lose, i promise i will
12/6/19, 12:30 PM - Alex Starr: See Tim’s pushups, r/roastme etc.
12/6/19, 12:30 PM - Alex Starr: Also negative consequences for a game with one winner where the first loser is decided by a vote doesn’t make a ton of sense
12/6/19, 12:31 PM - Matt Casali: I think we would have to make intersecting negative consequences for multiple people
12/6/19, 12:32 PM - Matt Casali: Maybe play in pairs?
12/6/19, 12:32 PM - Alex Starr: Why would I want to play something where at best I’m not punished?
12/6/19, 12:32 PM - Matt Casali: Because otherwise we have to pay too much money
12/6/19, 12:32 PM - Matt Casali: And the experience of playing is fun
12/6/19, 12:33 PM - Alex Starr: Eh it didn’t work out great last time
12/6/19, 12:33 PM - Matt Casali: I had fun
12/6/19, 12:33 PM - Matt Casali: Tim apparently did
12/6/19, 12:33 PM - Matt Casali: We got a funny story from it
12/6/19, 12:33 PM - Alex Starr: Like it wasn’t bad, but I didn’t walk out saying let’s do that again?
12/6/19, 12:33 PM - Alex Starr: We did?
12/6/19, 12:34 PM - Matt Casali: Just that everyone was so salty towards Vaughn that we voted for darren out of spite and the promise of pizza
12/6/19, 12:34 PM - Alex Starr: We have never told that story haha
12/6/19, 12:34 PM - Matt Casali: Vaughn and darren bring it up
12/6/19, 12:34 PM - Matt Casali: Multiple times
12/6/19, 12:34 PM - Alex Starr: Fair enough
12/6/19, 12:35 PM - Collin Hurst: I'd rather do amazing race
12/6/19, 12:35 PM - Matt Casali: Anyways, this much deliberation over _how_ fun a game will be is stupid and we should just play the game
12/6/19, 12:35 PM - Collin Hurst: The game will be stupid imo
12/6/19, 12:35 PM - Matt Casali: Experience it and then move on with our lives
12/6/19, 12:35 PM - Alex Starr: Or just not play cuz we are deliberating
12/6/19, 12:35 PM - Alex Starr: We did.
12/6/19, 12:36 PM - Collin Hurst: There's too much relationship already built it's not the same game
12/6/19, 12:36 PM - Matt Casali: Okay okay okay
12/6/19, 12:36 PM - Collin Hurst: Amazing race sounds good
12/6/19, 12:36 PM - Matt Casali: A couple people said they were interested
12/6/19, 12:36 PM - Matt Casali: I just thought I'd push for that
12/6/19, 12:36 PM - Alex Starr: Sounds like a lot of strange driving around Collin
12/6/19, 12:36 PM - Matt Casali: But such a struggle, jeez
12/6/19, 12:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ohhh
12/6/19, 12:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: That sounds dope af
12/6/19, 12:37 PM - Matt Casali: This is why we just play smash haha
12/6/19, 12:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah I guess the probably with survivor is we already know everything about everyone
12/6/19, 12:38 PM - Matt Casali: They have seasons of survivor with repeat players who have played against each other before
12/6/19, 12:38 PM - Matt Casali: Works out fine then
12/6/19, 12:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: We did a mini version of this for my birthday party in fifth grade and it was super fun
12/6/19, 12:38 PM - Matt Casali: In fact I feel like it builds the meta
12/6/19, 12:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: IMO
12/6/19, 12:38 PM - Collin Hurst: Nah there's a lot of things we could do for transportation
12/6/19, 12:38 PM - Collin Hurst: Like make people walk, take the bus, train, etc
12/6/19, 12:38 PM - Collin Hurst: Or even bike
12/6/19, 12:39 PM - Matt Casali: ^ I would like to emphasize this
12/6/19, 12:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: That would be good television
12/6/19, 12:39 PM - Matt Casali: Add to the convoluted discourse that is us just trying to suggest things to do during break haha
12/6/19, 12:41 PM - Alex Starr: Poker, go to Santa Cruz, go to SF, the zoo, all you can eat sushi, CAH, party at Jason’s
12/6/19, 12:41 PM - Vaughn: Down for amazing race
12/6/19, 12:41 PM - Collin Hurst: But there is so much more than just the game involved when we are playing
12/6/19, 12:41 PM - Alex Starr: We don’t need convoluted other things to hand out
12/6/19, 12:41 PM - Alex Starr: In fact my decision would be 0% based on the game
12/6/19, 12:41 PM - Vaughn: Each person could design a leg of the race with challenges and such
12/6/19, 12:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: True and also it would be fun
12/6/19, 12:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: Would we have one team get a bye on their leg?
12/6/19, 12:42 PM - Alex Starr: Imo, doing a big planned thing decreases hang out time
12/6/19, 12:43 PM - Vaughn: Im also very down for those herd challenges that alex recorded every week
12/6/19, 12:43 PM - Matt Casali: I feel like my ideas specifically are being met with an immediate wall
12/6/19, 12:43 PM - Vaughn: Have a nice point system
12/6/19, 12:43 PM - Matt Casali: Not that we cant decide on anything
12/6/19, 12:43 PM - Matt Casali: I dont care what we do
12/6/19, 12:43 PM - Matt Casali: I just feel like I cant suggest anything
12/6/19, 12:44 PM - Alex Starr: You can.
12/6/19, 12:44 PM - Alex Starr: What would you say if I said let’s watch a Starcraft final?
12/6/19, 12:44 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz that to you is survivor to me
12/6/19, 12:44 PM - Collin Hurst: ^
12/6/19, 12:45 PM - Alex Starr: And my shit talking of del taco was not intended as a no.

12/6/19, 12:45 PM - Collin Hurst: I'm down to get back into StarCraft
12/6/19, 12:45 PM - Alex Starr: It was entirely intended as shit talking of del taco
12/6/19, 12:45 PM - Matt Casali: We're all good
12/6/19, 12:45 PM - Tim Ko: All u can eat sushi is a must do
12/6/19, 12:45 PM - Tim Ko: Just saying
12/6/19, 12:45 PM - Vaughn: Fosho
12/6/19, 12:45 PM - Collin Hurst: I'm down for more poker
12/6/19, 12:45 PM - Alex Starr: Definitely
12/6/19, 12:45 PM - Alex Starr: Poker is fun
12/6/19, 12:45 PM - Collin Hurst: It trains me to hide my saltiness
12/6/19, 12:45 PM - Vaughn: Lets beat our record
12/6/19, 12:45 PM - Alex Starr: For sushi or poker?
12/6/19, 12:46 PM - Collin Hurst: Idk what that means for poker
12/6/19, 12:46 PM - Collin Hurst: I assume sushi
12/6/19, 12:46 PM - Alex Starr: And Matt I think close to everyone was onboard with in house smash tourney
12/6/19, 12:46 PM - Collin Hurst: I miss the bball days
12/6/19, 12:46 PM - Matt Casali: Nah I'm projecting other problems
12/6/19, 12:46 PM - Matt Casali: We're all good
12/6/19, 12:47 PM - Tim Ko: ^!!!
12/6/19, 12:47 PM - Collin Hurst: Parker Tim let's head to Google this break
12/6/19, 12:47 PM - Tim Ko: This was fun
12/6/19, 12:47 PM - Tim Ko: Yeee
12/6/19, 12:47 PM - Vaughn: Anyone wanna try dnd?
12/6/19, 12:47 PM - Matt Casali: I'll just stay home haha
12/6/19, 12:47 PM - Matt Casali: YES
12/6/19, 12:47 PM - Tim Ko: What’s dnd
12/6/19, 12:47 PM - Alex Starr: It was definitely what could appear as a wall of negativity from me at least
12/6/19, 12:47 PM - Collin Hurst: I'm already watching naruto, I think I got my weeb limit
12/6/19, 12:47 PM - Vaughn: Or maybe some complicated competitive boardgame that noones played?
12/6/19, 12:47 PM - Alex Starr: Tabletop Minecraft
12/6/19, 12:47 PM - Alex Starr: I have some
12/6/19, 12:48 PM - Matt Casali: No it's okay, what you were saying is valid and would probably make it hard for it to be like worth the effort
12/6/19, 12:48 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah cuz my memory of survivor is also you being somewhat sad that we weren’t taking it seriously
12/6/19, 12:48 PM - Tim Ko: ^this is true
12/6/19, 12:49 PM - Collin Hurst: The best activity would be if we just started a company
12/6/19, 12:49 PM - Alex Starr: And so ends productive brainstorming
12/6/19, 12:49 PM - Matt Casali: I think this is a common theme in what I've organized for the herd and in terms of the games I've tried to make in general
12/6/19, 12:50 PM - Matt Casali: I take it very seriously
12/6/19, 12:50 PM - Matt Casali: And I'm not sure how to stoke the same feelings in other people
12/6/19, 12:50 PM - Tim Ko: ^!!!
12/6/19, 12:50 PM - Matt Casali: I would never enter into a company with y'all sorry haha
12/6/19, 12:50 PM - Collin Hurst: Naturally not everyone will be into it and are just there to hang out with each other
12/6/19, 12:50 PM - Tim Ko: Herd Tech
12/6/19, 12:51 PM - Tim Ko: Herd Med and Tech
12/6/19, 12:51 PM - Collin Hurst: You were never invited
12/6/19, 12:51 PM - Matt Casali: Doesn't mean I dont still wish they were into it
12/6/19, 12:51 PM - Matt Casali: Noice
12/6/19, 12:52 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah, it's hard to make people like things
12/6/19, 12:52 PM - Tim Ko: Alex if u ever discover a new protein or gene, can u pls name it herd?
12/6/19, 12:52 PM - Collin Hurst: I was kidding matt ur always welcome to join a company we start
12/6/19, 12:52 PM - Collin Hurst: As janitor
12/6/19, 12:52 PM - Alex Starr: Herd is top 5 on my list of things I absolutely will not name it
12/6/19, 12:53 PM - Matt Casali: Where my skills would be most appreciated
12/6/19, 12:53 PM - Alex Starr: I’d be willing to name it something group related, but absolutely not herd related
12/6/19, 12:53 PM - Collin Hurst: Is herd over or under Sarafina
12/6/19, 12:53 PM - Alex Starr: Just under
12/6/19, 12:53 PM - Collin Hurst: I'll keep that in mind
12/6/19, 12:53 PM - Vaughn: Alex is not over sarafina
12/6/19, 12:53 PM - Vaughn: Thats for sure
12/6/19, 12:53 PM - Alex Starr: With over and under there just was no winning
12/6/19, 12:54 PM - Tim Ko: Hahaha
12/6/19, 12:54 PM - Tim Ko: Alex she’s one knock on the door away
12/6/19, 12:54 PM - Vaughn: Herd olympics
12/6/19, 12:54 PM - Tim Ko: She even lives in our building!
12/6/19, 12:54 PM - Alex Starr: Or just a trip to SF
12/6/19, 12:55 PM - Collin Hurst: Or maybe someplace further away
12/6/19, 12:55 PM - Alex Starr: Like paristerdam
12/6/19, 12:55 PM - Collin Hurst: Like across part of an ocean
12/6/19, 12:55 PM - Collin Hurst: Tropical
12/6/19, 12:55 PM - Tim Ko: Bike to sf!
12/6/19, 12:55 PM - Alex Starr: Or a whole motherfucking ocean
12/6/19, 12:55 PM - Vaughn: But not like all supet competitve physical games cause id win em all. Some abstract ones like the office olympics
12/6/19, 12:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’d do it if I could be a salaried therapist
12/6/19, 12:58 PM - Alex Starr: I think it’d be really hard to come up with challenges without really clear cut favorites
12/6/19, 12:59 PM - Alex Starr: For me maybe in 10 years
12/6/19, 1:03 PM - Matt Casali: We'd need it
12/6/19, 1:04 PM - Collin Hurst: Most realistic company people would be Me, Darren, Vaughn, Parker,Ricky I think we would work great
12/6/19, 1:06 PM - Alex Starr: Bitch
12/6/19, 1:06 PM - Tim Ko: If u guys can develop an improved electronic health record system, that would make alottttt of money
12/6/19, 1:06 PM - Collin Hurst: I actually meant to include u haha
12/6/19, 1:06 PM - Alex Starr: Really hard to get adopters
12/6/19, 1:06 PM - Collin Hurst: My b alex
12/6/19, 1:07 PM - Tim Ko: Yes but if u did....
12/6/19, 1:07 PM - Tim Ko: Just saying
12/6/19, 1:07 PM - Collin Hurst: I got some connections to Rally who are owned by United Health
12/6/19, 1:07 PM - Vaughn: Jason too
12/6/19, 1:07 PM - Collin Hurst: We're in
12/6/19, 1:07 PM - Tim Ko: Something I could potentially help in :)
12/6/19, 1:07 PM - Vaughn: and tim
12/6/19, 1:07 PM - Vaughn: And matt
12/6/19, 1:07 PM - Tim Ko: Or another one is telemedicine
12/6/19, 1:08 PM - Tim Ko: New field, very flawed, but has potential
12/6/19, 1:08 PM - Alex Starr: Let’s not go nuts
12/6/19, 1:08 PM - Alex Starr: Also I called that this would be the death knell for useful discussion
12/6/19, 1:09 PM - Alex Starr: Collin would you really give up 6 figures for some random company started by us?
12/6/19, 1:11 PM - Tim Ko: ^
12/6/19, 1:15 PM - Collin Hurst: Nah I'd work on it on the side
12/6/19, 1:15 PM - Collin Hurst: At least if we started it this year
12/6/19, 1:16 PM - Parker: yes!! i meant to say to you guys i’m trying to hoop a bunch this break
12/6/19, 1:16 PM - Parker: Easily
12/6/19, 1:17 PM - Parker: Hahaha
12/6/19, 2:04 PM - Alex Starr: The fuck?
12/6/19, 2:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: It's okay Alex we can start a rival company called Herd 2.0 that builds computational model of brains that can talk about their childhood
12/6/19, 2:15 PM - Parker: and you dummy
12/6/19, 3:55 PM - Alex Starr: This I could get behind
12/6/19, 3:56 PM - Darren: Herd 2.0 is a good way to get sued for copyright and brand issues
12/6/19, 4:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: Pretty sure adding a 2.0 to anything means it’s fair game
12/6/19, 4:02 PM - Jason Greenberg: I worked at a trademarking company for six months
12/6/19, 4:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: Any time a 2.0-related application would come in it was great because we would immediately forward them to the USPTO
12/6/19, 4:52 PM - Matt Casali: You're invited to a gift exchange! Herd Exchange. https://www.elfster.com/gift-exchanges/04be0734-336d-44ba-9c5e-ce545f12af4f/?join=mdri

12/9/19, 10:49 AM - Tim Ko: How bout the 5th?
12/9/19, 10:53 AM - Matt Casali: I mean I thought we had kinda decided on that for new years?
12/9/19, 10:54 AM - Parker: we did?
12/9/19, 10:54 AM - Matt Casali: Maybe not haha
12/9/19, 10:54 AM - Matt Casali: But I know it was suggested
12/9/19, 10:54 AM - Matt Casali: So.. I guess.. would you guys wanna do an sc housecrawl for new years?? Invite some mv peeps
12/9/19, 10:54 AM - Darren: We did not
12/9/19, 10:56 AM - Ricky: WAIT
12/9/19, 10:56 AM - Ricky: I have another option
12/9/19, 10:56 AM - Collin Hurst: Nah
12/9/19, 10:56 AM - Ricky: Up to y’all but grace is throwing a new years party in SF at her dads studio
12/9/19, 10:56 AM - Collin Hurst: We decided that new year's is a more people thing and we didn't think we could get hella people to come to sc
12/9/19, 10:56 AM - Collin Hurst: Calm
12/9/19, 10:57 AM - Ricky: ?
12/9/19, 10:57 AM - Collin Hurst: ?
12/9/19, 10:58 AM - Parker: stfu
12/9/19, 10:58 AM - Parker: that’s what i remember
12/9/19, 10:58 AM - Matt Casali: Okeydoke
12/9/19, 10:58 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah I'm down for sf!
12/9/19, 10:58 AM - Parker: OR we send it to LA and then we all go to the rose bowl on the 1st
12/9/19, 10:59 AM - Collin Hurst: That's calm
12/9/19, 10:59 AM - Collin Hurst: Interesting move
12/9/19, 11:07 AM - Darren: Collin you're the actual worst
12/9/19, 11:13 AM - Vaughn: Collin is deadass not gas
12/9/19, 11:23 AM - Darren: No cap
12/9/19, 11:24 AM - Ricky: Guys, E-40 used no cap.
I have to admit it is a real thing now
12/9/19, 11:30 AM - Collin Hurst: Boom
12/9/19, 11:36 AM - Alex Starr: I regret the 13 seconds I spent reading this
12/9/19, 11:37 AM - Tim Ko: What if instead of going to a party we all played Minecraft
12/9/19, 11:39 AM - Collin Hurst: Then we would be lame-os
12/9/19, 11:48 AM - Jason Greenberg: How many people kind of party?
12/9/19, 11:50 AM - Parker: So has like every other rapper haha
12/9/19, 11:50 AM - Alex Starr: Understatement of the year
12/9/19, 12:29 PM - Ricky: Like party party
12/9/19, 12:30 PM - Ricky: Idk 100% of details
12/9/19, 12:30 PM - Ricky: Prob 40+
12/9/19, 12:30 PM - Ricky: But 18 of that is already is and fotus
12/9/19, 12:46 PM - Parker: i’m kinda down tbh
12/9/19, 12:46 PM - Parker: are they going out after?
12/9/19, 1:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: Do we have to rent a airbnb?
12/9/19, 1:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: /where we sleeping?
12/9/19, 1:57 PM - Collin Hurst: ^^ that could be the move
12/9/19, 1:58 PM - Collin Hurst: expensive doe probs
12/9/19, 1:58 PM - Collin Hurst: although splitting ubers back home could be ok too in comparison
12/9/19, 2:08 PM - Ricky: Pple can sleep there I’m p sure, usually pple bring air mattresses and stuff
12/9/19, 2:20 PM - Alex Starr: I’m leaving the 1st I think
12/9/19, 2:20 PM - Alex Starr: So would Uber back
12/9/19, 5:03 PM - Collin Hurst: Some of the TAs at the school are taking part in a wildcat strike where they are withholding grades for the class in order to protest low wages
12/9/19, 5:03 PM - Collin Hurst: Some peeps I know may get an incomplete if the situation isn't resolved
12/9/19, 5:05 PM - Alex Starr: If any of them are failing I bet they are stoked
12/9/19, 5:08 PM - Darren: The TAs are still grading finals etc but are withholding them in the short term. The proper grades return as soon as a decision is made between the grad student (union?) and UCSC
12/9/19, 5:09 PM - Alex Starr: Grad students are underpaid
12/9/19, 5:12 PM - Collin Hurst: nah it's a wildcat strike
12/9/19, 5:13 PM - Collin Hurst: so the union is not associated
12/9/19, 5:13 PM - Darren: Ah, that's what wildcat means
12/9/19, 5:14 PM - Matt Casali: ^
12/9/19, 5:14 PM - Collin Hurst: it is a lot to ask for out of the blue tho
12/9/19, 5:14 PM - Matt Casali: It's not out of the blue haha
12/9/19, 5:14 PM - Collin Hurst: not that I have done much research
12/9/19, 5:14 PM - Collin Hurst: is it not? I heard that there hasn't been any major bringing up of it recently
12/9/19, 5:15 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah, they've been protesting their wages for at least this whole quarter and some of last year if I'm not mistaken
12/9/19, 5:15 PM - Collin Hurst: oh ok
12/9/19, 5:15 PM - Matt Casali: I think it's just a much wider audience now haha
12/9/19, 5:15 PM - Matt Casali: So everyone's talking about it
12/9/19, 5:16 PM - Collin Hurst: so where would the money come from?
12/9/19, 5:16 PM - Alex Starr: The massive value they add to the economy
12/9/19, 5:16 PM - Matt Casali: From all of the money that ucsc has
12/9/19, 5:16 PM - Matt Casali: And that too haha
12/9/19, 5:16 PM - Darren: They are asking for $1400 extra per month
12/9/19, 5:16 PM - Alex Starr: Unless they aren’t stem
12/9/19, 5:16 PM - Darren: Which is so goddamn much
12/9/19, 5:16 PM - Alex Starr: In which case they are fine
12/9/19, 5:16 PM - Collin Hurst: i don't really have an understanding of UCSC's budgeting so idk
12/9/19, 5:17 PM - Matt Casali: Admittedly neither do I, my sources are just from the strikes that have been happening
12/9/19, 5:17 PM - Collin Hurst: the only arguments I've heard are singling out single people that are overpaid like the chancellor or whatever, but thats not a lot of money
12/9/19, 5:17 PM - Matt Casali: I mean it's a good amount
12/9/19, 5:18 PM - Matt Casali: But faculty chairs are also overpaid
12/9/19, 5:18 PM - Ricky: But prob not crazy compared to 1400 per TA haha
12/9/19, 5:18 PM - Alex Starr: I wouldn’t go nuts
12/9/19, 5:18 PM - Collin Hurst: ^per month
12/9/19, 5:18 PM - Darren: 1400 extra per TA per month. They already get 2000ish
12/9/19, 5:18 PM - Alex Starr: For TAing or as their entire stipend?
12/9/19, 5:19 PM - Collin Hurst: Subhas should get paid 15$ for his booty curriculum so I agree with some of that
12/9/19, 5:19 PM - Matt Casali: It doesn't seem to me like 2000/month is fair for the job they're doing?
12/9/19, 5:19 PM - Darren: For TAing. They also cover tuition
12/9/19, 5:19 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t think fair factors into it.
12/9/19, 5:19 PM - Matt Casali: Wat
12/9/19, 5:20 PM - Darren: IIRC a TA is only contractually obligated to work 20 hours per week
12/9/19, 5:20 PM - Alex Starr: Right but are they living off 24K per year or do they have other sources of income?
12/9/19, 5:20 PM - Matt Casali: I wonder if that's the average
12/9/19, 5:20 PM - Alex Starr: No I’m pretty sure it’s a strict upper limit
12/9/19, 5:20 PM - Alex Starr: At least at cal
12/9/19, 5:20 PM - Darren: Leland was told to stop working by his professor when he reached 20
12/9/19, 5:20 PM - Collin Hurst: is this for all TA's in a class period?
12/9/19, 5:21 PM - Alex Starr: So do they get money in addition to 2K per month? Cuz that’s barely livable
12/9/19, 5:21 PM - Collin Hurst: if so then some are underpaid, some are overpaid lol
12/9/19, 5:21 PM - Matt Casali: That's what they're asking for
12/9/19, 5:22 PM - Matt Casali: 2k is the standard at other UC's apparently, but they're saying that the cost of living in sc is higher so they're wages should reflect that
12/9/19, 5:22 PM - Matt Casali: Also, international TAs cant hold any other jobs
12/9/19, 5:22 PM - Matt Casali: So they're kinda fucked
12/9/19, 5:24 PM - Ricky: Damn, their TA jobs can’t pay for the insurance on their Lamborghini’s
12/9/19, 5:25 PM - Matt Casali: Hahaha
12/9/19, 5:25 PM - Alex Starr: In my experience you get paid extra for TAing, though that could be the programs I’m applying to
12/9/19, 5:25 PM - Alex Starr: Lol international phds =\= international undergrads
12/9/19, 5:26 PM - Ricky: Do they get housing and food with it?
12/9/19, 5:26 PM - Matt Casali: Not food
12/9/19, 5:26 PM - Matt Casali: Dont know about housing
12/9/19, 5:26 PM - Matt Casali: I dont think so?
12/9/19, 5:26 PM - Alex Starr: They usually don’t
12/9/19, 5:26 PM - Alex Starr: Sometimes they get a stipend especially around here cuz housing is so expensive
12/9/19, 5:26 PM - Ricky: Oh shoot, that does suck ass
12/9/19, 5:27 PM - Matt Casali: I think the 2k is for being an actual TA, I'm not sure PhD or masters students are getting paid for their research
12/9/19, 5:27 PM - Alex Starr: They do in stem
12/9/19, 5:27 PM - Alex Starr: Not in humanities
12/9/19, 5:28 PM - Alex Starr: And bio phds often don’t even have to TA
12/9/19, 5:28 PM - Matt Casali: I guess theres more grant money in stem so that makes sense
12/9/19, 5:28 PM - Alex Starr: Yup
12/9/19, 5:28 PM - Alex Starr: And even more in bio so that makes sense too
12/9/19, 5:29 PM - Darren: Only some of the labs on campus have enough funding for their PhD candidates
12/9/19, 5:29 PM - Alex Starr: You frequently have to secure other funding
12/9/19, 5:29 PM - Alex Starr: Someone I know will be admitted to MIT contingent on securing funding for one year
12/9/19, 5:30 PM - Alex Starr: That’s why getting a fellowship is a huge deal.  Professors are usually upfront about whether they have money for you tho
12/9/19, 5:31 PM - Matt Casali: Ew i hate that
12/9/19, 5:31 PM - Alex Starr: It makes sense.  The lab can’t pay her, so she needs to get funding
12/9/19, 5:31 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah, just sad
12/9/19, 5:32 PM - Alex Starr: Eh she has/will have lots of other offers but I agree
12/9/19, 5:33 PM - Alex Starr: So is it stem people protesting or other? Just curious
12/9/19, 5:33 PM - Matt Casali: All I think
12/9/19, 5:34 PM - Matt Casali: My first final today had TAs from sustainability dept and EE dept and they both said they were participating
12/9/19, 5:35 PM - Alex Starr: Damn
12/9/19, 5:35 PM - Alex Starr: Glad most of my programs won’t make me TA more than two quarters/semesters
12/9/19, 5:36 PM - Alex Starr: And after that I’d get paid extra
12/9/19, 5:36 PM - Matt Casali: Noice
12/9/19, 5:37 PM - Matt Casali: I feel TAing would be cool at least for a little bit
12/9/19, 5:37 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah private grad school in bio >>>
12/9/19, 5:37 PM - Matt Casali: Or good experience
12/9/19, 5:38 PM - Alex Starr: Schools don’t care much about your teaching ability
12/9/19, 5:39 PM - Darren: Our professors and lecturers are evidence of this
12/9/19, 5:39 PM - Matt Casali: Yes
12/9/19, 5:39 PM - Alex Starr: They care about lecturers (non research professors) though
12/9/19, 5:39 PM - Matt Casali: Sucks for physics
12/9/19, 5:39 PM - Alex Starr: Not for research in physics though
12/9/19, 5:59 PM - Ricky: Her???!!???
12/9/19, 6:01 PM - Alex Starr: I’d send the eye roll emoji but I don’t think it does justice
12/9/19, 6:01 PM - Ricky: I’m just curious who this girl is?
12/9/19, 6:01 PM - Ricky: Must know her fairly well if ur discussing post grad stuff
12/9/19, 6:02 PM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
12/9/19, 6:02 PM - Collin Hurst: How's that Alex
12/9/19, 6:02 PM - Darren: Oh shit it blinks
12/9/19, 6:03 PM - Alex Starr: She’s the the other undergrad in the lab I work in
12/9/19, 6:05 PM - Ricky: They should rename your lab to “Alex’s sex place”
12/9/19, 6:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha
12/9/19, 6:05 PM - Ricky: For all the fuckin u been doin I’m there
12/9/19, 6:05 PM - Alex Starr: Not cool
12/9/19, 6:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: That’d be a good name for a bakery
12/9/19, 6:07 PM - Ricky: I hope you’re not with all that kinetic energy your producing
12/9/19, 6:07 PM - Alex Starr: ^
12/9/19, 6:08 PM - Darren: The random aggression coming from ricky
12/9/19, 6:10 PM - Ricky: Aha sorry idk
12/9/19, 6:10 PM - Ricky: Been watching the new season of Silicon Valley
12/9/19, 6:10 PM - Ricky: Russ is back and ye keeps talking about fuckin
12/9/19, 6:12 PM - Collin Hurst: Who does the fuckin? Alex does the fuckin
12/9/19, 6:13 PM - Jason Greenberg: Settle down
12/9/19, 6:14 PM - Collin Hurst: did you guys see that video
12/9/19, 6:14 PM - Ricky: Link
12/9/19, 6:15 PM - Collin Hurst: its in r/media boi
12/9/19, 6:24 PM - Parker: Fred’s does the fuckin!
12/9/19, 6:24 PM - Parker: everybody knows that
12/9/19, 6:48 PM - Tim Ko: Lmao
12/9/19, 6:49 PM - Tim Ko: That’s how it starts 😁
12/9/19, 6:49 PM - Ricky: Watched it, quality vid hahaha
12/9/19, 6:55 PM - Alex Starr: Would quit it have been more effective than not cool?
12/9/19, 7:57 PM - Ricky: ahha idk sry
12/9/19, 7:58 PM - Ricky: just having a quick laugh lol
12/9/19, 8:47 PM - Parker: so are we doing workouts over break??
12/9/19, 8:47 PM - Ricky: We better
12/9/19, 8:47 PM - Alex Starr: It’s all good.  Some circumstances make it iffy.
12/9/19, 8:48 PM - Parker: can we go to your gym :))
12/9/19, 8:48 PM - Tim Ko: Bench baby
12/9/19, 8:48 PM - Tim Ko: That’s all I’ve been doing this semester
12/9/19, 8:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: In other unpopular opinions, I'd rather not spend a bunch just to get to the party for new years. What if we got hammered at a nearby game bar
12/9/19, 8:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: Down
12/9/19, 8:50 PM - Alex Starr: Game bar?
12/9/19, 8:50 PM - Alex Starr: I’d much rather go to sf
12/9/19, 8:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: It doesn't have to be a game bar if that's what you mean
12/9/19, 8:51 PM - Alex Starr: I do not
12/9/19, 8:51 PM - Alex Starr: Collin still isn’t 21
12/9/19, 8:51 PM - Alex Starr: Among other things
12/9/19, 8:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: But ubers are going to be triple surging probably
12/9/19, 8:51 PM - Alex Starr: I can do that
12/9/19, 8:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: We haven't thought about that but what would have been 20 bucks one way per person turns into 60 each way
12/9/19, 8:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: Or maybe you have and don't care
12/9/19, 8:52 PM - Alex Starr: What if I told you I had parking
12/9/19, 8:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: Let's see how it plays out
12/9/19, 8:52 PM - Alex Starr: ^
12/9/19, 8:52 PM - Alex Starr: And an electric car
12/9/19, 8:52 PM - Alex Starr: So it was literally free
12/9/19, 8:53 PM - Ricky: Well ya gotta explain this mr mischievous
12/9/19, 8:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: I would say that we can't drive back in it until the next day
12/9/19, 8:53 PM - Ricky: Also we can take the train but obvi my opinion bias
12/9/19, 8:53 PM - Alex Starr: No I don’t it’s really not worth going into
12/9/19, 8:54 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah if we leave in the morning no problem
12/9/19, 8:54 PM - Alex Starr: I mean literally any time in the morning
12/9/19, 8:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: I'm trying to convince Hayley to come but she doesn't want to sleep on the floor with randos at this apartment and I understand that
12/9/19, 8:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: So we'd have to uber both ways
12/9/19, 8:55 PM - Collin Hurst: I imagine we'd take the train up
12/9/19, 8:55 PM - Collin Hurst: we could take it back too
12/9/19, 8:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: She don't wanna ride it after midnight so only one way
12/9/19, 8:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: for us anyway
12/9/19, 8:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: that's easily 70 bucks in transport
12/9/19, 8:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: Wait actually more probably bc we wouldn't have a full car on the way back
12/9/19, 8:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: Can you blame me for not wanting to shell that out?
12/9/19, 8:57 PM - Collin Hurst: you could take the train back the next day?
12/9/19, 8:57 PM - Parker: Yeah train both ways would work
12/9/19, 8:57 PM - Ricky: But they don’t wanna sleepy there
12/9/19, 8:58 PM - Collin Hurst: 70 is a lot
12/9/19, 8:58 PM - Collin Hurst: ohh
12/9/19, 8:58 PM - Parker: Oh
12/9/19, 8:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: yeah
12/9/19, 8:58 PM - Collin Hurst: well im probably going to go that party cause im under 21 lol
12/9/19, 8:58 PM - Alex Starr: And Ricky will certainly go
12/9/19, 8:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ofc
12/9/19, 8:59 PM - Alex Starr: Puts things in an awkward spot
12/9/19, 8:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: I know
12/9/19, 8:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: Unless there's a cheaper way I'm most likely out boys
12/9/19, 9:00 PM - Alex Starr: Although it doesn’t if Tim is willing to DD though that’s a big ask
12/9/19, 9:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: There's still time to brainstorm until the party so haven't entirely given up hope
12/9/19, 9:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: But looking grim
12/9/19, 9:00 PM - Collin Hurst: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/23521230?adults=6&check_in=2019-12-31&check_out=2020-01-01&source_impression_id=p3_1575953980_un5sjdh69ROCkUff
12/9/19, 9:00 PM - Collin Hurst: this 6 person airbnb would be 30 each if only 6 in it
12/9/19, 9:00 PM - Collin Hurst: short uber from downtown
12/9/19, 9:01 PM - Alex Starr: Prob sums to 40-50$
12/9/19, 9:01 PM - Collin Hurst: assuming we only do 6 too
12/9/19, 9:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: how much are train tickets
12/9/19, 9:01 PM - Alex Starr: 5 bucks
12/9/19, 9:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: to and fro
12/9/19, 9:01 PM - Collin Hurst: 9 each way
12/9/19, 9:01 PM - Alex Starr: If we Bart 1 way

12/9/19, 9:02 PM - Ricky: Lmao
12/9/19, 9:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: No we don't gotta use your fake

12/9/19, 9:04 PM - Parker: Bruh
12/9/19, 9:04 PM - Alex Starr: Don’t get me wrong, Bart is a terrible idea
12/9/19, 9:04 PM - Collin Hurst: if we get 10 peeps in the airbnb thats 22 each
12/9/19, 9:04 PM - Parker: I’m staying home if we do that hahah
12/9/19, 9:04 PM - Parker: the fremont that is

12/9/19, 9:08 PM - Collin Hurst: bet I could get at least a couple couches for the night for yall
12/9/19, 9:08 PM - Ricky: Or Bart to my aunts! Haha
12/9/19, 9:08 PM - Matt Casali: You cant do that to yourself!
12/9/19, 9:08 PM - Alex Starr: You have done that yourself
12/9/19, 9:09 PM - Collin Hurst: r/brandnewsentence
12/9/19, 9:09 PM - Matt Casali: There we go
12/9/19, 9:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: I'd def take that option if you can pull it
12/9/19, 9:09 PM - Darren: You don't matter jason
12/9/19, 9:09 PM - Darren: Hayley's opinion is the one that matters
12/9/19, 9:09 PM - Darren: I didn't mean to come out swinging
12/9/19, 9:10 PM - Collin Hurst: Ill bet you your location on NYE that I can pull it
12/9/19, 9:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: Look at this big couple energy over here
12/9/19, 9:11 PM - Alex Starr: So what’re other people gonna do?
12/9/19, 9:11 PM - Alex Starr: To get their I mean
12/9/19, 9:11 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz no guarantee I can actually get free parking.  Caltrain sounds good to me
12/9/19, 9:12 PM - Matt Casali: I'm gonna talk with juj and figure it out then I'll try to let you guys know as soon as I can
12/9/19, 9:12 PM - Ricky: Just a reminder, you can take Bart to Oakland
12/9/19, 9:12 PM - Ricky: If that effects any decisions
12/9/19, 9:13 PM - Alex Starr: Could also Bart to Berkeley.  But it doesn’t since hason are anti-train after midnight
12/9/19, 9:13 PM - Jason Greenberg: You pass the comprehension check
12/9/19, 9:13 PM - Collin Hurst: can't wait to see dump for our 1 year anniversary
12/9/19, 9:14 PM - Ricky: Hahahahaha
12/9/19, 9:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh god haha
12/9/19, 9:14 PM - Matt Casali: I'm sure she's excited to you
12/9/19, 9:15 PM - Collin Hurst: the trains sound like ass after midnight
12/9/19, 9:15 PM - Alex Starr: I like the lack of a verb
12/9/19, 9:15 PM - Alex Starr: Why
12/9/19, 9:15 PM - Collin Hurst: standing drunk and tired for 1.5 hours
12/9/19, 9:15 PM - Matt Casali: I have a problem, that keeps happening
12/9/19, 9:15 PM - Matt Casali: My brain just skips
12/9/19, 9:15 PM - Alex Starr: It’s fine
12/9/19, 9:15 PM - Collin Hurst: at least caltrain
12/9/19, 9:15 PM - Alex Starr: Like a mad lib
12/9/19, 9:15 PM - Alex Starr: Why
12/9/19, 9:15 PM - Collin Hurst: ^
12/9/19, 9:16 PM - Alex Starr: You’ve swayed me
12/9/19, 9:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah it would be quite a time
12/9/19, 9:17 PM - Alex Starr: Barting to Berkeley wouldn’t be bad
12/9/19, 9:17 PM - Alex Starr: 25 minutes of sitting
12/9/19, 9:17 PM - Collin Hurst: doubt we would get to sit
12/9/19, 9:18 PM - Alex Starr: We might
12/9/19, 9:18 PM - Alex Starr: It’s a much shorter time frame regardless
12/9/19, 9:18 PM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
12/9/19, 9:18 PM - Alex Starr: Looking like floor sleeping then
12/9/19, 9:19 PM - Ricky: Did Collins hookup fall through?
12/9/19, 9:19 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t think that was for all of us
12/9/19, 9:19 PM - Collin Hurst: what hookup
12/9/19, 9:19 PM - Alex Starr: Just for Hayjay
12/9/19, 9:20 PM - Ricky: Thought u said something about pple with couches
12/9/19, 9:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: That’s not a bad one
12/9/19, 9:20 PM - Collin Hurst: yes
12/9/19, 9:20 PM - Alex Starr: Right?
12/9/19, 9:20 PM - Collin Hurst: where is Todd's studio?
12/9/19, 9:21 PM - Alex Starr: Was so so confused for a second there
12/9/19, 9:21 PM - Parker: Agreed
12/9/19, 9:21 PM - Parker: Lol
12/9/19, 9:22 PM - Alex Starr: What if we drove up to Berkeley, pregamed there then did something that made sense after that
12/9/19, 9:22 PM - Ricky: It was kind of a joke but my aunts house is like a half an hour Bart away and has like 3 for real beds extra, I can ask her if u would consider it/ we needed it
12/9/19, 9:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: That’s v helpful
12/9/19, 9:23 PM - Collin Hurst: oooo
12/9/19, 9:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: Let’s see how close Collins thing is
12/9/19, 9:23 PM - Alex Starr: So is my apartment and I can guarantee use of that
12/9/19, 9:24 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz then it’s a much shorter trip
12/9/19, 9:24 PM - Collin Hurst: uber back to berkeley would be cheaper too if needed
12/9/19, 9:25 PM - Ricky: 315 s van ness
12/9/19, 9:25 PM - Collin Hurst: so the only cost for the night apart from gas there and back would be bart there and bart/uber back
12/9/19, 9:25 PM - Matt Casali: He says: which one??
12/9/19, 9:26 PM - Alex Starr: Pretty much
12/9/19, 9:26 PM - Alex Starr: Bet that’s under 30
12/9/19, 9:26 PM - Alex Starr: Like a goddamn CS interview
12/9/19, 9:27 PM - Matt Casali: I think Juj's house is super close so maybe we would be able to just go back to her place that night
12/9/19, 9:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: For real?
12/9/19, 9:28 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t think that was the royal we
12/9/19, 9:28 PM - Alex Starr: That was Matt and juj we
12/9/19, 9:28 PM - Collin Hurst: my housemate Lucas is having a NYE party and says I can crash there with some peeps
12/9/19, 9:28 PM - Parker: and mucho alcohol
12/9/19, 9:28 PM - Matt Casali: Yes haha, sorry I realize that was confusing
12/9/19, 9:29 PM - Parker: where?
12/9/19, 9:29 PM - Collin Hurst: upper Richmond District
12/9/19, 9:29 PM - Collin Hurst: a little far but not crazy relatively
12/9/19, 9:30 PM - Alex Starr: Might as well go to Berkeley then
12/9/19, 9:30 PM - Alex Starr: Unless I’m confused on location
12/9/19, 9:32 PM - Collin Hurst: district
12/9/19, 9:32 PM - Alex Starr: Ah
12/9/19, 9:33 PM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
12/9/19, 9:33 PM - Alex Starr: Berkeley might actually be faster haha
12/9/19, 9:36 PM - Ricky: Well let’s see what the gf thinks
12/9/19, 9:37 PM - Alex Starr: Of the 100 options we came up with haha
12/9/19, 9:38 PM - Alex Starr: Also Tim may still dd who knows
12/9/19, 9:39 PM - Collin Hurst: that would be insanely clutch
12/9/19, 9:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: Dope
12/9/19, 9:39 PM - Alex Starr: I’d ask him but he isn’t here
12/9/19, 9:40 PM - Alex Starr: Also Jason if that falls through we could do Berkeley under 30$
12/9/19, 9:40 PM - Ricky: So rn if it works it’d be us and 2 gfs (just so grace can do her headcount)
Lmk if anyone else wants to come so I can run it by her :D
12/9/19, 9:40 PM - Alex Starr: Yes
12/9/19, 9:41 PM - Alex Starr: It’ll work for Jason (we hope) idk about Matt
12/9/19, 9:42 PM - Matt Casali: Would I be able to invite two other friends?
12/9/19, 9:42 PM - Matt Casali: Potentially?
12/9/19, 9:42 PM - Collin Hurst: oh my
12/9/19, 9:42 PM - Collin Hurst: is it...
12/9/19, 9:43 PM - Alex Starr: Why? Jc
12/9/19, 9:43 PM - Matt Casali: Dump and waste basket
12/9/19, 9:44 PM - Matt Casali: Cause they expressed interest in doing something in doing nye with me and juj but idk if they'd actually wanna go
12/9/19, 9:44 PM - Alex Starr: Please tell me that’s actually someone’s nickname
12/9/19, 9:44 PM - Matt Casali: Sadly, no
12/9/19, 9:45 PM - Alex Starr: Rough draw
12/9/19, 9:46 PM - Parker: 🥰🥰
12/9/19, 9:46 PM - Collin Hurst: Rachel may be interested
12/9/19, 9:46 PM - Parker: Wait so where are the rest of us staying
12/9/19, 9:47 PM - Collin Hurst: on the streets
12/9/19, 9:47 PM - Parker: For sure
12/9/19, 9:47 PM - Collin Hurst: we could just pull an all nighter and walk the streets until its light out
12/9/19, 9:47 PM - Parker: Training for pamsterdam
12/9/19, 9:48 PM - Collin Hurst: and then drive home when we're sober enough
12/9/19, 9:48 PM - Alex Starr: Berkeley Parker

12/11/19, 11:10 AM - Darren: Saturday
12/11/19, 11:48 AM - Alex Starr: Have I told you guys that I hate dead week?
12/11/19, 11:48 AM - Collin Hurst: Yep
12/11/19, 11:48 AM - Darren: 7 times so far
12/11/19, 11:49 AM - Alex Starr: Glad that I’m getting that info out there
12/11/19, 11:55 AM - Tim Ko: I love it
12/11/19, 11:55 AM - Tim Ko: I feel so prepared for my finals
12/11/19, 11:56 AM - Alex Starr: If everyone else is unprepared it doesn’t matter
12/11/19, 11:57 AM - Alex Starr: Plus I question how helpful it is for long term retention of the info
12/11/19, 11:57 AM - Alex Starr: Plus I do worse relatively the easier the exam is
12/11/19, 11:57 AM - Alex Starr: And it’s literally 8 weeks of my life gone
12/11/19, 11:58 AM - Jason Greenberg: Makes some cards
12/11/19, 11:58 AM - Jason Greenberg: You’ll feel better
12/11/19, 11:58 AM - Alex Starr: I don’t have a snickers
12/11/19, 11:58 AM - Tim Ko: Same
12/11/19, 11:58 AM - Tim Ko: It actually helps for me a lot
12/11/19, 11:58 AM - Alex Starr: Then dead week hurts you haha
12/11/19, 11:58 AM - Tim Ko: Actually just in general, studying material multiple times helps me retain
12/11/19, 11:58 AM - Alex Starr: You’ve never not had dead week.  There’s no control on this study
12/11/19, 11:59 AM - Alex Starr: Right but no dead week you’d just study the week before
12/11/19, 11:59 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah but I’ve had tests where I’ve crammed and I don’t remember anything Ng
12/11/19, 11:59 AM - Tim Ko: No dead week would probably involve less thoroughness
12/11/19, 11:59 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah true but less
12/11/19, 12:01 PM - Alex Starr: Less studying is a win
12/11/19, 12:02 PM - Alex Starr: Diminishing returns and all that
12/11/19, 12:23 PM - Matt Casali: Neither have you tho
12/11/19, 12:23 PM - Matt Casali: But I like not having dead week haha
12/11/19, 12:27 PM - Alex Starr: I meant for testing memory retention
12/11/19, 12:28 PM - Alex Starr: I know with no deadweek, I’d just study harder in the preceding weeks
12/11/19, 12:28 PM - Darren: Nerd
12/11/19, 1:31 PM - Collin Hurst: miss you all, I'll be done in 24 hours woohoo!
12/11/19, 3:16 PM - Parker: YEET
12/11/19, 9:25 PM - Alex Starr: What if instead of secret Santa/white elephant, we pooled our money for a dope meal in Paris
12/11/19, 9:27 PM - Matt Casali: Yes that would be very fun
12/11/19, 9:27 PM - Alex Starr: I know that’s not likely to be a popular suggestion, but I like it enough I figured it was worth putting out there
12/11/19, 9:27 PM - Alex Starr: You can still go
12/11/19, 9:35 PM - Darren: I'm down to go to le arpege
12/11/19, 9:35 PM - Alex Starr: For 160 dollars we can get a third of a meal total
12/11/19, 9:36 PM - Alex Starr: Not that I’m not down
12/11/19, 9:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: Confused and I’m hyped for white elephant
12/11/19, 9:48 PM - Alex Starr: 20 dollars per person toward a dope meal
12/11/19, 9:58 PM - Ricky: Boooooo
12/11/19, 9:58 PM - Ricky: Gift exchange!!!!
12/11/19, 9:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: I'm hearing 20 dollar Cheesecake factory gift card
12/11/19, 10:02 PM - Alex Starr: I knew it wouldn’t be popular
12/11/19, 10:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Just so we're clear, your proposal is to earmark 20 dollars per person so each person can spend an additional 40 dollars in the future?
12/11/19, 10:04 PM - Alex Starr: Not necessarily that
12/11/19, 10:04 PM - Alex Starr: But earmark it yes
12/11/19, 10:05 PM - Alex Starr: Maybe spend an extra 10
12/11/19, 10:05 PM - Alex Starr: Idk thought a nice meal would be cooler than gift exchange
12/11/19, 10:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: Doesn't have to be either or
12/11/19, 10:21 PM - Ricky: Let’s pls just do gift exchange
12/11/19, 10:22 PM - Alex Starr: We could vote on it
12/11/19, 10:23 PM - Darren: Food exchange
12/12/19, 7:08 AM - Alex Starr: Looking 2-1 in favor of food exchange
12/12/19, 8:36 AM - Ricky: Bruhhhh
12/12/19, 8:36 AM - Ricky: We gonna eat no matter what, we shouldn’t exclude an event of good times for it
12/12/19, 8:43 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah but we could eat better stuff
12/12/19, 8:48 AM - Matt Casali: And exclude matthew in the process!
12/12/19, 8:52 AM - Alex Starr: Obviously I would get you a gift
12/12/19, 8:58 AM - Matt Casali: Really?
12/12/19, 8:58 AM - Matt Casali: Nah we should just do a gift exchange for everyone
12/12/19, 8:58 AM - Matt Casali: Also very random question: does anyone have a large reservoir of legos?
12/12/19, 9:00 AM - Alex Starr: Hard maybe
12/12/19, 9:00 AM - Alex Starr: So either yes or we gave them away
12/12/19, 9:01 AM - Alex Starr: If we do that you’ll never know if I would have
12/12/19, 9:02 AM - Matt Casali: If you do, could we borrow them and get high one night and build with them??
12/12/19, 9:02 AM - Matt Casali: I can live with that
12/12/19, 9:04 AM - Alex Starr: I’m leaning no
12/12/19, 9:04 AM - Matt Casali: Ok
12/12/19, 9:06 AM - Alex Starr: I just don’t really want to see Collin spend 4 hours and an entire pack of Oreos on the LEGO version of dick from the front
12/12/19, 9:06 AM - Ricky: I deff got diploma
12/12/19, 9:06 AM - Ricky: Duplos*?
12/12/19, 9:07 AM - Ricky: Hahaha wait that sounds awesome 😂
12/12/19, 9:08 AM - Ricky: I can ask around, we deff used to have like a gigantic tub worth along with boxes on boxes of sorted ones
12/12/19, 9:12 AM - Parker: Lol sounds kinda fun
12/12/19, 9:51 AM - Collin Hurst: We cook for each other except matt
12/12/19, 9:51 AM - Collin Hurst: We all buy him little toy trumpets
12/12/19, 9:51 AM - Alex Starr: What about cooking?
12/12/19, 9:52 AM - Alex Starr: I don’t think anyone has mentioned cooking
12/12/19, 9:55 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah, right?? It would be so cool
12/12/19, 10:03 AM - Ricky: Bruh, lets do white elephant with fun games mixed in

12/12/19, 10:27 AM - Alex Starr: I know
12/12/19, 10:36 AM - Parker: Lol i’m jk
12/12/19, 10:37 AM - Parker: I’m not feeling the gift exchange this year idk why
12/12/19, 10:37 AM - Parker: i think bc i’d rather save the money and put it towards our trip
12/12/19, 10:44 AM - Matt Casali: Its
12/12/19, 10:44 AM - Matt Casali: 20 dollars?
12/12/19, 10:46 AM - Collin Hurst: 20 bucks is a small price to pay for some tradition
12/12/19, 10:49 AM - Matt Casali: I'm the guy who didnt wanna pay more than 700 dollars for a trip and even I dont think 20 is that much
12/12/19, 10:50 AM - Jason Greenberg: 500*
12/12/19, 10:51 AM - Matt Casali: Even better
12/12/19, 10:52 AM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah I’m with ya
12/12/19, 10:52 AM - Collin Hurst: well youre not going on the trip so you p much have 1500 dollars more than him cause of that
12/12/19, 11:15 AM - Alex Starr: Just to put it out there, that seems to be me Parker Darren who aren’t feeling the gift exchange
12/12/19, 11:19 AM - Jason Greenberg: I forget is one third bigger than two thirds?
12/12/19, 11:20 AM - Matt Casali: Theres a lot of debate from what Ive heard
12/12/19, 11:20 AM - Parker: i have no job and idk how long i’ll be jobless after i graduate so i’m gonna have to start focusing on saving money
12/12/19, 11:20 AM - Collin Hurst: Godaamn feeling a little chippy today eh
12/12/19, 11:20 AM - Collin Hurst: We can do it without em if they don't want to no biggie!
12/12/19, 11:20 AM - Parker: especially if i wanna be able to do a big trip like the one we’re planning
12/12/19, 11:20 AM - Alex Starr: I’m down to do something simple
12/12/19, 11:20 AM - Matt Casali: I get that, but alsoooo you can just bring something you dont use anymore to the gift exchange
12/12/19, 11:20 AM - Alex Starr: Cuz it seems to mean a lot to some people
12/12/19, 11:20 AM - Parker: /i have to buy presents for all of my fam
12/12/19, 11:21 AM - Jason Greenberg: I’d be down to lower the gift budget if that’s the issue
12/12/19, 11:21 AM - Parker: Ohh are we still doing that
12/12/19, 11:21 AM - Alex Starr: It’s completely unclear what we’re doing still haha
12/12/19, 11:21 AM - Parker: there’s been so many suggestions thrown out that i’m lost lol
12/12/19, 11:21 AM - Matt Casali: You can if you don't wanna pay for a gift
12/12/19, 11:21 AM - Jason Greenberg: ^
12/12/19, 11:21 AM - Parker: True okay
12/12/19, 11:22 AM - Parker: ill find something good
12/12/19, 11:22 AM - Matt Casali: I think we just decided on white elephant
12/12/19, 11:23 AM - Alex Starr: A decision I now regret as it seems to be becoming quite the production haha
12/12/19, 11:23 AM - Jason Greenberg: You suggested this originally to be fair
12/12/19, 11:24 AM - Alex Starr: It’s quickly escalated
12/12/19, 11:24 AM - Matt Casali: I regret it too
12/12/19, 11:24 AM - Collin Hurst: When did that happen
12/12/19, 11:24 AM - Alex Starr: What was some light invasion of Poland has turned into WWII
12/12/19, 11:24 AM - Matt Casali: But no turning back now
12/12/19, 11:24 AM - Alex Starr: There absolutely is
12/12/19, 11:25 AM - Parker: ^
12/12/19, 11:25 AM - Matt Casali: Idk lol I was just trying to be decisive
12/12/19, 11:25 AM - Collin Hurst: nice try
12/12/19, 11:27 AM - Jason Greenberg: Chill coll
12/12/19, 11:27 AM - Jason Greenberg: We can poll it
12/12/19, 11:27 AM - Alex Starr: Sticking with the Poland theme
12/12/19, 11:28 AM - Jason Greenberg: Lol
12/12/19, 11:29 AM - Matt Casali: I can do ot
12/12/19, 11:29 AM - Matt Casali: I'm at work and so bored
12/12/19, 11:29 AM - Alex Starr: I’m on it already
12/12/19, 11:29 AM - Matt Casali: Booooooooo
12/12/19, 11:29 AM - Matt Casali: That was meant to be noooooo but that also works
12/12/19, 11:30 AM - Jason Greenberg: Sometimes it takes more than one poll
12/12/19, 11:31 AM - Matt Casali: I'll make a poll since alex and I seem to be on opposite sides so that we cancel out bias
12/12/19, 11:33 AM - Alex Starr: Idk this was pretty unbiased as far as my polls usually go
12/12/19, 11:34 AM - Parker: The bar wasn’t set too high
12/12/19, 11:34 AM - Matt Casali: ^
12/12/19, 11:39 AM - Alex Starr: Well yeah
12/12/19, 11:39 AM - Alex Starr: Gotta be able to have goals
12/12/19, 11:39 AM - Alex Starr: I don’t say fuck you at any point
12/12/19, 11:39 AM - Alex Starr: You didn’t even see the forms!
12/12/19, 11:40 AM - Jason Greenberg: I made one too
12/12/19, 11:43 AM - Alex Starr: Lol
12/12/19, 11:44 AM - Alex Starr: Someone needs to come in with a meta form about the form making process
12/12/19, 11:44 AM - Alex Starr: How’re ur finals Jason?
12/12/19, 11:48 AM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
12/12/19, 11:48 AM - Jason Greenberg: Just one left and it’s take home
12/12/19, 11:49 AM - Jason Greenberg: I took working memory and an attention lab this quarter which was a blessing and a curse
12/12/19, 11:50 AM - Jason Greenberg: A lot of overlapping material but a lot of abstract work to learn that we can only hold four items in working memory but also maybe more but we don’t know and here are a bunch of other models
12/12/19, 11:51 AM - Alex Starr: The classic we don’t know shit
12/12/19, 11:51 AM - Alex Starr: Is it really only 4? How on earth do you control that kind of study?
12/12/19, 11:54 AM - Jason Greenberg: Well I’ll respond with we don’t really know and I don’t understand really well
12/12/19, 11:55 AM - Jason Greenberg: A lot of techniques measure activity during the delay between a stimulus presentation and when you’re asked to recall it
12/12/19, 11:56 AM - Jason Greenberg: But there’s a problem with circular logic where some studies will say we found activity in this region that is often active during x and so therefore it is WM
12/12/19, 11:57 AM - Jason Greenberg: I can send you an interesting paper if you want
12/12/19, 11:57 AM - Jason Greenberg: Short
12/12/19, 11:58 AM - Tim Ko: I think one year ricky gave me some Advil and condoms so prker u rlly don’t have to spend much
12/12/19, 12:08 PM - Alex Starr: Sure
12/12/19, 12:08 PM - Alex Starr: On the paper
12/12/19, 2:44 PM - Darren: Depends on how it gets split
12/12/19, 2:45 PM - Alex Starr: If we assume the axiom of choice, I can turn my 1/3 into infinitely many 1/3s, and then it will be infinity to 2/3
12/12/19, 2:49 PM - Darren: Ok, a 2/3 with Alex on it is < 1/3
12/12/19, 2:49 PM - Alex Starr: If 7/9 < 2/9 I’ll switch to pro secret Santa so fast
12/12/19, 4:12 PM - Ricky: haah sry timmy, just want you to be safe
12/12/19, 4:28 PM - Tim Ko: Hahaha
12/12/19, 4:29 PM - Darren: Condoms are not a bad gift
12/12/19, 4:29 PM - Tim Ko: I mean u could look at it as that gift saving 18 yrs of child support
12/12/19, 4:29 PM - Tim Ko: So worth a lot
12/12/19, 4:30 PM - Darren: Little do you know, Ricky pricked holes in them
12/12/19, 4:30 PM - Tim Ko: Do they have an expiration date?

12/29/19, 6:17 PM - Parker: it’s the pain relieving component of weed
12/29/19, 6:21 PM - Alex Starr: Ah

12/29/19, 8:53 PM - Parker: YUH
12/29/19, 11:53 PM - Alex Starr: Not gonna make it, pretty tired.  See everyone the 31st.  We should develop a more concrete plan for it too.
12/30/19, 12:00 AM - Parker: I agree
12/30/19, 2:13 AM - Vaughn: Everyone get home safe?
12/30/19, 2:26 AM - Parker: yee
12/30/19, 10:20 AM - Jason Greenberg: <Media omitted>
12/30/19, 10:35 AM - Ricky: Fabulous
12/30/19, 10:36 AM - Parker: gotem
12/30/19, 11:15 AM - Matt Casali: I may have never laughed as hard as I did at ricky and Vaughn's synchronized dancing
12/30/19, 11:20 AM - Jason Greenberg: You were really enjoying that haha
12/30/19, 11:32 AM - Parker: I don’t think i’ve ever seen someone laugh as hard lol
12/30/19, 11:32 AM - Ricky: Hahahahah
12/30/19, 2:41 PM - Parker: group bevmo run tomorrow?
12/30/19, 2:43 PM - Alex Starr: What time are we planning on heading up
12/30/19, 2:43 PM - Alex Starr: And is the plan still Berkeley first
12/30/19, 2:43 PM - Alex Starr: And who is going
12/30/19, 2:46 PM - Parker: TBD, yes, and everyone except tim i believe
12/30/19, 2:46 PM - Parker: Bart or uber to the city and back
12/30/19, 2:47 PM - Parker: But more importantly, group bevmo run tomorrow?
12/30/19, 2:54 PM - Alex Starr: Oh so no Berkeley
12/30/19, 2:54 PM - Alex Starr: Just straight up Uber there and back
12/30/19, 2:54 PM - Parker: What no we’re going to berkeley
12/30/19, 2:55 PM - Parker: i mean berkeley to the city and back to berkeley
12/30/19, 2:55 PM - Alex Starr: Ah okay
12/30/19, 2:55 PM - Alex Starr: We should try to leave Berkeley at or before 11
12/30/19, 2:56 PM - Alex Starr: On the 1st I mean
12/30/19, 2:56 PM - Alex Starr: And idk if Jason and Matt are going to Berkeley beforehand was what I meant with who is coming
12/30/19, 2:57 PM - Parker: I vote before
12/30/19, 2:57 PM - Parker: Oh gotcha yeah everyone is gonna do berkeley i believe but matt will split off afterwards and i’m not sure about jason
12/30/19, 2:57 PM - Parker: and bart might be better since it runs until 3 and uber will have surge pricing
12/30/19, 2:58 PM - Parker: But you can sometimes get free uber codes on new year’s so that could be a move too
12/30/19, 3:01 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah we will just have to see how it goes
12/30/19, 3:01 PM - Alex Starr: Deal
12/30/19, 3:01 PM - Alex Starr: What time are we targeting to head to Berkeley/what time does the party start
12/30/19, 3:06 PM - Collin Hurst: Why the rush?
12/30/19, 3:07 PM - Vaughn: We could do a new year brunch in berkeley
12/30/19, 3:13 PM - Jason Greenberg: It’s a no from me
12/30/19, 3:14 PM - Alex Starr: Family wants me back
12/30/19, 3:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: We’re driving to my sisters apartment in the city and then meeting everyone in sf
12/30/19, 3:14 PM - Alex Starr: Staying in Berkeley Jason?
12/30/19, 3:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: Staying at my sisters
12/30/19, 3:14 PM - Alex Starr: Kk
12/30/19, 3:15 PM - Parker: I wanna get back early for the rose bowl but i can always drive separately
12/30/19, 3:15 PM - Alex Starr: Drive me
12/30/19, 3:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: Turns out she moved in sooner than I thought
12/30/19, 3:15 PM - Alex Starr: I had the same reason partially Parker
12/30/19, 3:15 PM - Alex Starr: Oregon Wisconsin is a big one considering my mom is from Wisconsin but went to Oregon
12/30/19, 3:16 PM - Alex Starr: Ah okay Jason just trying to get a headcount
12/30/19, 3:16 PM - Alex Starr: Although if you are staying at your sisters it may just be easier to Uber or Caltrain to MV?
12/30/19, 3:17 PM - Collin Hurst: I'm gonna hang with Julia on the first in Berkeley so will need my car
12/30/19, 3:18 PM - Alex Starr: This is getting complicated
12/30/19, 3:20 PM - Alex Starr: So I take it you’re opposed to going back to MV right after the party Collin?
12/30/19, 3:20 PM - Collin Hurst: Ye
12/30/19, 3:21 PM - Darren: Damn, Julia is going the distance for you
12/30/19, 3:22 PM - Alex Starr: So I guess Parker, Collin can drive (if everyone is willing to leave early with Parker) or we can take 3 cars and pray for parking
12/30/19, 3:22 PM - Alex Starr: There’s a Bart joke in there somewhere
12/30/19, 3:23 PM - Parker: oh that’s dope i didn’t know she was from wisconsin
12/30/19, 3:24 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah they moved to LA pretty early on but spent summers there
12/30/19, 3:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: Not sure I understand. I’m planning on driving up and driving home the next day
12/30/19, 3:26 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah the question was directed at everyone sorry
12/30/19, 3:26 PM - Parker: I’m also not totally against coming straight home
12/30/19, 3:26 PM - Parker: I’m not totally following here though haha
12/30/19, 3:26 PM - Alex Starr: It has a lot of perks
12/30/19, 3:27 PM - Parker: but then we couldn’t drive to berkeley
12/30/19, 3:27 PM - Parker: Atleast i wouldn’t
12/30/19, 3:27 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah
12/30/19, 3:27 PM - Parker: But collin and his ass smelling car can
12/30/19, 3:27 PM - Alex Starr: That’s true
12/30/19, 3:27 PM - Alex Starr: So let’s just leave early from Berkeley Parker
12/30/19, 3:28 PM - Alex Starr: And others can either wait for Collin, leave early with us, or drive separately
12/30/19, 3:28 PM - Alex Starr: Although that doesn’t work cuz it’s my apartment
12/30/19, 3:28 PM - Alex Starr: So everyone is leaving early
12/30/19, 3:29 PM - Parker: Haha
12/30/19, 3:29 PM - Parker: Also me leaving early isn’t me volunteering to drive up but if no one else can then i can
12/30/19, 3:29 PM - Parker: but i’d prefer not to have my car there
12/30/19, 3:31 PM - Alex Starr: Okay so to summarize, 
1. Drive up tomorrow to Berkeley pregame there. Collin will drive as will someone else.  Matt and Jason likely won’t attend and I wouldn’t bet on Ricky coming either.
2. Bart or Uber to party.
3. Party.
4. Uber or Bart back to Berkeley.
5. Leave early in the morning (maybe 10?) and drive back to MV, without Collin.
12/30/19, 3:32 PM - Parker: sounds gucci
12/30/19, 3:32 PM - Vaughn: Looks about right
12/30/19, 3:32 PM - Parker: I think ricky is coming to berkeley
12/30/19, 3:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: Party starts at 9:30
12/30/19, 3:32 PM - Vaughn: Oh shiiiiiit we gotta get out of mv early
12/30/19, 3:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: we should show up between 10 and 10:30
12/30/19, 3:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: Obviously
12/30/19, 3:33 PM - Vaughn: No doubt
12/30/19, 3:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: Unless it’s a different kind of party
12/30/19, 3:33 PM - Parker: ^
12/30/19, 3:34 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah 10:15 sounds good.  Tho Ricky might want to show up earlier cuz grace is hosting
12/30/19, 3:34 PM - Collin Hurst: leave mv around 7 latest
12/30/19, 3:34 PM - Parker: ^
12/30/19, 3:34 PM - Alex Starr: Traffic will suck at that time
12/30/19, 3:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: Right
12/30/19, 3:34 PM - Parker: or even earlier
12/30/19, 3:34 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah we should leave at like 6
12/30/19, 3:36 PM - Alex Starr: Although if we leave at 6 we’d spend like an hour in Berkeley
12/30/19, 3:36 PM - Alex Starr: Would be way easier to just Uber up to SF and back after the party
12/30/19, 3:37 PM - Parker: but then we don’t have a good pregame spot
12/30/19, 3:38 PM - Alex Starr: Might be worth it though
12/30/19, 3:38 PM - Alex Starr: It saves like 90 minutes of driving
12/30/19, 3:38 PM - Collin Hurst: Expensive
12/30/19, 3:38 PM - Collin Hurst: Pregame is very important
12/30/19, 3:39 PM - Alex Starr: Not that much more.
12/30/19, 3:40 PM - Alex Starr: Uber to Berkeley from SF is pretty similar in cost to MV to SF
12/30/19, 3:40 PM - Collin Hurst: ac doe?
12/30/19, 3:40 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah
12/30/19, 3:41 PM - Collin Hurst: How lol it's so much closer
12/30/19, 3:41 PM - Alex Starr: I’ve done both and traffic near the bridge makes it comparable
12/30/19, 3:41 PM - Alex Starr: Probably be 55 minutes to MV and 40 to Berkeley
12/30/19, 3:41 PM - Alex Starr: Plus I’m willing to kick in extra for the Uber
12/30/19, 3:42 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah but traffic on the bridge at 2am?
12/30/19, 3:42 PM - Collin Hurst: it would just be all ubers
12/30/19, 3:42 PM - Alex Starr: Is absolutely a thing
12/30/19, 3:42 PM - Alex Starr: I’ve done it a couple times and it was actually a while
12/30/19, 3:49 PM - Parker: Surge pricing.
12/30/19, 3:50 PM - Parker: Uber will be more expensive then any other option u less we get free codes
12/30/19, 3:50 PM - Parker: and wouldn’t we do caltrain if that was the case
12/30/19, 4:05 PM - Matt Casali: What time are y'all leaving for berkeley?
12/30/19, 4:05 PM - Matt Casali: And what time are you coming back?
12/30/19, 4:31 PM - Alex Starr: Yes it will but we are ubering to and from Berkeley in the other plan which will be costly.  Uber from Fremont Bart is cheap
12/30/19, 4:31 PM - Parker: My ideal vote would be to pregame in berkeley then uber or bart and uber to MV after
12/30/19, 4:31 PM - Parker: Which is still possible
12/30/19, 4:31 PM - Alex Starr: That’s totally an option holy shit
12/30/19, 4:31 PM - Alex Starr: Did not consider that for some reason
12/30/19, 4:31 PM - Alex Starr: Completely on board with that it’s way better
12/30/19, 4:31 PM - Parker: That’s what i was saying earlier haha
12/30/19, 4:32 PM - Alex Starr: Didn’t realize haha
12/30/19, 4:32 PM - Parker: The only problem is we have one car
12/30/19, 4:32 PM - Alex Starr: Oh right
12/30/19, 4:32 PM - Parker: And also idk if collin would wanna drive still if we weren’t coming back to the apartment
12/30/19, 4:32 PM - Vaughn: Wait how are we getting to berkeley and whos ubering to mv in that scenario
12/30/19, 4:32 PM - Parker: so maybe that’s not an option lol
12/30/19, 4:34 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah
12/30/19, 4:34 PM - Alex Starr: I think no Berkeley might be best then
12/30/19, 4:39 PM - Parker: Then no pregame ://///
12/30/19, 4:43 PM - Ricky: Just come to the studio
12/30/19, 4:44 PM - Ricky: We don’t need to real pregame
12/30/19, 4:44 PM - Ricky: We can bring drinks there
12/30/19, 4:44 PM - Ricky: Maybe we can go to a bar or something?
12/30/19, 4:47 PM - Alex Starr: I’m down for Berkeley too
12/30/19, 4:47 PM - Parker: Yeah true but i’m showing up sober lol
12/30/19, 4:47 PM - Alex Starr: I’m trying to figure out shit on my end though
12/30/19, 4:47 PM - Parker: not *
12/30/19, 4:47 PM - Parker: not showing up sober** lmao
12/30/19, 4:48 PM - Parker: It’d be fun to have just a herd part of the night though
12/30/19, 4:48 PM - Parker: which would’ve been the pregame
12/30/19, 4:54 PM - Vaughn: I agree, especially since not all of us will be going to the studio
12/30/19, 4:55 PM - Vaughn: Future new years may be significantly harder to get 9/9 together, itd be nice to make the most out of this one
12/30/19, 4:58 PM - Parker: ^^exactlt
12/30/19, 4:58 PM - Parker: impossible*
12/30/19, 5:51 PM - Alex Starr: As long as we aim to leave by 10 in the morning, Berkeley is good
12/30/19, 5:51 PM - Alex Starr: I just have to remember my keys
12/30/19, 5:52 PM - Alex Starr: We might wanna aim to leave at 5:30 so we hit 6:00
12/30/19, 6:04 PM - Parker: Down
12/30/19, 6:04 PM - Parker: where should we meet
12/30/19, 6:19 PM - Matt Casali: That's when you're going to berkeley?
12/30/19, 6:20 PM - Alex Starr: Yes
12/30/19, 6:20 PM - Alex Starr: We should make a reservation at kenzo for 11
12/30/19, 6:20 PM - Vaughn: Kenzo is the 2nd
12/30/19, 6:20 PM - Matt Casali: What time are you going to Grace's then
12/30/19, 6:20 PM - Parker: Also my original question was never answered haha
12/30/19, 6:20 PM - Parker: ^!!
12/30/19, 6:21 PM - Parker: Probably 10
12/30/19, 6:21 PM - Vaughn: Yes yes yes!!
12/30/19, 6:21 PM - Collin Hurst: Do this
12/30/19, 6:21 PM - Vaughn: Dont pull a collin
12/30/19, 6:25 PM - Parker: I vote we all pitch in and buy alex alc for tomorrow for his bday
12/30/19, 6:28 PM - Matt Casali: Can I go with you guys and get dropped at Juj's house?
12/30/19, 6:29 PM - Ricky: Oh you know it, I’ll be making many a drinks for that man
12/30/19, 6:34 PM - Matt Casali: Are we planning on going to any bars in sf??
12/30/19, 6:34 PM - Ricky: Also, we can go to the studio whenever but grace gave me a good point that being late will just mean less time till New Years so getting there closer to 9 is prob better
12/30/19, 6:34 PM - Ricky: We can but not with Collin, and New Years seems like it’s a night to be more team players
12/30/19, 6:34 PM - Ricky: Or at least I’d feel bad ditching him
12/30/19, 6:35 PM - Matt Casali: True
12/30/19, 6:35 PM - Parker: If we go to a bar i’d buy you one alex but i didn’t know if that was the plan or not
12/30/19, 6:35 PM - Matt Casali: Dang collin cant wait until your 21
12/30/19, 6:35 PM - Collin Hurst: its ok im down to mingle in the studio if you guys want to leave lol
12/30/19, 6:35 PM - Matt Casali: *you're
12/30/19, 6:35 PM - Parker: Yee gotta bartend it up babyyyy
12/30/19, 6:36 PM - Matt Casali: Is 9 gonna happen?
12/30/19, 6:38 PM - Parker: I vote not 9 but that’s just me
12/30/19, 6:39 PM - Matt Casali: ^
12/30/19, 6:40 PM - Matt Casali: Juj and I are still trying to figure out exactly what our plan is but we're gonna see you all for a bit no matter what
12/30/19, 6:40 PM - Parker: With what would we drop you
12/30/19, 6:40 PM - Parker: aren’t we barting into the city
12/30/19, 6:40 PM - Matt Casali: On our way from mv to berkeley could I get dropped in oakland
12/30/19, 6:40 PM - Parker: Ohhh gotcha
12/30/19, 6:40 PM - Matt Casali: /what is Alex's address so I can see if it's on the way or not
12/30/19, 6:40 PM - Parker: Depending on traffic that’s prob doable
12/30/19, 7:05 PM - Alex Starr: 2514 piedmont avenue
12/30/19, 7:06 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah let’s show up reasonably on time to the party.  I’m down to stay there and not go to a bar, this is probably the last New Years with 8 of us
12/30/19, 7:08 PM - Alex Starr: But we should leave for Berkeley at 5:30
12/30/19, 7:08 PM - Alex Starr: We can meet at my house
12/30/19, 7:09 PM - Collin Hurst: down

12/30/19, 7:11 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah, you would just be dropping me off at juj's
12/30/19, 7:11 PM - Alex Starr: Oh I can do that
12/30/19, 7:11 PM - Alex Starr: I can also drive if my legs are feeling
12/30/19, 7:32 PM - Vaughn: For real this time, what in the world is everyone wearing tomorrow?

12/30/19, 7:51 PM - Matt Casali: Diddims for sure has suspenders too
12/30/19, 7:57 PM - Alex Starr: So what’s the advantage of adding a vest and jacket
12/30/19, 8:01 PM - Collin Hurst: They're looking for the 20s theme
12/30/19, 8:01 PM - Parker: ^

12/30/19, 8:06 PM - Alex Starr: I’m not gonna do suspenders

12/30/19, 8:10 PM - Ricky: Can we fit in one car?

1/22/20, 11:43 AM - Alex Starr: Nothing is isosceles there
1/22/20, 11:43 AM - Matt Casali: It wasnt in the beginning
1/22/20, 11:44 AM - Matt Casali: alpha*d1 = d1 + d0
1/22/20, 11:48 AM - Alex Starr: Idk those two pictures look very different I got nothing
1/22/20, 11:48 AM - Matt Casali: That's alright
1/22/20, 12:03 PM - Matt Casali: Looked it up, its unsolvable
1/22/20, 12:03 PM - Matt Casali: Damn
1/22/20, 12:13 PM - Matt Casali: Wait I did it
1/22/20, 12:13 PM - Matt Casali: Just gotta keep giving updates
1/22/20, 12:13 PM - Darren: Not with that attitude
1/22/20, 12:14 PM - Parker: Stop toying with my emotions
1/22/20, 1:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lol
1/22/20, 1:02 PM - Vaughn: Its unsolvable, but i solved it, no big deal 🥱
1/22/20, 1:02 PM - Collin Hurst: Lol

1/23/20, 11:34 AM - Jason Greenberg: Vaughn’s got some good ones ngl
1/23/20, 11:38 AM - Vaughn: Eyyy danke r/cursedcomments is a goldmine
1/23/20, 12:43 PM - Tim Ko: Haha
1/24/20, 8:31 PM - Ricky: When does he play and what’s his tag?
1/24/20, 9:22 PM - Matt Casali: /\
1/24/20, 10:16 PM - Darren: Player 5, idk when he plays
1/24/20, 10:16 PM - Darren: He played against void in doubles today and got 2-0d
1/24/20, 11:38 PM - Ricky: Ghad damn
1/24/20, 11:40 PM - Darren: He sent me a picture of nairo, and you could tell it was nairo because nairo was wearing a jacket that said nairo on it
1/24/20, 11:40 PM - Darren: Pretty sick
1/24/20, 11:46 PM - Ricky: Hahaha
1/24/20, 11:49 PM - Darren: Myran is in his pool so that's a tough draw
1/24/20, 11:52 PM - Alex Starr: 2 people get out of pools hopefully?
1/24/20, 11:54 PM - Darren: In theory
1/24/20, 11:54 PM - Darren: He just can't fuckup against any one except myran
1/24/20, 11:55 PM - Darren: (for context, myran is an olimar player and was #13 in the world for PGR season 1)
1/25/20, 12:00 AM - Alex Starr: Be a sick upset though
1/25/20, 12:00 AM - Darren: True
1/25/20, 12:00 AM - Alex Starr: But myran is pretty consistent no?
1/25/20, 12:00 AM - Alex Starr: Also are you going to breakfast
1/25/20, 12:01 AM - Alex Starr: And what time were we planning on? Hoping to avoid a hangover
1/25/20, 12:02 AM - Darren: Looking at his smashdata page, his last few losses at PGR events have been to: MuteAce, MKLeo, DarkWizzy, Mr. E, Dabuz, and Tweak. And he has wins on zackray, light, and Salem
1/25/20, 12:02 AM - Darren: Yes
1/25/20, 12:03 AM - Alex Starr: I guess MKLeo is a good sign?
1/25/20, 12:04 AM - Darren: Well, it would have been cool if he had beaten MKLeo
1/25/20, 12:06 AM - Alex Starr: Eh I more meant your brother and mkleo play lucina
1/25/20, 12:07 AM - Darren: Mr E mains Lucina so that would be a definite good sign
1/25/20, 12:11 AM - Alex Starr: True
1/25/20, 1:58 PM - Darren: Update: kiki lost to myran 1-2 and made it out of r1 pools
1/25/20, 2:00 PM - Vaughn: Oh shiiiiit
1/25/20, 2:01 PM - Vaughn: Took a game off him thats dope
1/25/20, 2:05 PM - Matt Casali: That's awesome
1/25/20, 2:05 PM - Ricky: Yooooo that’s sick!!!
1/25/20, 2:07 PM - Darren: Yeeeh
1/25/20, 2:58 PM - Alex Starr: Nice
1/26/20, 11:52 AM - Parker: holy shit Kobe...
1/26/20, 11:53 AM - Darren: Confirmed?
1/26/20, 11:53 AM - Parker: idk i think so it’s all over twitter
1/26/20, 11:53 AM - Parker: i’m tripping
1/26/20, 11:54 AM - Darren: I saw it on Twitter too
1/26/20, 11:55 AM - Darren: (For context, TMZ reported that Kobe died in a helicopter crash)
1/26/20, 12:04 PM - Parker: I’m really shook
1/26/20, 12:07 PM - Matt Casali: Holy shit
1/26/20, 12:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: What
1/26/20, 12:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: Holy shit
1/26/20, 12:31 PM - Ricky: Rip
1/26/20, 12:31 PM - Ricky: Darren, any Kiki updates?
1/26/20, 12:32 PM - Darren: Oh, he lost somewhere in round 2 pools (which is all the way up to top 64)
1/26/20, 12:32 PM - Darren: I think he got 256/1600
1/26/20, 12:33 PM - Darren: After losing to myran, he played against some non notable fox/chrom that goes to all the S tier events and places top 100 at them
1/26/20, 12:34 PM - Darren: So that's a bad loss, but it also makes sense since this is Kiki's first PGR event
1/26/20, 12:45 PM - Ricky: Yeah, damn that’s cray
1/26/20, 12:47 PM - Matt Casali: That's really cool and a really good placement for genesis
1/26/20, 1:34 PM - Darren: Yeah! Very proud of him
1/26/20, 1:35 PM - Darren: It amazes me how stacked Genesis is without any of the Japanese players attending
1/26/20, 10:23 PM - Ricky: yoooo MKleo got taken down
1/26/20, 10:23 PM - Darren: That was the closest 3-0 I've ever seen
1/26/20, 10:23 PM - Ricky: wild
1/26/20, 10:23 PM - Darren: Marss playing insane
1/26/20, 10:24 PM - Ricky: what a beast
1/26/20, 10:27 PM - Darren: Leo fucked up samsora too
1/26/20, 10:27 PM - Darren: He was playing hot
1/26/20, 10:30 PM - Ricky: damn, welp, better luck next time
1/26/20, 10:30 PM - Ricky: when he gotta face player 5 in grand finals
1/26/20, 10:32 PM - Darren: Although leo continuing his streak of always getting to grand finals
1/26/20, 10:32 PM - Darren: He literally only got 1st and 2nd at tournaments last season
1/26/20, 10:32 PM - Darren: If he ever comes to a local here
1/27/20, 9:07 PM - Ricky: PSA:

1/27/20, 10:19 PM - Parker: PSA: don’t read or look at any kobe shit, that shit hit different

1/27/20, 11:08 PM - Tim Ko: Damn that photoshopped photo lebron posted of him and kobe on the court with the lakers jerseys sent chills down my spine
1/28/20, 10:31 AM - Ricky: Edgar bought a Bentley?!!?
1/28/20, 10:31 AM - Jason Greenberg: Pick
1/28/20, 10:31 AM - Jason Greenberg: Pic
1/28/20, 10:31 AM - Parker: Pic
1/28/20, 10:32 AM - Ricky: His regular and his drug insta both have it in his insta story
1/28/20, 10:32 AM - Ricky: Maybe it’s a rental
1/28/20, 10:32 AM - Ricky: But he deff driving around a Bentley under his name
1/28/20, 10:33 AM - Parker: Damn
1/28/20, 10:33 AM - Parker: i think i unfollowed him lol
1/28/20, 10:34 AM - Jason Greenberg: Could be a rental
1/28/20, 10:35 AM - Jason Greenberg: Those things are 300k+
1/28/20, 10:38 AM - Ricky: Well he is also a drug kingpin
1/28/20, 10:38 AM - Ricky: He also appears to own a large home from his stories
1/28/20, 10:39 AM - Ricky: But that might be false as well haha
1/28/20, 10:42 AM - Jason Greenberg: I’d guess expensive rental for both
1/28/20, 10:43 AM - Jason Greenberg: That’s what Ty Lopez does when he flexes his cars. They’re all one day rentals
1/28/20, 10:49 AM - Ricky: Damn, yeah that’s make sense
1/28/20, 11:34 AM - Matt Casali: Glad Edgar's doing well for himself
1/29/20, 10:10 AM - Matt Casali: Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep was surprisingly good and I'd recommend it to y'all
1/29/20, 10:38 AM - Alex Starr: Show or book
1/29/20, 10:54 AM - Jason Greenberg: ^
1/29/20, 11:20 AM - Matt Casali: Book
1/29/20, 11:48 AM - Jason Greenberg: Nice
1/29/20, 4:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: https://abcnews.go.com/US/santa-cruz-decriminalizes-psychedelic-mushrooms/story?id=68611065
1/29/20, 4:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: Wow @santacruzboys
1/29/20, 4:37 PM - Matt Casali: Yet everyone in santa cruz _still_ wants to recall the council members?
1/29/20, 4:37 PM - Matt Casali: Jeez
1/29/20, 4:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: What's the deal there?
1/29/20, 4:38 PM - Alex Starr: Lack of mushrooms
1/29/20, 4:38 PM - Alex Starr: They’ve since resolved the issue
1/29/20, 4:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: So it seems
1/29/20, 4:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: Matt are you gonna go foraging for us?
1/29/20, 4:39 PM - Matt Casali: Hey maybe
1/29/20, 4:40 PM - Matt Casali: You know the foraging class is gonna have like a 500% increase on the waitlist
1/29/20, 4:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: It could be part of your thesis
1/29/20, 4:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: lol
1/29/20, 4:40 PM - Matt Casali: How do hummingbirds react to their nectar being replaced by mushrooms?
1/29/20, 4:40 PM - Alex Starr: Poorly
1/29/20, 4:40 PM - Alex Starr: Fun fact the Aztecs apparently sacrificed hummingbirds
1/29/20, 4:41 PM - Alex Starr: But now the question is did they give the hummingbirds hallucinogens first
1/29/20, 4:41 PM - Matt Casali: If there was any bird to sacrifice that would be it
1/29/20, 4:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: What is the soundscape of starting a Vice show about picking mushrooms for my friends
1/29/20, 4:43 PM - Alex Starr: Their main god was hummingbird related
1/29/20, 4:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: Interesting
1/29/20, 4:43 PM - Matt Casali: My comment works well here too
1/29/20, 7:48 PM - Parker: Lol
1/29/20, 7:48 PM - Parker: Pigeons
1/31/20, 12:12 AM - Tim Ko: If y’all ever wanna learn canto, here are the 6 supposedly “distinguishable” tones lmao
1/31/20, 12:12 AM - Tim Ko: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4dLV9QjhHME
1/31/20, 3:39 PM - Darren: Holy shit, I just took the single hardest test of my entire undergraduate career - and it was midterm 1 for my earth catastrophes GE
1/31/20, 3:40 PM - Alex Starr: Hahaha
1/31/20, 3:40 PM - Alex Starr: What was so hard? Memorization stuff?
1/31/20, 3:40 PM - Collin Hurst: tf haha
1/31/20, 3:44 PM - Darren: It was 100 questions multiple choice. Over half the questions used technical astrology terms / names that he may have mentioned once in lecture under his breath and they all sound the same so it's basically impossible to guess
1/31/20, 3:45 PM - Darren: There were 5 homework assignments for this class that were roughly 90 problems each. Only like 1/3 of the questions on this test were even remotely related to those questions
1/31/20, 3:46 PM - Collin Hurst: jesus
1/31/20, 3:46 PM - Collin Hurst: curved?
1/31/20, 3:46 PM - Darren: And some of the questions that overlapped now had technical terms the textbook didn't use, so you were fucked on those anyway
1/31/20, 3:47 PM - Darren: Extremely. Apparently last quarter a 50% was a C or C+
1/31/20, 3:52 PM - Darren: That test was a catastrophe
1/31/20, 3:59 PM - Vaughn: God class like that suck
1/31/20, 4:00 PM - Vaughn: These profs about the topic but take the class waaaay too seriously and make it way too hard
1/31/20, 4:00 PM - Vaughn: *care about
1/31/20, 4:00 PM - Collin Hurst: de anza for the win
1/31/20, 4:00 PM - Collin Hurst: de anza GE's *
1/31/20, 4:01 PM - Vaughn: Theres probably 1 student in your class of 100 that are a little close to maybe considering to care a little bit about something they learn in that class so it shouldnt be that hard gosh
1/31/20, 4:20 PM - Alex Starr: Nah probably 10+
1/31/20, 4:40 PM - Vaughn: Possibly haha
1/31/20, 6:17 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz I figure 8 have capitalized on the mushroom legalization
1/31/20, 8:18 PM - Vaughn: Lol
2/1/20, 12:25 AM - Parker: just ran into nolan at the bars lol
2/1/20, 12:25 AM - Parker: Made my night

2/1/20, 12:45 AM - Parker: Good lol
2/1/20, 12:45 AM - Parker: he called me beautiful and said have great night
2/1/20, 1:14 AM - Tim Ko: Haha
2/1/20, 11:58 AM - Tim Ko: Also back to the corona virus thing, I just realized my mentor (who is from wu han) said he was going back to China for a couple weeks when I saw him on jan 4th. And the news article said the infected man returned from China on Jan 24th after spending a couple weeks there...
2/1/20, 11:59 AM - Vaughn: Oh no...
2/1/20, 11:59 AM - Darren: God damn it Tim
2/1/20, 11:59 AM - Darren: You're a doctor
2/1/20, 11:59 AM - Darren: Fix this
2/1/20, 11:59 AM - Tim Ko: Lol
2/1/20, 11:59 AM - Tim Ko: I should probably send him a text to see if he’s ok
2/1/20, 4:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ayyy
2/1/20, 5:00 PM - Ricky: Damn, yeah, I was listening in on a conference call my mom was on today and it was with all the major hospitals in the area and they were discussing corona and what was the best way to execute the rules that the government was rolling out, seems like a pretty spooky threat atm
2/1/20, 5:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: Careful he might be contagious
2/1/20, 5:21 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
2/1/20, 5:21 PM - Tim Ko: Well he hasn’t responded
2/1/20, 5:21 PM - Tim Ko: I think he’s still in China
2/3/20, 10:56 AM - Parker: are any of you proficient in R?
2/3/20, 10:56 AM - Parker: i have a question
2/3/20, 10:56 AM - Vaughn: <Media omitted>
2/3/20, 10:57 AM - Jason Greenberg: Rick is
2/3/20, 10:58 AM - Jason Greenberg: Lol
2/3/20, 10:58 AM - Parker: Lol
2/3/20, 10:59 AM - Parker: so the question is "Compute minimum, mean, median, maximum and standard deviation for all the numeric
variables in the data by education variable" and its using this dataset where education is a variable and each person is either 'undergrad', 'graduate', or 'advanced' so it wants the summary of each category sperately
2/3/20, 10:59 AM - Parker: separately
2/3/20, 11:00 AM - Parker: I know how to count the total of each category but cant figure out how to summarize each one
2/3/20, 11:16 AM - Ricky: If you use the summarize() function it does all of those I’m pretty sure
2/3/20, 11:16 AM - Parker: No but that would summarize the whole dataset
2/3/20, 11:17 AM - Ricky: And if you use group_by() and for data$variable it shoulddddd group it by those
2/3/20, 11:17 AM - Parker: Which i already did bc that was 1A
2/3/20, 11:17 AM - Parker: ohhhh
2/3/20, 11:17 AM - Ricky: Use the pipe function
2/3/20, 11:17 AM - Ricky: To put it in there
2/3/20, 11:17 AM - Ricky: I thinkkkk that should work
2/3/20, 11:17 AM - Parker: Ok i try
2/3/20, 11:17 AM - Parker: thanks
2/3/20, 11:17 AM - Ricky: Do ?group_by and read what it says
2/3/20, 11:17 AM - Ricky: For the correct use of it
2/5/20, 3:49 PM - Parker: Damn collin getting BUCKETS in vaughn’s story
2/5/20, 5:17 PM - Vaughn: Lmao

2/6/20, 2:18 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah i would have liked to get 2 first round picks at least

2/6/20, 3:49 PM - Parker: Ehh yeah a little
2/6/20, 3:49 PM - Parker: but yeah he’ll fit well with steph and klay
2/6/20, 3:50 PM - Parker: and hopefully draymond doesn’t kill him

2/9/20, 5:46 PM - Matt Casali: That's so vague haha
2/9/20, 5:51 PM - Alex Starr: Apparently the guy I’m eating breakfast tomorrow with won a Nobel prize
2/9/20, 5:58 PM - Darren: Do you know what for?
2/9/20, 6:01 PM - Alex Starr: I didn’t til today.  He discovered splicing, which is that every gene in animals/plants has introns which get cut out of RNA before RNA is translated to protein
2/9/20, 6:02 PM - Jason Greenberg: Damn
2/9/20, 6:03 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah someone told me luckily
2/9/20, 6:03 PM - Alex Starr: Otherwise I’d have awkwardly asked what do you do?
2/9/20, 6:06 PM - Alex Starr: Which would be the scientific equivalent of asking Larry bird what he does
2/9/20, 6:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: No one would make that mistake
2/9/20, 6:09 PM - Alex Starr: No basketball fan would
2/9/20, 6:12 PM - Parker: Lol
2/9/20, 6:13 PM - Alex Starr: Had to pick something domain specific and with the widest reach.  And I don’t know soccer
2/9/20, 6:18 PM - Parker: No it was a good analogy haha
2/9/20, 6:18 PM - Parker: that’s sick though alex
2/9/20, 6:18 PM - Parker: Is it like a group or just you and him?
2/9/20, 6:19 PM - Tim Ko: That’s dope
2/9/20, 6:19 PM - Alex Starr: Like 6 plus him
2/9/20, 6:20 PM - Alex Starr: He’s retiring soon though
2/9/20, 6:21 PM - Tim Ko: How are u liking MIT?
2/9/20, 6:22 PM - Alex Starr: It’s awesome
2/9/20, 6:22 PM - Alex Starr: Up there with caltech
2/9/20, 6:22 PM - Alex Starr: I also learned that Stanford’s interviews are super competitive and a lot of people didn’t like it for various reasons
2/9/20, 6:24 PM - Tim Ko: That’s great! My dad got excited when I told him u we’re at MIT interviewing haha (my parents came up yesterday)
2/9/20, 6:24 PM - Tim Ko: Oh dang that’s interesting, seems very un Stanford like
2/9/20, 6:24 PM - Alex Starr: Oh lol.  I’ll talk with him about it when I see him
2/9/20, 6:25 PM - Alex Starr: Right?  It’s what I’d expect from caltech or mit or Harvard but Stanford is typically chill
2/9/20, 6:25 PM - Alex Starr: I’ve also heard they very much deemphasize classes which I dislike
2/9/20, 6:26 PM - Tim Ko: Hm that’s interesting
2/9/20, 6:26 PM - Darren: Like they don't care what classes you've taken?
2/9/20, 6:26 PM - Darren: Or you don't take as many classes when at Stanford grad
2/9/20, 6:26 PM - Alex Starr: No they don’t put much effort into grad classes
2/9/20, 6:27 PM - Alex Starr: And really don’t want you to take many
2/9/20, 6:27 PM - Alex Starr: Whereas MIT/caltech encourage it to varying degrees
2/9/20, 6:27 PM - Alex Starr: MIT is all classes the thirst semester
2/9/20, 6:27 PM - Alex Starr: First
2/9/20, 6:28 PM - Alex Starr: Which also goes a huge way toward social stuff which is damn high on my list of concerns
2/9/20, 6:28 PM - Darren: Your PhD thesis should be how to train a neural net to be your friend
2/9/20, 6:29 PM - Alex Starr: Not a proportional response
2/9/20, 6:29 PM - Darren: Either an existing one already in a human or an entirely synthetic one
2/9/20, 6:29 PM - Alex Starr: It’d be dope tho
2/9/20, 6:29 PM - Darren: Sorry it's the sickness
2/9/20, 6:29 PM - Alex Starr: It’s fine
2/9/20, 6:30 PM - Alex Starr: Training a mouse to be friends with another mouse by manipulating its neurons directly would be dope
2/9/20, 6:31 PM - Alex Starr: Random aside, if a goose sees you first thing it will be absolutely convinced you’re it’s mom
2/9/20, 6:31 PM - Darren: If you leave a baby goose in darkness for a year while still keeping it alive, does the first sight mom thing still stand?
2/9/20, 6:32 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t think so
2/9/20, 6:32 PM - Alex Starr: You miss what’s called the critical period when the connections in the brain are changeable enough
2/9/20, 6:32 PM - Darren: Can 2 baby geese look at each other and both become single moms?
2/9/20, 6:33 PM - Alex Starr: That might work
2/9/20, 6:33 PM - Alex Starr: You could almost certainly do it with a baby pig or dog
2/9/20, 6:33 PM - Parker: Lol
2/9/20, 6:34 PM - Darren: Stanford is surely good for other types of social activities tho
2/9/20, 6:35 PM - Alex Starr: Yes it’s not nearly as much of a concern there
2/9/20, 6:35 PM - Alex Starr: Social was just a major knock against mit
2/9/20, 6:35 PM - Alex Starr: I really won’t know until I interview
2/9/20, 8:18 PM - Tim Ko: U should meet up with Colton while ur there!
2/9/20, 8:45 PM - Parker: ^
2/10/20, 9:22 AM - Alex Starr: There was a sign up about how mental health is a big issue for mit biology grad students.  It was taken down so fast
2/10/20, 10:12 AM - Darren: Don't mind the red flags
2/10/20, 11:07 AM - Tim Ko: On average couldn’t be worse then Berkeley probably
2/10/20, 11:37 AM - Alex Starr: Goes without saying haha
2/10/20, 1:37 PM - Parker: Jason our women’s club lax team plays at ucsb this weekend you should go watch them
2/10/20, 1:37 PM - Parker: A few of them are in akpsi
2/10/20, 1:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: If you were on the team I would def watch
2/11/20, 6:54 PM - Darren: https://www.mvhsoracle.com/2020/02/11/grissom-announces-resignation-as-principal/
2/11/20, 6:54 PM - Darren: Grissom is resigning from MVHS in order to become CCS commissioner
2/11/20, 7:03 PM - Parker: Damn

2/13/20, 6:51 PM - Tim Ko: It’s not a bad look honestly, just gotta cut the sides a lot
2/13/20, 6:52 PM - Vaughn: It makes my head look huge lol
2/13/20, 6:52 PM - Vaughn: Thanks tim maybe ill bring ot back
2/13/20, 6:53 PM - Tim Ko: Haha yeah it’s just the sides, I think the top spiked up is a good look
2/13/20, 6:55 PM - Darren: You look so different what the heck
2/13/20, 6:55 PM - Collin Hurst: Tiny neck
2/13/20, 7:03 PM - Matt Casali: Who looks the most similar at senior year that's the question
2/13/20, 7:06 PM - Vaughn: Yeah thinner face and less neck muscle
2/13/20, 7:09 PM - Darren: Alex starr

2/13/20, 8:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah your jaw actually has gotten dangerous
2/13/20, 8:02 PM - Jason Greenberg: You should offer to chew girls’ food for them with your superior jaw genes
2/13/20, 9:46 PM - Parker: Lol
2/14/20, 1:41 PM - Vaughn: <Media omitted>
2/14/20, 1:42 PM - Vaughn: I just found out this is a thing. I remember talkin to collin a while back about the concept and its so fucking cool

2/14/20, 1:47 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah says the man who’s phone has never at any point been charged
2/14/20, 1:50 PM - Vaughn: Looool yeah i was gunna test the feature but it turns out you need to be above 15% to share power
2/14/20, 2:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: <Media omitted>

2/15/20, 7:27 PM - Alex Starr: Is it because it’s in Colorado?
2/15/20, 7:28 PM - Collin Hurst: Maybe subconsciously
2/15/20, 7:52 PM - Tim Ko: Now is def more appropriate to discuss this stuff then on the week he died
2/15/20, 7:53 PM - Tim Ko: Might still be too soon for many ppl tho
2/15/20, 8:05 PM - Alex Starr: It’s never too soon to shit on the dead

2/16/20, 11:38 AM - Parker: They’re under so much heat rn
2/16/20, 11:38 AM - Parker: Other players are ripping them apart

2/16/20, 11:40 AM - Parker: can’t buy yourself to a ring
2/16/20, 11:40 AM - Parker: But they can have all the division titles they want lol
2/16/20, 11:49 AM - Ricky: Ahha idk, It’s worked pretty well for the yanks in the past
2/16/20, 11:51 AM - Parker: I mean sure but that was also a lot different back then
2/16/20, 11:51 AM - Parker: Like i don’t see this dodgers team winning a ring
2/16/20, 11:56 AM - Ricky: Oh I meant this yanks team haha
2/16/20, 11:57 AM - Ricky: Haha yeah the dodgers are a threat but also they gonna win their division regardless, got weak ass opponents

2/16/20, 12:17 PM - Ricky: Ohhh gotcha, I just meant as a frenchise they’ve deff paid for the ring (arod acquisition sticks out)
2/16/20, 12:18 PM - Parker: Yeah true but i feel like it was a couple top players back then with him and jeter but now it’s like their whole outfield and 3-4 of their starting pitchers
2/16/20, 12:18 PM - Parker: that they paid a hefty price for
2/16/20, 12:19 PM - Parker: but yeah as a franchise it’s definitely worked for them haha
2/16/20, 6:03 PM - Collin Hurst: Today during my game one of our strikers broke his collarbone, then while we were waiting for the ambulance someone tried to toss a full 32 oz hydro to someone on the field and hit our backup goalie in the head, giving him a concussion and a nasty sore
2/16/20, 6:06 PM - Tim Ko: Holy dude
2/16/20, 6:07 PM - Tim Ko: Thought u were gonna say the hydro flask hit the striker on his collarbone

2/24/20, 2:44 PM - Parker: That’s sick rick
2/24/20, 2:44 PM - Parker: my first thought
2/24/20, 2:44 PM - Parker: and the clear skies
2/24/20, 2:44 PM - Parker: imagine that
2/24/20, 3:03 PM - Tim Ko: That’s sick ricky!!
2/24/20, 3:03 PM - Tim Ko: Budding gymnast
2/26/20, 12:25 PM - Vaughn: <Media omitted>
2/26/20, 12:26 PM - Ricky: You got it boiiiiii!!!!!
2/26/20, 12:26 PM - Ricky: Looking good!
2/26/20, 12:27 PM - Vaughn: Wrists hurt haha, i gotta try the towel
2/26/20, 12:27 PM - Ricky: Just get that plant both feet same time and just send it!
2/26/20, 12:27 PM - Ricky: Yeah, use some supports haha
2/26/20, 12:27 PM - Ricky: Also, practice just the backflip a few times
2/26/20, 12:27 PM - Ricky: Mine was mega rusty
2/26/20, 12:27 PM - Parker: Danggg so close
2/26/20, 12:27 PM - Vaughn: Saaamme my first backflip in a while was skeeetch
2/26/20, 12:28 PM - Darren: My knees hurt just watching that
2/26/20, 12:29 PM - Vaughn: <Media omitted>
2/26/20, 12:31 PM - Ricky: Haha damn, yeah, we gotta get more practice in!
2/26/20, 12:31 PM - Vaughn: Yes please
2/26/20, 12:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: Damn you’re close
2/26/20, 1:05 PM - Vaughn: Whooooa there was no chat yesterday, thats only happened like 3 times!
2/26/20, 1:05 PM - Parker: I realized that earlier too!
2/26/20, 1:06 PM - Alex Starr: Damn I usually work to prevent that but was exhasuted.  Berkeley is convinced that drinking til midnight followed by mandatory interview activities at 8:00 is a great idea
2/26/20, 1:07 PM - Ricky: Hahaha, did you drink till midnight?
2/26/20, 1:07 PM - Parker: You were  drinking til midnight? lol
2/26/20, 1:07 PM - Alex Starr: Did two days ago.  Then had interview stuff most of yesterday
2/26/20, 1:08 PM - Alex Starr: And have been doing interview for five days straight so am wildly behind on hw
2/26/20, 1:08 PM - Alex Starr: One of the questions was "redo the whole midterm".  I did not take the midterm.
2/26/20, 1:08 PM - Parker: Lol shit
2/26/20, 1:08 PM - Parker: Grad interviews?
2/26/20, 1:08 PM - Ricky: Lol
2/26/20, 1:08 PM - Ricky: Wait what were you drinking for/ who with?
2/26/20, 1:10 PM - Alex Starr: Every interview has taken us to bars for free drinks at least twice
2/26/20, 1:10 PM - Alex Starr: yeah had ucsf and berkeley
2/26/20, 1:10 PM - Alex Starr: Last one is stanford March 5th
2/26/20, 1:10 PM - Tim Ko: That’s dope
2/26/20, 1:10 PM - Parker: Dang that’s sick haha
2/26/20, 1:11 PM - Parker: how’d they go?
2/26/20, 1:11 PM - Tim Ko: U shoulda gotten absolutely hammered for the Berkeley one
2/26/20, 1:14 PM - Ricky: Hahaha
2/26/20, 1:14 PM - Ricky: I second that
2/26/20, 1:14 PM - Alex Starr: Idk.  Find out about ucsf today probably and Berkeley Friday.  Wasn't a huge fan of UCSF but really liked berkeley
2/26/20, 1:18 PM - Ricky: I bet you could be on a list for longest consecutive education at Berkeley if you went all the way there
2/26/20, 1:18 PM - Alex Starr: Probably not haha
2/26/20, 1:18 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah I feel like not
2/26/20, 1:19 PM - Matt Casali: It's a long time, but def not uncommon
2/26/20, 1:19 PM - Ricky: I mean, how could you go for longer?
2/26/20, 1:19 PM - Alex Starr: Be a professor here
2/26/20, 1:19 PM - Alex Starr: which someone did
2/26/20, 1:19 PM - Ricky: Ehhhhh that’s cheating
2/26/20, 1:19 PM - Alex Starr: they did undergrad, six years of grad, post doc elsewhere, then professor for 12 years now here
2/26/20, 1:19 PM - Ricky: Go for longest consecutive 4.0
2/26/20, 1:20 PM - Ricky: That must be a tighter list
2/26/20, 1:25 PM - Alex Starr: You right
2/26/20, 1:25 PM - Alex Starr: Though the 4.0 is likely out of reach this semester
2/26/20, 1:25 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz I don't want to work that hard
2/26/20, 1:30 PM - Parker: Damn
2/26/20, 1:30 PM - Parker: first time ever?
2/26/20, 1:30 PM - Alex Starr: We will see
2/26/20, 1:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: Wow I ofc starred this
2/26/20, 1:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: Only for the shock value
2/26/20, 1:57 PM - Vaughn: I was shooketh

2/26/20, 6:42 PM - Collin Hurst: 264915
2/26/20, 6:42 PM - Collin Hurst: you didn't say 3 haha
2/26/20, 6:42 PM - Tim Ko: Damn haha
2/26/20, 6:42 PM - Tim Ko: Oh my b lol
2/26/20, 6:43 PM - Collin Hurst: oh well lost your chance
2/26/20, 6:43 PM - Tim Ko: Anyways let’s all go to an A’s game
2/26/20, 6:43 PM - Tim Ko: Remember how fun last year was
2/26/20, 6:43 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah I doubt that will happen again haha
2/26/20, 6:43 PM - Collin Hurst: but yeah im down
2/26/20, 6:44 PM - Vaughn: That was insane i will never forget that moment
2/26/20, 6:45 PM - Tim Ko: Ikr, us group hugging and jumping up and down for 30 seconds on the 3rd deck
2/26/20, 7:02 PM - Parker: :(
2/26/20, 7:03 PM - Collin Hurst: and the soggy chicken tenders with the sauce flight
2/26/20, 7:04 PM - Tim Ko: Lmao
2/26/20, 7:04 PM - Tim Ko: The huge frozen bag from Walmart
2/26/20, 7:04 PM - Vaughn: Those soggy chicken tenders were so clutch
2/26/20, 7:04 PM - Tim Ko: They were so disgusting on the outside tho lol
2/27/20, 8:49 AM - Ricky: Ayyyyy, yes we 100% going Tim
2/27/20, 11:37 AM - Darren: @16502793171 is faker the best LoL player in the world?
2/27/20, 11:37 AM - Darren: His team T1 just picked up MKLeo
2/27/20, 12:49 PM - Ricky: At the moment? Debatable but fanbase+skill over last 5 years, undoubtedly
2/27/20, 12:49 PM - Ricky: In Korea he is a god
2/27/20, 12:49 PM - Ricky: That’s a beastly pickup
2/27/20, 12:50 PM - Ricky: Rip ekko fox
2/27/20, 12:50 PM - Ricky: Watching rick fox’s interviews about it is pretty sad cuz he got into esports for his son and racist rich dudes took his shit over and ran it into the ground
2/27/20, 12:59 PM - Darren: Yeah rip echofox
2/27/20, 12:59 PM - Darren: But tbh I really was pulling for C9 MKLeo
2/27/20, 1:19 PM - Ricky: True, mango, MKLeo.
Also, you prob don’t care much but their league team is undefeated and absolutely dominant, like cool to watch but I’m a tsm fan so not super super fun
2/27/20, 1:20 PM - Ricky: Did you see prodigy clap MKLeo?
2/27/20, 1:24 PM - Darren: Who are the big teams for league?
2/27/20, 1:24 PM - Darren: Leo got fuuuuuuucked up
2/27/20, 1:25 PM - Darren: Frostbite was insane
2/27/20, 2:30 PM - Collin Hurst: Earth has a new moon woohoo
2/27/20, 2:31 PM - Darren: Isn't it so small we didn't notice it was there for a while
2/27/20, 2:31 PM - Collin Hurst: Idk how thats different than all the space junk we have in orbit but whats
2/27/20, 2:31 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah it's like car sized
2/27/20, 2:31 PM - Darren: That's no moon
2/27/20, 2:34 PM - Collin Hurst: Don't we have other space rocks in our orbit tho!
2/27/20, 2:34 PM - Collin Hurst: ?
2/27/20, 2:53 PM - Matt Casali: Probably and they're all small as fuck
2/27/20, 3:45 PM - Tim Ko: Just curious, in tech, do employees usually get stock options as part of their compensation every year or so? So like if ur company does better, u get compensated “more” even tho u salary is fixed?
2/27/20, 5:24 PM - Alex Starr: Often
2/27/20, 5:25 PM - Alex Starr: Wait is T1 SK telecom?
2/27/20, 5:25 PM - Darren: Yes
2/27/20, 5:32 PM - Alex Starr: Oh shit

2/28/20, 2:18 AM - Darren: Keep it up Parker
2/28/20, 11:45 AM - Collin Hurst: HAppy birthday matt!
2/28/20, 11:55 AM - Vaughn: HAPPY BIRTHDAY MATT!!
2/28/20, 11:55 AM - Tim Ko: Ayyy hbd Matt!!
2/28/20, 12:04 PM - Parker: Happy birthday matt!!

2/28/20, 12:50 PM - Parker: do you have plans for today matty boy
2/28/20, 12:51 PM - Matt Casali: I do indeed, though I haven't been told what they all are yet
2/28/20, 12:51 PM - Parker: Oooeee
2/28/20, 12:54 PM - Darren: 👀
2/28/20, 12:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: Matty!! Happy 22 my guy!
2/28/20, 12:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: 22 secret shots in your future!
2/28/20, 12:59 PM - Matt Casali: :/
2/28/20, 1:02 PM - Tim Ko: We should all play Minecraft for ur b day tonight matt!
2/28/20, 1:02 PM - Matt Casali: Haha maybe not tonight but maybe this weekend actually!
2/28/20, 1:35 PM - Alex Starr: Happy Birthday Matt!
2/28/20, 1:51 PM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
2/28/20, 1:57 PM - Alex Starr: I’d rather just go to Krispy Kreme haha but down
2/29/20, 11:48 AM - Tim Ko: Damn they fired the ucsc grad students
2/29/20, 11:49 AM - Tim Ko: Are they now just grad students with no TA position? Or are they gone for good
2/29/20, 12:01 PM - Darren: Grad students with no TA position
2/29/20, 12:22 PM - Tim Ko: I see
2/29/20, 12:23 PM - Tim Ko: So now they basically have to pay for themselves living and food expenses
2/29/20, 12:28 PM - Tim Ko: Website says average grad student makes 21k a year. Living in a double is at most 1k a month, food for the year would be 2k at the most. Seems to me like 21k a year is livable for a college student
2/29/20, 12:33 PM - Darren: It is enough to live if you don't have 

1) an urgent, non-typical reason for spending money like medical stuff 

2) dependants

3) expensive taste

4) a desire to build any amount of wealth

5) an unwillingness to room with other people
2/29/20, 1:08 PM - Alex Starr: 6) Get lucky with housing
2/29/20, 1:09 PM - Alex Starr: And idk if grad students make that much if they aren’t TAing
2/29/20, 1:09 PM - Alex Starr: And also when you’re as economically valuable as say a 3rd year PhD student, livable can feel insulting
2/29/20, 1:21 PM - Darren: Research and TAing are different cases imo
2/29/20, 1:22 PM - Darren: ^
2/29/20, 1:28 PM - Alex Starr: What’s also interesting is that you could argue that stem PhDs are way more drastically underpaid even tho they are usually making in the 35-40 K range
2/29/20, 1:29 PM - Alex Starr: While they are pretty useless in years 1 and 2, years 3-4 and especially 5-6 it’s hard to think of a more valuable person for what they are paid
2/29/20, 1:49 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah but arent u still learning, at least in years 1-2. I can see how in years 3-4 it makes sense to pay them more since u provide legit value. But I see it as ur still being taught and so it’s kinda like undergrad
2/29/20, 1:50 PM - Alex Starr: While you are still being taught, you almost always aren’t taking classes or anything along those lines
2/29/20, 1:53 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah true, I think phd as furthering ur education rather than something u do to make a living. So while u are furthering ur education and not actually working for a living, i think as long as u have ur basic needs met, seems sufficient to me
2/29/20, 1:54 PM - Tim Ko: And as an undergrad, I’m pretty sure my parents spend less than 21k a year on me for living, food, and other expenses (not including tuition)
2/29/20, 1:54 PM - Alex Starr: But again as an undergrad you do approximately jack shit economically or for society.
2/29/20, 1:55 PM - Tim Ko: Yes, and so I think as phd u def should get paid for the value u provide
2/29/20, 1:55 PM - Alex Starr: And yes a PhD is training but by that 4th year (which is typically the halfway point) you aren’t being trained and are extremely valuable
2/29/20, 1:55 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah I totally agree
2/29/20, 1:56 PM - Tim Ko: But it seems like these grad students are arguing for a higher standard of living that from my estimate, is substantially higher than an average undergrad
2/29/20, 2:20 PM - Darren: Alex has an obvious PhD bias
2/29/20, 2:59 PM - Alex Starr: It should be higher than an average undergrad
2/29/20, 3:19 PM - Tim Ko: I think the biggest cost factor here is single vs double
2/29/20, 3:19 PM - Tim Ko: Cuz a double cuts ur rent in half
2/29/20, 3:22 PM - Alex Starr: People should not have to live with a roommate after undergrad
2/29/20, 3:22 PM - Alex Starr: Apartment mate sure
2/29/20, 4:09 PM - Tim Ko: Nah that should only be for when u have a full time job
2/29/20, 4:11 PM - Alex Starr: Strongly disagree and PhDs work 50-80 hours a week
2/29/20, 4:11 PM - Alex Starr: Hard to be more full time than that
2/29/20, 5:03 PM - Tim Ko: Even in years 1-2?
2/29/20, 5:04 PM - Alex Starr: Yes
2/29/20, 5:05 PM - Alex Starr: There’s a reason like a third of them are depressed and it’s not just wages
2/29/20, 5:13 PM - Darren: Having roommates does not cause depression
2/29/20, 5:15 PM - Alex Starr: Not what I’m saying, but also not sure I agree
2/29/20, 5:15 PM - Darren: Being roommates with Tim definitely might, I'll give you that
2/29/20, 5:16 PM - Tim Ko: Hmm ok I guess phD is similar to residency for med
2/29/20, 5:17 PM - Tim Ko: And residence def get paid enough to have their own room
2/29/20, 5:18 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
3/1/20, 11:27 AM - Alex Starr: I’m voting for Biden
3/1/20, 11:27 AM - Alex Starr: Have to prevent a sanders win
3/1/20, 11:36 AM - Parker: Out of biden warren and sanders who do you think has the best chance to beat trump
3/1/20, 11:36 AM - Alex Starr: Biden
3/1/20, 11:36 AM - Alex Starr: I don’t think warren can beat sanders
3/1/20, 11:36 AM - Alex Starr: And sanders’ plans are iffy af
3/1/20, 11:43 AM - Parker: really?
3/1/20, 11:43 AM - Parker: i watched a couple debates awhile back and he sucked ass
3/1/20, 11:43 AM - Parker: But i haven’t followed much since
3/1/20, 11:44 AM - Alex Starr: Might’ve sucked but not sure how much it matters
3/1/20, 11:45 AM - Matt Casali: Sanders
3/1/20, 11:45 AM - Matt Casali: They're both populists
3/1/20, 11:48 AM - Matt Casali: Like had strokes on-stage haha
3/1/20, 11:57 AM - Parker: Literally
3/1/20, 11:57 AM - Parker: it was kinda sad and concerning
3/1/20, 11:57 AM - Parker: you could tell how old he’s getting
3/1/20, 12:03 PM - Matt Casali: I know
3/1/20, 12:04 PM - Matt Casali: I mean it's the same with a lot of politicians
3/1/20, 12:04 PM - Matt Casali: The blood in Sanders' eyes during the debate
3/1/20, 12:06 PM - Darren: It's his fighting spirit
3/1/20, 12:11 PM - Alex Starr: He’s too easily branded a socialist
3/1/20, 12:11 PM - Alex Starr: And is socialist, badly
3/1/20, 12:17 PM - Matt Casali: Hm
3/1/20, 12:19 PM - Parker: true
3/1/20, 12:54 PM - Tim Ko: I’m all for a little more socialism
3/1/20, 12:55 PM - Tim Ko: Tho most of the American ppl are prob not
3/1/20, 1:11 PM - Matt Casali: Idk, I think a lot are
3/1/20, 1:12 PM - Matt Casali: But not a very large majority of trump supporters
3/1/20, 1:12 PM - Matt Casali: But if they didnt vote for Clinton over trump I'm not sure theres much to sway there
3/1/20, 1:15 PM - Matt Casali: /I got a table outside
3/1/20, 1:18 PM - Matt Casali: Wrong chat
3/1/20, 1:26 PM - Tim Ko: Idk I think gender prob had a lot to do with that, plus the whole crooked Hillary propaganda
3/1/20, 1:26 PM - Tim Ko: And doesn’t Biden have that plagerism scandal in the past, could be used against him
3/1/20, 1:32 PM - Darren: <Media omitted>
3/1/20, 1:35 PM - Matt Casali: You're right
3/1/20, 1:35 PM - Matt Casali: And they all have dirt
3/1/20, 1:36 PM - Matt Casali: Some more than others for sure
3/1/20, 1:40 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah for sure
3/1/20, 1:40 PM - Alex Starr: Socialism the way Bernie is describing doesn’t exist
3/1/20, 1:41 PM - Alex Starr: It would mean much higher taxes on the poor and middle class and upper middle class
3/1/20, 1:44 PM - Matt Casali: What do you mean?
3/1/20, 1:45 PM - Tim Ko: Higher taxes on the poor?
3/1/20, 1:46 PM - Tim Ko: He’s not taxing the upper class?
3/1/20, 1:47 PM - Alex Starr: That’s how Nordic countries work
3/1/20, 1:48 PM - Alex Starr: 55.9% tax rate on all earning > 1.3x the national average (65K for the us)
3/1/20, 1:48 PM - Alex Starr: They have more billionaires per capita too
3/1/20, 1:48 PM - Matt Casali: But hes not just copying nordic countries
3/1/20, 1:48 PM - Alex Starr: And a 25% sales tax by and large
3/1/20, 1:48 PM - Alex Starr: You’re right
3/1/20, 1:49 PM - Alex Starr: But there is no analog for what he wants, no test case country
3/1/20, 1:49 PM - Matt Casali: Ok
3/1/20, 1:49 PM - Matt Casali: Sounds better than where we're at rn
3/1/20, 1:49 PM - Alex Starr: Does it tho?
3/1/20, 1:49 PM - Matt Casali: Haha yes
3/1/20, 1:50 PM - Alex Starr: I mean obviously better than trump
3/1/20, 1:50 PM - Alex Starr: But better than if Hillary won?
3/1/20, 1:50 PM - Matt Casali: Yes
3/1/20, 1:50 PM - Alex Starr: Explain
3/1/20, 1:50 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t see how his system will work
3/1/20, 1:50 PM - Matt Casali: Well because we differ on how we view people fundamentally I think
3/1/20, 1:50 PM - Matt Casali: And that's very hard to change
3/1/20, 1:50 PM - Matt Casali: You view them as inherently selfish and I dont
3/1/20, 1:51 PM - Alex Starr: I’m not sure how much it changes the economics of his plan
3/1/20, 1:51 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t view them as inherently selfish necessarily
3/1/20, 1:51 PM - Alex Starr: Contrary to what I may have said
3/1/20, 1:51 PM - Matt Casali: Ohh okay
3/1/20, 1:52 PM - Matt Casali: Well then I think Bernie is an experimental phase into what transition to a more socialist economy could look like
3/1/20, 1:52 PM - Alex Starr: I’m more just asking:
What is his plan?
How is it viable economically?
What is so bad about the status quo that his plan will specifically address?
Why should I vote for someone so focused on inequality when climate changes is knocking?
3/1/20, 1:53 PM - Matt Casali: Well inequality and climate change are linked
3/1/20, 1:53 PM - Matt Casali: You cant fix one without the other
3/1/20, 1:53 PM - Tim Ko: Wait can someone explain to me why the upper class isn’t the most taxed? Is it cuz we want them investing in things?
3/1/20, 1:53 PM - Alex Starr: I’ve never heard that before.  Yes linked but I think you can fix climate without fixing inequality
3/1/20, 1:54 PM - Alex Starr: They are the most taxed
3/1/20, 1:54 PM - Matt Casali: You can fix it temporarily yes
3/1/20, 1:54 PM - Alex Starr: By far
3/1/20, 1:54 PM - Alex Starr: I’d say pretty permanently with some effective carbon capture and new tech
3/1/20, 1:55 PM - Matt Casali: But why are we concerned about climate change? It wont effect the global north for quite some time and the ways in which it will, will disproportionately effect marginalized communities
3/1/20, 1:55 PM - Tim Ko: Oh so is bernies plan to increase their taxes less than the middle class?
3/1/20, 1:56 PM - Alex Starr: No he wants massive increases on the upper class
3/1/20, 1:56 PM - Alex Starr: I’m just saying that kind of thing has gone badly in the past.
3/1/20, 1:56 PM - Alex Starr: That isn’t why I’m concerned as much
3/1/20, 1:56 PM - Alex Starr: Which I agree is a fundamental difference Matt
3/1/20, 1:57 PM - Alex Starr: But not one that should preclude conversation
3/1/20, 1:57 PM - Tim Ko: Oh for sure
3/1/20, 1:57 PM - Tim Ko: Really? When and what happened in the past?
3/1/20, 1:57 PM - Alex Starr: I’m not 100% clear on the specifics of his plan tbh
3/1/20, 1:58 PM - Alex Starr: The Nordic countries tried pretty aggressive specialism in the past (60s-80s) and it did not work.
3/1/20, 1:58 PM - Alex Starr: One thing I will say Matt is that I’m a big fan of UBI and moving away from a focus on growth and more of a focus on sustainability
3/1/20, 1:58 PM - Tim Ko: I see
3/1/20, 2:14 PM - Matt Casali: Same here
3/1/20, 2:15 PM - Matt Casali: I watched the kurzgesagt video on ubi but didnt fully grasp but I should watch again
3/1/20, 2:47 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’m sad about Yang
3/1/20, 2:47 PM - Jason Greenberg: He was a moderate who could’ve sway with republicans
3/1/20, 2:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: Also Matt I’m surprised about your stance climate change
3/1/20, 2:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: stance on*
3/1/20, 3:16 PM - Alex Starr: Same
3/1/20, 3:16 PM - Alex Starr: On the climate front
3/1/20, 3:16 PM - Alex Starr: Didn’t have much faith in a yang victory
3/1/20, 3:20 PM - Matt Casali: How has it changed?
3/1/20, 3:25 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t think it’s changed necessarily, more we didn’t think that would be your underlying motivation.
3/1/20, 3:25 PM - Alex Starr: I figured it was the whole mass death thing
3/1/20, 3:26 PM - Alex Starr: You phrased it as ultimately an exacerbation of inequality and insufficient aid for minorities
3/1/20, 3:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah that’s what surprised me
3/1/20, 3:54 PM - Alex Starr: For me, it’s such a big deal cuz it’s basically the only thing that could make things significantly worse than they are now.  And not only does it make things worse, it does so across the board.
3/1/20, 4:03 PM - Matt Casali: I totally agree
3/1/20, 4:03 PM - Matt Casali: But I think a lot of climate change action I see from a lot of candidates focuses more on surface level fixes that largely ignore inequalities
3/1/20, 4:14 PM - Alex Starr: In my mind getting something done is more important than dealing with the inequality aspect
3/1/20, 4:14 PM - Darren: From my point of view, the Jedi are evil!
3/1/20, 4:14 PM - Matt Casali: I get that
3/1/20, 4:14 PM - Matt Casali: And that
3/1/20, 4:16 PM - Matt Casali: And theres nothing wrong with trying to come up with solutions that dont address every single problem that has caused climate change and addressing those slowly
3/1/20, 4:17 PM - Matt Casali: I think the worry is that #1 a lot of technological fixes ignore minorities or harm them
3/1/20, 4:18 PM - Tim Ko: ^yeah this is very true
3/1/20, 4:19 PM - Matt Casali: #2 theres a lot of worry that climate change will be abated temporarily but the problems will still be there
3/1/20, 4:19 PM - Jason Greenberg: Example?
3/1/20, 4:21 PM - Alex Starr: I can live with that
3/1/20, 4:21 PM - Tim Ko: Any new expensive medical technology
3/1/20, 4:21 PM - Alex Starr: I can also live with that
3/1/20, 4:21 PM - Alex Starr: Time buying would be huge
3/1/20, 4:21 PM - Alex Starr: I’m way more worried with doing something and avoid runaway warming
3/1/20, 4:22 PM - Tim Ko: Even something as simple as tele medicine
3/1/20, 4:22 PM - Alex Starr: I mean that’s not climate related haha
3/1/20, 4:22 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah true lol but it applies
3/1/20, 4:23 PM - Tim Ko: U might end up with bigger disparities since the shittier areas don’t improve
3/1/20, 4:23 PM - Alex Starr: I’m interested in helping the underprivileged insofar as it is the most productive way to do the most net good
3/1/20, 4:23 PM - Matt Casali: Classic
3/1/20, 4:23 PM - Tim Ko: Fair enough
3/1/20, 4:23 PM - Alex Starr: Fairness shouldn’t be a concern.
3/1/20, 4:23 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah an example I would give is sustainable housing in already gentrified cities
3/1/20, 4:23 PM - Alex Starr: Is that climate related? I honestly don’t know
3/1/20, 4:24 PM - Alex Starr: Do you understand what I meant by this?
3/1/20, 4:24 PM - Alex Starr: It may not have been well stated on my end
3/1/20, 4:24 PM - Parker: Ok upper middle class white boy
3/1/20, 4:25 PM - Matt Casali: Yes. Utilitarianism
3/1/20, 4:25 PM - Matt Casali: Haha
3/1/20, 4:25 PM - Alex Starr: Hard maybe on the utilitarianism front
3/1/20, 4:25 PM - Alex Starr: Not 100% sure what it means
3/1/20, 4:25 PM - Tim Ko: Ur saying that if helping the privilege doesn’t do net good, ur not for it
3/1/20, 4:26 PM - Tim Ko: Like if it makes the rest of the population suffer
3/1/20, 4:26 PM - Alex Starr: No I’m more going for (to use a medical example) if I can develop tech but it will only help keep rich people alive, I’m all for it if the other option is no tech at all
3/1/20, 4:26 PM - Matt Casali: And net good is such a subjective thing
3/1/20, 4:27 PM - Matt Casali: Could be interpreted many ways
3/1/20, 4:27 PM - Tim Ko: Got it
3/1/20, 4:27 PM - Matt Casali: Why not work harder to develop a solution (maybe not tech) that will keep everyone alive?
3/1/20, 4:28 PM - Matt Casali: I mean I'm not sure what medicine would act like how you said
3/1/20, 4:28 PM - Tim Ko: But i think the option is more, how much to focus on accessible tech vs new innovative tech
3/1/20, 4:28 PM - Matt Casali: My closest analog is a coronavirus vaccine that wont be guaranteed to be affordable
3/1/20, 4:28 PM - Tim Ko: Which is kinda hard for me cuz I’m all for innovation
3/1/20, 4:29 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah that’s more on the health care system
3/1/20, 4:29 PM - Alex Starr: Cancer immunotherapy
3/1/20, 4:29 PM - Tim Ko: Rather than the tech itself
3/1/20, 4:29 PM - Alex Starr: It’s a magic bullet in some cases but so fucking expensive
3/1/20, 4:29 PM - Alex Starr: And not many treatment centers
3/1/20, 4:30 PM - Alex Starr: I’m all for it but some times political and economic realities make it infeasible
3/1/20, 4:30 PM - Tim Ko: I think in that case that’s fine but now the focus should on how to make cancer immunotherapy more accessible
3/1/20, 4:31 PM - Alex Starr: I agree
3/1/20, 4:31 PM - Alex Starr: But don’t think should matters much
3/1/20, 4:31 PM - Alex Starr: It’s about what we can get done not what should get done
3/1/20, 4:31 PM - Alex Starr: And with medical stuff it usually just takes a while.
3/1/20, 4:32 PM - Alex Starr: I think it boils down to that, imo, aiming for both climate change and inequality makes it much less likely we will nail climate change.
3/1/20, 4:34 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah but what if we nail it down here, but places like China is still shit
3/1/20, 4:34 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t think that is hugely relevant to inequality
3/1/20, 4:34 PM - Alex Starr: Africa is probably a better example
3/1/20, 4:35 PM - Alex Starr: And there I agree foreign intervention (potentially by the US and likely in the form of money contingent on certain factors) to ensure industrialization is as green and low population as possible would be ideal
3/1/20, 4:36 PM - Tim Ko: For sure
3/1/20, 4:37 PM - Alex Starr: Which will incidentally do great things for inequality, but pitching it like that is a mistake and that isn’t my goal
3/1/20, 4:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: Very much agree
3/1/20, 4:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: Innovation literally creates unfairness and I’d prioritize the former 100%
3/1/20, 4:42 PM - Matt Casali: Degrowth model baby
3/1/20, 4:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: What is that
3/1/20, 4:45 PM - Alex Starr: Also, I think this got swept under the rug.  Climate change is the only thing that will make things worse.  All boats will rise for the most part (to varying degrees), barring serious environmental damage
3/1/20, 4:49 PM - Matt Casali: The wikipedia page is a good account of what it is
3/1/20, 4:52 PM - Alex Starr: Well I agree with half of it
3/1/20, 4:54 PM - Alex Starr: Seems hard to implement
3/1/20, 4:58 PM - Matt Casali: Cause it requires a change in ideology
3/1/20, 4:58 PM - Matt Casali: Specifically this one
3/1/20, 5:02 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t think it’s that one that’s hard
3/1/20, 5:03 PM - Alex Starr: Tho I agree it’s a big one
3/1/20, 5:03 PM - Alex Starr: Let’s say the us adopts it.  China shits all over us
3/1/20, 5:03 PM - Alex Starr: There is insufficient trust between nations
3/1/20, 5:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Could I get a quick summary
3/1/20, 5:03 PM - Alex Starr: And would we give up scientific progress as well?
3/1/20, 5:03 PM - Alex Starr: Stop growing, stop consuming so much.
3/1/20, 5:04 PM - Alex Starr: Shift the economy to shrink to a sustainable level and maintain there
3/1/20, 5:04 PM - Alex Starr: Something about focusing on family, art, and nature which they lost me on
3/1/20, 5:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: That doesn’t seem great
3/1/20, 5:05 PM - Matt Casali: Basically that production doesn't have to be our main drive
3/1/20, 5:06 PM - Matt Casali: I mean I'm not necessarily gonna try to sell you on it
3/1/20, 5:06 PM - Matt Casali: It's an idealization and not something that I think is implementable as this stage in the game
3/1/20, 5:07 PM - Matt Casali: I mean what type of scientific progress
3/1/20, 5:07 PM - Matt Casali: I love the idea of science as a curiosity
3/1/20, 5:08 PM - Matt Casali: But I dont the parts that are perceived as valuable now --> profit, exploitation of the environment, power over others
3/1/20, 5:09 PM - Matt Casali: *don't love
3/1/20, 5:10 PM - Alex Starr: Innovation in science I meant
3/1/20, 5:10 PM - Alex Starr: Innovation and science are pretty inseparable
3/1/20, 5:11 PM - Alex Starr: I’m very much pro trying to get away from an economic system predicated on growth
3/1/20, 5:11 PM - Matt Casali: I dont think they're necessarily arguing against innovation in science
3/1/20, 5:12 PM - Matt Casali: Maybe more against innovation for the sole purpose of production
3/1/20, 5:13 PM - Jason Greenberg: If you can think of a better way to get everyone to cooperate on innovation that largely regulates itself let’s hear it
3/1/20, 5:14 PM - Alex Starr: It doesn’t have to be better
3/1/20, 5:14 PM - Alex Starr: Continued growth can only lead to collapse
3/1/20, 5:15 PM - Matt Casali: ^
3/1/20, 5:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: Is that assuming limited resources?
3/1/20, 5:15 PM - Alex Starr: Resources are always limited
3/1/20, 5:15 PM - Matt Casali: Resources are limited
3/1/20, 5:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: Or was that a physics statement
3/1/20, 5:15 PM - Alex Starr: It was an economic one
3/1/20, 5:16 PM - Alex Starr: And ecological
3/1/20, 5:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: Could I get some expansion on how continued growth would inevitably lead to economic collapse
3/1/20, 5:17 PM - Alex Starr: In the extreme we run out of earth
3/1/20, 5:18 PM - Alex Starr: But nearer term, growth seems really hard to decouple from CO2 admissions.
3/1/20, 5:18 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hmm ok
3/1/20, 5:18 PM - Alex Starr: Emissions.  Sorry grad school on the brain
3/1/20, 5:18 PM - Matt Casali: I mean growth is also not everything its cut out to be. As it is now, it relies on the abuse of marginalized people
3/1/20, 5:18 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lol
3/1/20, 5:19 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t think that’s an effective angle
3/1/20, 5:20 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah, just wanted to put it out there
3/1/20, 5:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ok let’s say we hypothetically figure out sustainable growth perfectly on earth, you run out of resources so expand to another planet and then you run out of planets?
3/1/20, 5:20 PM - Matt Casali: Like that theres other reasons that focusing solely on growth is bad
3/1/20, 5:20 PM - Matt Casali: Why is that the goal?
3/1/20, 5:20 PM - Alex Starr: Yes
3/1/20, 5:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: Proliferation of our species
3/1/20, 5:21 PM - Alex Starr: Advancement of science and art
3/1/20, 5:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: And increased innovation
3/1/20, 5:22 PM - Alex Starr: See all the myriad human variation possible
3/1/20, 5:22 PM - Alex Starr: Explore the galaxy
3/1/20, 5:22 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ok so this may be a dumb question but what about an infinite universe?
3/1/20, 5:22 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz we goddamn can
3/1/20, 5:22 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah but can you imagine how many people will be hurt in the process?
3/1/20, 5:22 PM - Alex Starr: You ever tried to access infinity? I got to like 3,807 and quit.  Shit is hard.
3/1/20, 5:23 PM - Matt Casali: And will continue to be hurt
3/1/20, 5:23 PM - Alex Starr: Yes
3/1/20, 5:23 PM - Matt Casali: So long as we keep justifying
3/1/20, 5:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: Life is suffering
3/1/20, 5:23 PM - Matt Casali: But not for you
3/1/20, 5:23 PM - Matt Casali: You may suffer
3/1/20, 5:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: Anything worth doing is going to have some risk associated with it
3/1/20, 5:23 PM - Matt Casali: I'm not trying to take that away from you
3/1/20, 5:23 PM - Alex Starr: ^^
3/1/20, 5:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: What I meant me too lol
3/1/20, 5:23 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah but it's not the same jason
3/1/20, 5:24 PM - Matt Casali: You're not affected the same way
3/1/20, 5:24 PM - Alex Starr: I mean you can’t know that but I see your point and raise you indifference
3/1/20, 5:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: It was to your point of people will get hurt along the way
3/1/20, 5:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
3/1/20, 5:25 PM - Alex Starr: In my mind suffering is worth that kind of advancement
3/1/20, 5:25 PM - Alex Starr: It should be mitigated
3/1/20, 5:25 PM - Alex Starr: But at the end of the day I’m of the opinion that their is one sin and one grace for humanity
3/1/20, 5:26 PM - Alex Starr: The sin being extinction and the grace survival, advancement, and proliferation.  Which I freely acknowledge is more than 1 word, but let’s lump it under “victory”.
3/1/20, 5:26 PM - Matt Casali: Advancement for the people who dont have to suffer
3/1/20, 5:26 PM - Matt Casali: Alex it's like you dont even read sci fi
3/1/20, 5:26 PM - Matt Casali: C'mon man
3/1/20, 5:26 PM - Alex Starr: The people who suffer can also advance
3/1/20, 5:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: This is true
3/1/20, 5:27 PM - Alex Starr: Things have improved drastically for the vast majority of the population since even 1900
3/1/20, 5:27 PM - Alex Starr: Climate change threatens that advancement sure
3/1/20, 5:27 PM - Alex Starr: But still
3/1/20, 5:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah it’s like 80% of people were in extreme poverty during the 1800s
3/1/20, 5:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Today is 10%
3/1/20, 5:28 PM - Alex Starr: And like rocket propelled snowboarding levels of extreme
3/1/20, 5:30 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah, we dont have slavery, I guess we're all good!
3/1/20, 5:30 PM - Alex Starr: No we said better not good
3/1/20, 5:30 PM - Matt Casali: I'm saying that inequality is what matters
3/1/20, 5:30 PM - Matt Casali: Everyone benefits but some benefit astronomically more
3/1/20, 5:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: Is anyone saying we’re all good?
3/1/20, 5:31 PM - Matt Casali: No it seems like you're saying that we don't need to address the problems that gave us slavery
3/1/20, 5:31 PM - Alex Starr: Right id rather have that than no benefit or slight benefit for all or even the same benefit for all of there was net lower benefit
3/1/20, 5:31 PM - Alex Starr: Not slavery
3/1/20, 5:31 PM - Alex Starr: See previous message
3/1/20, 5:32 PM - Alex Starr: Although one of my CAH cards was “good clean colorblind slavery”
3/1/20, 5:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: Nope not saying that
3/1/20, 5:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha
3/1/20, 5:37 PM - Alex Starr: There’s a sharp difference between don’t need to address and should and will address but isn’t the most pressing concern cuz Bangladesh is going to be underwater underserved or not
3/1/20, 5:42 PM - Alex Starr: But at least they won’t be slaves
3/1/20, 6:03 PM - Alex Starr: Well the conversation seems to have petered out, but it was interesting hearing your thoughts Matt.  They fall along very different lines than mine
3/1/20, 6:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: I think it’ll be interesting to talk about this stuff in person if it ever comes up
3/1/20, 6:43 PM - Tim Ko: I think the world is getting ever more divisive and if anything, we’ll kill each other all before climate does
3/1/20, 6:44 PM - Alex Starr: I wouldn’t bet on it
3/1/20, 6:44 PM - Alex Starr: Or if we do, climate change will have played a huge part
3/1/20, 6:44 PM - Tim Ko: That’s true, it’s not an either or
3/1/20, 6:46 PM - Tim Ko: But inequality may be a bigger issue
3/1/20, 6:47 PM - Alex Starr: Poor people don’t have nuclear weapons
3/1/20, 6:47 PM - Alex Starr: Or engineer viruses
3/1/20, 6:47 PM - Alex Starr: In fact they tend to be rather hungry and have trouble becoming existential threats
3/1/20, 6:49 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah but if u have enough poor people rallying together
3/1/20, 6:49 PM - Alex Starr: Then they burn some city
3/1/20, 6:49 PM - Alex Starr: Hardly earth threatening
3/1/20, 6:49 PM - Tim Ko: Or enough oppressed people rallying together
3/1/20, 6:50 PM - Alex Starr: And soldiers are pretty effective against the poor
3/1/20, 6:50 PM - Alex Starr: You’d have to be pretty oppressed to say fuck food and medicine
3/1/20, 6:50 PM - Tim Ko: I think ur underestimating the power of the mass
3/1/20, 6:50 PM - Alex Starr: No merely their motivations
3/1/20, 6:51 PM - Alex Starr: They don’t want the earth destroyed, they want better lives
3/1/20, 6:51 PM - Tim Ko: Also inequality can lead to rise in insuregent and radical groups
3/1/20, 6:51 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah but again hard to imagine insurgents drowning Bangladesh
3/1/20, 6:51 PM - Alex Starr: Some light 9/11 sure
3/1/20, 6:52 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah, but that’s how all this conflict starts
3/1/20, 6:52 PM - Tim Ko: And it build and builds
3/1/20, 6:52 PM - Alex Starr: Doesn’t seem to
3/1/20, 6:52 PM - Tim Ko: And soon u have countries taking sides
3/1/20, 6:52 PM - Alex Starr: WWII death toll was what? 100 million?
3/1/20, 6:52 PM - Alex Starr: Including disease
3/1/20, 6:53 PM - Alex Starr: Barring large scale nuclear war, it’s hard to imagine much damage being done.
3/1/20, 6:54 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah if anything, it won’t be soon
3/1/20, 6:54 PM - Tim Ko: But I still think the big driver would be opression and inequality
3/1/20, 6:55 PM - Alex Starr: For nuclear war?
3/1/20, 6:55 PM - Alex Starr: It would definitely be geopolitical conflict imo
3/1/20, 6:55 PM - Alex Starr: Inequality drives revolution not mass destruction
3/1/20, 6:57 PM - Alex Starr: That said I do agree it is somewhat of a threat, just not climate change level
3/1/20, 6:57 PM - Alex Starr: People can be manipulated, reasoned with, bribed, and murdered.  Greenhouse gases and oceans not so much
3/1/20, 8:27 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah true
3/1/20, 8:28 PM - Tim Ko: Is there an estimate of how long until the earth becomes inhabitable if climate keeps changing at the rate it doesn rn?
3/1/20, 8:29 PM - Alex Starr: It’s not uninhabitable that you have to watch out for.  There’s so much bad shit before that point
3/1/20, 8:29 PM - Alex Starr: And the other issue is that once a certain level of warming is reached, geological processes occur that rapidly and unstoppably accelerate that warming
3/1/20, 8:30 PM - Alex Starr: So it’s very hard to predict
3/1/20, 8:30 PM - Alex Starr: But current pace 2050 we’re pretty thoroughly fucked
3/1/20, 8:30 PM - Alex Starr: 2030 we aren’t happy
3/1/20, 8:30 PM - Alex Starr: 2100 New York is the new Venice and Miami is the new Atlantis
3/1/20, 8:32 PM - Tim Ko: Oh damn
3/1/20, 8:32 PM - Tim Ko: That’s rlly soon
3/1/20, 8:33 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah
3/1/20, 8:33 PM - Alex Starr: Will you do anything about it? Start recycling? That’s the question that matters
3/1/20, 8:34 PM - Matt Casali: Recycling doesn't do shit
3/1/20, 8:34 PM - Matt Casali: Our recycling goes to the dump
3/1/20, 8:34 PM - Matt Casali: Cause of political issues with China
3/1/20, 8:34 PM - Matt Casali: Or at least a majority of it does
3/1/20, 8:36 PM - Alex Starr: That was a quick back track haha
3/1/20, 8:37 PM - Alex Starr: It absolutely does something
3/1/20, 8:37 PM - Alex Starr: And it’s a starting point
3/1/20, 8:38 PM - Alex Starr: You start recycling, then maybe think “huh it’d be better if I just used less plastic in general” or “recycling is easy, maybe I’ll eat a little less beef that’s easy too”
3/1/20, 8:38 PM - Alex Starr: Being hardline from a position of weakness is futile
3/1/20, 8:39 PM - Tim Ko: I used to eat a lot of beef in hs but I’ve cut down a lot in college
3/1/20, 8:39 PM - Tim Ko: Partly health, price and environment reasons
3/1/20, 8:40 PM - Alex Starr: I know.  It’s good and I appreciate it.
3/1/20, 8:40 PM - Alex Starr: But it’s key to keep working at stuff
3/1/20, 8:41 PM - Tim Ko: Electric vehicle make a big difference?
3/1/20, 8:41 PM - Tim Ko: Would be something to consider in the future
3/1/20, 8:44 PM - Alex Starr: Huge difference
3/1/20, 8:44 PM - Alex Starr: It, solar (which you can pay a little extra to ensure that’s all you get from a power company), and diet are by far the biggest factors
3/1/20, 10:41 PM - Tim Ko: For sure
3/1/20, 10:42 PM - Tim Ko: Don’t we get a lot of our electricity from water and wind turbines
3/1/20, 11:18 PM - Matt Casali: Depends on where you are in the country
3/1/20, 11:18 PM - Matt Casali: But as of 2018 only like 20% of our energy came from renewables or something
3/1/20, 11:29 PM - Tim Ko: I see

3/2/20, 12:02 PM - Jason Greenberg: No idea
3/2/20, 12:02 PM - Collin Hurst: Biden has a better chance over trump huh
3/2/20, 12:02 PM - Jason Greenberg: <Media omitted>
3/2/20, 12:03 PM - Alex Starr: I’ve been saying if
3/2/20, 12:03 PM - Alex Starr: It
3/2/20, 12:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: Do we know what the most important swing states are? I remember you said Wisconsin Alex and here Trump beats both Sanders and Biden by 7 points
3/2/20, 12:06 PM - Alex Starr: That’s really bad
3/2/20, 12:06 PM - Alex Starr: I’m not sure Pennsylvania and Michigan alone are enough
3/2/20, 12:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: Is it only up to Wisconsin?
3/2/20, 12:08 PM - Alex Starr: I’m not sure
3/2/20, 12:44 PM - Matt Casali: Him and Hillary are so similar (both establishment democrats) and we though that about Hillary
3/2/20, 12:45 PM - Darren: $hillary
3/2/20, 12:46 PM - Matt Casali: Biden is Male so that makes a difference I guess
3/2/20, 12:46 PM - Matt Casali: But Trump is gonna tear him up

3/2/20, 1:08 PM - Alex Starr: I’ll take that as a “no we are not”
3/2/20, 1:09 PM - Alex Starr: And assume you will get on it
3/2/20, 1:10 PM - Collin Hurst: Goodwill hunting? Wasn't that harvard
3/2/20, 1:10 PM - Ricky: HOW BOUT THEM AAHHPAHLS
3/2/20, 1:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: Make sure to throw away your opportunities and be told you’re just a kid
3/2/20, 1:11 PM - Ricky: But never forget that it’s not your fault
3/2/20, 1:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha
3/2/20, 1:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: Don’t fuck with me Rick, not you
3/2/20, 1:13 PM - Darren: Top 10 anime betrayals

3/2/20, 2:21 PM - Collin Hurst: Hm
3/2/20, 2:22 PM - Collin Hurst: Im down for a lil corona virus to slice up the trip
3/2/20, 2:23 PM - Alex Starr: Would you still be down if after returning to the Us you had to be under essentially house arrest for 2 weeks?
3/2/20, 2:25 PM - Collin Hurst: Do i get free food
3/2/20, 2:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: No
3/2/20, 2:25 PM - Collin Hurst: Shit
3/2/20, 2:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: But purell costs $30 for a little one so you’ve got that going on
3/2/20, 2:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: Class generally or at UC Berkeley?
3/2/20, 2:25 PM - Collin Hurst: What
3/2/20, 2:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: There’s a shortage of hand sanitizer rn
3/2/20, 2:25 PM - Collin Hurst: Where are you getting your prices
3/2/20, 2:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: Go online
3/2/20, 2:26 PM - Darren: Apparently costco in santa cruz is sold out of paper towels and various disinfectant wipes
3/2/20, 2:26 PM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
3/2/20, 2:26 PM - Darren: According to my class mates girlfriend who works there
3/2/20, 2:27 PM - Collin Hurst: Amazon brand is still ok
3/2/20, 2:27 PM - Alex Starr: Berkeley
3/2/20, 2:27 PM - Collin Hurst: But damn 17$ for a 3 oz bottle lmao
3/2/20, 2:27 PM - Alex Starr: People are weird
3/2/20, 2:27 PM - Alex Starr: It’s corona virus not corona bacterial
3/2/20, 2:27 PM - Collin Hurst: My mom is annoying about it
3/2/20, 2:27 PM - Darren: I'm honestly surprised ucsc doesn't have corona yet
3/2/20, 2:28 PM - Collin Hurst: What type of virus?
3/2/20, 2:28 PM - Alex Starr: Real questions is whether you’d rather have to drink corona beer or get corona virus
3/2/20, 2:28 PM - Alex Starr: Fuck if I know
3/2/20, 2:28 PM - Collin Hurst: But like how does it spread
3/2/20, 2:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: Are any of those in stock
3/2/20, 2:29 PM - Alex Starr: Imaaaaagination
3/2/20, 2:29 PM - Collin Hurst: Oh yeah the amazon ones aren't lol
3/2/20, 2:30 PM - Alex Starr: I straight up have no idea Collin
3/2/20, 2:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: 30 percent of Americans polled said they could absolutely not buy Corona beer because of the corona virus
3/2/20, 2:30 PM - Alex Starr: I know haha
3/2/20, 2:30 PM - Darren: PSA: If you get corona virus, you better also get limes disease cause you can't have one without the other
3/2/20, 2:30 PM - Alex Starr: It’s only because there wasn’t a “I absolutely wont buy corona beer.” Option.
3/2/20, 2:31 PM - Collin Hurst: But what's the difference here
3/2/20, 2:31 PM - Collin Hurst: Cause you still should wipe down stuff if you're trying to prevent it I thought
3/2/20, 2:32 PM - Alex Starr: I again have no idea
3/2/20, 2:32 PM - Alex Starr: Just think hand sanitizer is kinda dumb
3/2/20, 2:34 PM - Alex Starr: As long as you aren’t wiping your hands on surfaces then wiping it on your tongue, nose, or eyes you are all good
3/2/20, 2:34 PM - Alex Starr: And simple disinfectant works.
3/2/20, 2:35 PM - Alex Starr: All based on a random NY times article
3/2/20, 2:36 PM - Parker: hahaha yesss
3/2/20, 2:36 PM - Parker: A couple classes here got cancelled
3/2/20, 2:37 PM - Parker: first case in oregon was confirmed in portland
3/2/20, 2:37 PM - Darren: Gonzaga in Spokane also has it
3/2/20, 2:37 PM - Darren: GDC and F8 were both cancelled due to corona
3/2/20, 2:38 PM - Parker: Probably doing the country a favor tbh
3/2/20, 2:38 PM - Darren: rt
3/2/20, 2:46 PM - Collin Hurst: What if i directly wipe my eyes on surfaces
3/2/20, 3:08 PM - Alex Starr: That’s the dream
3/2/20, 3:55 PM - Tim Ko: Hopefully it doesn’t spread to France and Amsterdam
3/2/20, 3:56 PM - Darren: Not unlikely
3/2/20, 3:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: It would be unfortunate
3/2/20, 3:56 PM - Tim Ko: U think they would refund flights?
3/2/20, 3:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: I'd say backup plan should be camping in Alex's backyard for 7 days straight
3/2/20, 3:56 PM - Tim Ko: Haha down
3/2/20, 3:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: If you got insurance yes
3/2/20, 3:57 PM - Tim Ko: But In the case that we ban travel to Europe
3/2/20, 3:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: If the travel advisory is against travel their or the airline cancels flights to those locations then it's a good chance of getting your money back
3/2/20, 3:58 PM - Tim Ko: Ah got it nice
3/2/20, 3:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: The harder part will be for our Airbnb or Hostel refunds potentially
3/2/20, 3:58 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah but that’s ok
3/2/20, 3:58 PM - Tim Ko: Can’t win em all
3/2/20, 3:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hayley got a full refund from her cancelled China flight
3/2/20, 3:58 PM - Tim Ko: Also those u can cancel earlier and get refund
3/2/20, 3:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: Where the airline cancelled flights
3/2/20, 3:58 PM - Tim Ko: Oooo nice
3/2/20, 3:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: Right in theory
3/2/20, 3:59 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah, I think those are usually more leeway than flights
3/2/20, 4:04 PM - Alex Starr: The Airbnb has a dope cancellation policy I made sure
3/2/20, 4:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: The Amsterdam hostel has a 1-day cancellation policy it turns out, so also good there
3/2/20, 4:06 PM - Parker: yeah you gotta get that insurance timmy
3/2/20, 4:06 PM - Parker: i got it when i bought mine yesterday without even thinking of the virus haha
3/2/20, 4:06 PM - Alex Starr: Eh they often give you the equivalent in flying money if you don’t get insurance
3/2/20, 4:07 PM - Parker: if they ban all travel then yeah probably but idk airlines are usually pretty stingy
3/2/20, 4:09 PM - Parker: I learned in my capstone class that it’s one of the least profitable industries out there so it makes sense that they are
3/2/20, 4:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: The Louvre was closed today out of fear of international visitors spreading the disease to the workers
3/2/20, 4:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: In other relevant unfortunate news
3/2/20, 4:45 PM - Tim Ko: Damn :(
3/2/20, 4:45 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah I’m sure they’ll give credit
3/2/20, 4:46 PM - Tim Ko: Like if the situation gets very bad
3/2/20, 4:46 PM - Tim Ko: That’s the good thing about going with an American airline
3/2/20, 4:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: Individualism at its finest?
3/2/20, 6:57 PM - Alex Starr: Edit: I am now taking coronavirus very seriously.  Please disregard any previous levity.
3/2/20, 6:59 PM - Collin Hurst: what happened
3/2/20, 6:59 PM - Alex Starr: I read about it
3/2/20, 6:59 PM - Matt Casali: Red alert 🚨🚨
3/2/20, 7:01 PM - Tim Ko: Alex has been hearing me cough for the past month 👀
3/2/20, 7:02 PM - Alex Starr: Huh didn’t think about that
3/2/20, 7:02 PM - Alex Starr: Don’t touch my shit
3/2/20, 7:03 PM - Darren: Plus Tim's professor just came back from wuhan
3/2/20, 7:03 PM - Darren: Or PA or whatever
3/2/20, 7:05 PM - Alex Starr: What changed my mind is that if I get infected I may infect people more likely to be seriously hit.
3/2/20, 7:06 PM - Alex Starr: Not taking precautions is like not getting vaccinated at this poin
3/2/20, 7:06 PM - Alex Starr: Point
3/2/20, 7:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: This is what I was explaining to my mom yesterday
3/2/20, 7:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: You don’t want to be in some way responsible for the death of an elderly person
3/2/20, 7:08 PM - Tim Ko: Lol nah I think he’s still there, he never returned my txt
3/2/20, 7:08 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah
3/2/20, 7:09 PM - Tim Ko: Nah I’d prob be dead by now if I had it
3/2/20, 7:10 PM - Alex Starr: Probably not
3/2/20, 7:11 PM - Alex Starr: But sick sure
3/2/20, 7:11 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah Tim you might want to consider getting checked out for unrelated reasons haha
3/2/20, 7:15 PM - Tim Ko: Maybe, if I take cough medicine, I stop coughing. I’ve just been way too lazy to take cough medicine
3/2/20, 7:15 PM - Tim Ko: But I’m taking it now everyday
3/2/20, 7:15 PM - Tim Ko: Figured prolonged coughing can have other consequences even if I feel fine rn
3/2/20, 7:25 PM - Alex Starr: Also just has to be annoying coughing a lot.
3/2/20, 7:25 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah it is
3/2/20, 7:30 PM - Darren: Dude I got sick again
3/2/20, 7:30 PM - Darren: Now it feels like a sinus related cold because I got mucus and shit
3/2/20, 7:30 PM - Collin Hurst: yucki
3/2/20, 7:31 PM - Darren: I guess my immune system wasn't ready for that party, because I was feeling good before that
3/2/20, 7:32 PM - Alex Starr: The classic rebound illness
3/2/20, 7:34 PM - Darren: At least it's not mono, i guess
3/2/20, 7:36 PM - Alex Starr: Or corona beer
3/2/20, 7:42 PM - Vaughn: Oh shit vanessa got sick too
3/2/20, 7:42 PM - Vaughn: I gotta do a deep cleaning of the house now
3/2/20, 7:43 PM - Collin Hurst: I wonder if coronas are cheaper now
3/2/20, 7:43 PM - Collin Hurst: apparently they have taken a big hit in sales
3/2/20, 7:44 PM - Darren: Darn
3/2/20, 7:53 PM - Darren: Are you sure you didn't just watch the john oliver?
3/2/20, 7:57 PM - Alex Starr: Yes
3/2/20, 7:59 PM - Parker: yeah they def are
3/2/20, 8:10 PM - Alex Starr: And still not worth it
3/2/20, 8:28 PM - Parker: add a lime though and there’s no ceiling on my WTP
3/3/20, 9:03 AM - Jason Greenberg: Vote for Biden
3/3/20, 9:04 AM - Jason Greenberg: Bernie is hip but he can't swing ex-Trump voters as well which is what matters
3/3/20, 9:12 AM - Alex Starr: Bingo
3/3/20, 9:51 AM - Matt Casali: Biden drools bernie roolz
3/3/20, 9:52 AM - Matt Casali: A damp pillow cant swing anyone
3/3/20, 9:52 AM - Matt Casali: Same thing was said about Hillary and look how that turned out
3/3/20, 9:54 AM - Collin Hurst: i kinda feel like a vote for bernie is a vote for trump
3/3/20, 9:54 AM - Collin Hurst: my dad convinced me
3/3/20, 9:56 AM - Parker: ^
3/3/20, 9:58 AM - Matt Casali: That's such bullshit
3/3/20, 9:58 AM - Matt Casali: A vote for biden is a vote for trump
3/3/20, 9:59 AM - Matt Casali: Sorry dave
3/3/20, 10:05 AM - Jason Greenberg: I do agree with you but the actual numbers for swing states show Bernie doing worse than Biden when faced against Trump
3/3/20, 10:05 AM - Jason Greenberg: And my highest goal is to not re-elect Trump
3/3/20, 10:05 AM - Jason Greenberg: I assume yours is too?
3/3/20, 10:09 AM - Collin Hurst: same
3/3/20, 10:10 AM - Matt Casali: Yes
3/3/20, 10:10 AM - Matt Casali: But those polls are so low because of that exact mentality
3/3/20, 10:11 AM - Matt Casali: And the fact that there are very powerful people spending a lot of money to spread that mentality
3/3/20, 10:12 AM - Matt Casali: Theres a lot of people voting for Bernie
3/3/20, 10:14 AM - Matt Casali: Bernie has an absolutely massive, passionate movement around him
3/3/20, 10:16 AM - Collin Hurst: But you need to take some of the trump voters
3/3/20, 10:16 AM - Collin Hurst: These people are the same ones that voted for hillary last time, we need others
3/3/20, 10:16 AM - Darren: Hey Matt might be onto something
3/3/20, 10:17 AM - Darren: By the general election, 70% of all people over 60 will be dead from corona virus so bernie's cohort of college students will be larger than trump's / bidens base
3/3/20, 10:20 AM - Matt Casali: No, but Bernie's base that he beats biden is minorities and they're gonna be hit hardest by coronavirus cause they cant fucking afford the vaccine so hes gonna los most of his support
3/3/20, 10:21 AM - Matt Casali: Like I said earlier, I dont know exact reasons but I've seen multiple polls putting bernie ahead of trump and biden losing to trump
3/3/20, 10:24 AM - Collin Hurst: Wait I thought there was no cv vaccine
3/3/20, 10:28 AM - Matt Casali: There will be and when there is it will not be guaranteed affordable
3/3/20, 10:30 AM - Collin Hurst: Im confused you're saying that I shouldn't vote for bernie then
3/3/20, 10:31 AM - Jason Greenberg: This is the biggest stretch of these statements
3/3/20, 10:32 AM - Jason Greenberg: I don’t think we can infer causation from self-report data
3/3/20, 10:34 AM - Matt Casali: I was making a joke haha
3/3/20, 10:35 AM - Matt Casali: I'm just saying, vote for who you're gonna vote for
3/3/20, 10:35 AM - Matt Casali: Whoever wins the nomination, rally behind them
3/3/20, 10:35 AM - Jason Greenberg: That’s not the issue
3/3/20, 10:35 AM - Jason Greenberg: Dems will win the popular vote
3/3/20, 10:36 AM - Jason Greenberg: But the electoral college is how trump one last time and how it would happen again
3/3/20, 10:36 AM - Jason Greenberg: won*
3/3/20, 10:36 AM - Jason Greenberg: That’s why the swing states are so important
3/3/20, 10:36 AM - Matt Casali: I'm not gonna let that determine who I vote for
3/3/20, 10:36 AM - Jason Greenberg: And predicting who they would vote for in each scenario is how I’m basing my vote
3/3/20, 10:36 AM - Alex Starr: Imo passionately wrong.
3/3/20, 10:37 AM - Jason Greenberg: You don’t have to but I think it’s probably not the best strategy if you don’t want Trump to win
3/3/20, 10:37 AM - Matt Casali: I'm gonna vote for Biden in the general if he wins the primary
3/3/20, 10:38 AM - Jason Greenberg: Obviously lol
3/3/20, 10:38 AM - Matt Casali: I'm gonna vote for the democratic candidate
3/3/20, 10:38 AM - Jason Greenberg: Where’s the surprised face emoji
3/3/20, 10:39 AM - Jason Greenberg: I’m not sure you understand the ramifications of picking a candidate who would not do as well against trump
3/3/20, 10:39 AM - Matt Casali: Imo the best strategy is proving that bernie is the type of candidate I want
3/3/20, 10:39 AM - Jason Greenberg: Not do as well is defined as ability to sway ex-trump voters in swing states
3/3/20, 10:40 AM - Collin Hurst: It's not about the candidate that we want it's about the candidate that would win those swing states
3/3/20, 10:40 AM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
3/3/20, 10:40 AM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
3/3/20, 10:40 AM - Matt Casali: That's fucked and that's not how you should vote
3/3/20, 10:41 AM - Jason Greenberg: I’m not sure about the validity of those polls but also they don’t prove your point very well
3/3/20, 10:42 AM - Jason Greenberg: What the margin of error on those polls is what I’d be asking myself as well
3/3/20, 10:43 AM - Jason Greenberg: And are they conducted by an independent nonpartisan group
3/3/20, 10:43 AM - Matt Casali: Well it's what I found
3/3/20, 10:44 AM - Matt Casali: I dont know any history of the group it was just the firs one that popped up haha
3/3/20, 10:44 AM - Matt Casali: Alsooo
3/3/20, 10:44 AM - Jason Greenberg: It’s literally like only biased cable news
3/3/20, 10:44 AM - Jason Greenberg: But even if they were true they don’t support your argument
3/3/20, 10:45 AM - Matt Casali: We're kinda kidding ourselves if we think that trump isnt gonna get reelected
3/3/20, 10:45 AM - Jason Greenberg: Biden is ahead and with a large margin of error you’d have to pick the candidate with the highest points over Trump
3/3/20, 10:45 AM - Jason Greenberg: In your own poll
3/3/20, 10:45 AM - Matt Casali: That was more for you guys
3/3/20, 10:46 AM - Matt Casali: I'm voting for Bernie cause he aligns with my views
3/3/20, 10:46 AM - Matt Casali: That is all
3/3/20, 10:46 AM - Jason Greenberg: We’ll see how it pans out
3/3/20, 10:47 AM - Matt Casali: Ye
3/3/20, 10:47 AM - Matt Casali: I'm excited
3/3/20, 10:47 AM - Jason Greenberg: For this?
3/3/20, 10:48 AM - Matt Casali: No to see if the country is ready for actual change and just not centrism after four years of trum0
3/3/20, 10:48 AM - Jason Greenberg: Lol I hope you get to see it
3/3/20, 10:49 AM - Matt Casali: Probably not
3/3/20, 10:49 AM - Matt Casali: And that will be good to know too
3/3/20, 10:49 AM - Jason Greenberg: Knowledge is power
3/3/20, 11:03 AM - Parker: Facts
3/3/20, 11:04 AM - Parker: Or you just don’t care about the primary and put all your energy into whoever wins the nomination
3/3/20, 11:25 AM - Jason Greenberg: That planning style is akin to saying I want a good career and I don’t care too much about my college but boy am I gonna work hard when I get to Penn State
3/3/20, 11:25 AM - Jason Greenberg: You could’ve planned ahead but the Sandusky memes were too good
3/3/20, 11:26 AM - Parker: Haha i’m mostly kidding
3/3/20, 11:26 AM - Parker: though my mindset is much more focused on beating trump then for any one candidate
3/3/20, 11:26 AM - Parker: But i also haven’t followed the primaries too closely
3/3/20, 11:45 AM - Alex Starr: This comment is the only one I read and I’m very happy with that outcome
3/3/20, 11:55 AM - Jason Greenberg: Lol
3/3/20, 12:36 PM - Alex Starr: Read the other comments and regretted it
3/3/20, 6:38 PM - Alex Starr: Goddamn it.  Stanford biology recruitment usually throws a huge party, but may be canceling it due to corona virus
3/3/20, 6:40 PM - Collin Hurst: Oof
3/3/20, 6:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: You should buy a bunch of corona and tell them you’re bringing the party
3/3/20, 8:12 PM - Alex Starr: Eh they will certainly have better alcohol
3/3/20, 8:13 PM - Jason Greenberg: Good you passed the test
3/3/20, 8:19 PM - Alex Starr: The real first test is remembering your name tag

3/3/20, 8:38 PM - Alex Starr: I just hope whoever is clearly losing concedes.  Sanders dragging it out last time helped trump

3/5/20, 2:19 PM - Matt Casali: But he said this when it was being said that it was above 3
3/5/20, 2:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: The point about what one death in your area signals I hadn’t thought about
3/5/20, 2:20 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah neither had I
3/5/20, 2:21 PM - Matt Casali: Also I didnt consider that because the death rate is lower for younger people then its devastating for older people
3/5/20, 9:32 PM - Matt Casali: GUYS what were the gaming websites?

3/5/20, 10:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: 100% the shot a scene at uC Santa Cruz
3/5/20, 10:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: It’s a sci fi show written by same guy who wrote ex machina
3/5/20, 10:31 PM - Darren: Oh, they shot the whole thing here
3/5/20, 10:31 PM - Darren: At McHenry
3/5/20, 10:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: Damn
3/5/20, 10:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: I thought I recognized it
3/5/20, 10:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: Did you see them do it?
3/5/20, 10:32 PM - Darren: No, but we get emails about it
3/5/20, 10:32 PM - Darren: Oh shit, Nick Offerman is in it
3/5/20, 10:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah he looks very Santa Cruz in this
3/5/20, 10:35 PM - Darren: It looks like the boring half of assassin's Creed
3/5/20, 10:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: That’s what your dad said when you were born
3/5/20, 10:38 PM - Darren: Uh
3/5/20, 10:46 PM - Parker: Lol
3/6/20, 7:00 AM - Alex Starr: I think we should begin considering the possibility that corona virus will cancel our trip.  On the bright side, it should hurt trumps chances.
3/6/20, 9:40 AM - Ricky: If it does I vote we do something in the states and push to go to similar places in the future
3/6/20, 9:41 AM - Ricky: Cough go to my cabin in Idaho cough
3/6/20, 9:41 AM - Parker: Cough go to my dads house in seattlrncough
3/6/20, 9:42 AM - Alex Starr: Darren and I were thinking going all out in SF or NY could be cool
3/6/20, 9:53 AM - Parker: fuck sf
3/6/20, 9:56 AM - Alex Starr: I am quite against Idaho.  Not sure why Seattle > SF but willing to discuss
3/6/20, 9:58 AM - Parker: I mean do we wanna do a grad trip that’s only 45 mins away from us and somewhere we all go a decent amount
3/6/20, 9:59 AM - Jason Greenberg: If planes are the issue driving would naturally be the answer
3/6/20, 10:00 AM - Jason Greenberg: Also Seattle is corona central let’s not go there
3/6/20, 10:01 AM - Jason Greenberg: How long is the drive to Idaho?
3/6/20, 10:03 AM - Darren: Ok, but I feel like visiting SF with an unlimited vacation level budget is different than when we normally go
3/6/20, 10:04 AM - Parker: Or we can rain check for like 5 years, save up real money and then go an insanely dope trip
3/6/20, 10:04 AM - Darren: We tend to be pretty cost adverse and SF has so many dope things that cost money
3/6/20, 10:04 AM - Parker: yeah but i did that with fam growing up a few times so i’m less inclined haha
3/6/20, 10:07 AM - Parker: or like weekend getaways i guess
3/6/20, 10:07 AM - Darren: ^
3/6/20, 10:08 AM - Parker: And yes very true
3/6/20, 10:19 AM - Alex Starr: I’ve never done SF all out
3/6/20, 10:21 AM - Alex Starr: And as previously stated am against Idaho.  Can’t be overstated how much
3/6/20, 10:22 AM - Jason Greenberg: Is it Idaho or roadtripping generally?
3/6/20, 10:28 AM - Alex Starr: Road tripping
3/6/20, 10:28 AM - Alex Starr: Especially to Idaho and adjacent areas
3/6/20, 10:28 AM - Alex Starr: Like drive to Vegas I’m down
3/6/20, 10:30 AM - Jason Greenberg: Vegas is an 8 hour drive
3/6/20, 10:31 AM - Jason Greenberg: Is there a cap that you would be willing to go or does it depend on the destination?
3/6/20, 10:32 AM - Parker: I’d be down for vegas
3/6/20, 10:34 AM - Alex Starr: Super destination dependent
3/6/20, 10:34 AM - Alex Starr: Very much pro city over not
3/6/20, 10:37 AM - Jason Greenberg: Gotcha
3/6/20, 10:40 AM - Jason Greenberg: Man it’s tough because nothing is as cool as Europe would be
3/6/20, 10:40 AM - Darren: I wouldn't be surprised if Vegas gets biiiig corona soon
3/6/20, 10:42 AM - Alex Starr: Part of the appeal of SF
3/6/20, 10:42 AM - Alex Starr: On a trip in which we deny travel it’s a good way to travel
3/6/20, 10:42 AM - Alex Starr: Are denied
3/6/20, 10:43 AM - Collin Hurst: Hawaii pivot???
3/6/20, 10:43 AM - Collin Hurst: Yeah I’m down
3/6/20, 10:45 AM - Jason Greenberg: We should just do a week-long sleepover at someone’s house
3/6/20, 10:45 AM - Jason Greenberg: The bonding would be unprecedented
3/6/20, 10:55 AM - Matt Casali: Down
3/6/20, 11:01 AM - Alex Starr: Okay that’s too close
3/6/20, 11:01 AM - Collin Hurst: Booooooooooooooooooooooo

3/6/20, 11:03 AM - Alex Starr: Ricky

3/6/20, 11:06 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah it is tropical
3/6/20, 11:06 AM - Alex Starr: I’m just concerned there will be hardcore travel restrictions
3/6/20, 11:06 AM - Jason Greenberg: The problem with flying anywhere is the possibility of travel restrictions
3/6/20, 11:06 AM - Jason Greenberg: Yup
3/6/20, 11:14 AM - Ricky: We should just do acid everyday for a week in peoples park
3/6/20, 11:33 AM - Jason Greenberg: Matt are you gonna come with us if it’s a no-fly trip or nah?
3/6/20, 11:33 AM - Ricky: ^^^^^^^^!!!!!!!!
3/6/20, 11:43 AM - Matt Casali: I think its really hard for me to commit cause I dont know if I'll have a job and if I do I don't know if I'll be able to get a lot of time off
3/6/20, 11:43 AM - Matt Casali: But I think it will make it a lot easier to decide later if I dont have to buy a plane ticket
3/6/20, 11:44 AM - Matt Casali: I'm gonna be applying heavily next quarter and I'll for sure try to update as often as I can
3/6/20, 11:44 AM - Matt Casali: Cause I really wanna go with you guys

3/6/20, 11:59 AM - Tim Ko: Oh woops maybe I read wrong
3/6/20, 11:59 AM - Parker: Yeah i feel like the landscape of this will look a lot different in 4 months
3/6/20, 12:00 PM - Tim Ko: Ah yes ur right alex, this summer for testing on humans, next summer safe for general public
3/6/20, 12:09 PM - Collin Hurst: Hawaii hawaii
3/6/20, 12:15 PM - Alex Starr: For the worse
3/6/20, 12:34 PM - Matt Casali: I mean you guys have blocked off a certain amount of time already and road trips are not nearly as hard to plan after that, so you can probably wait a little while to see what's going to happen right?
3/6/20, 12:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah if europe becomes off the table then we wouldn't need the same lead time
3/6/20, 1:20 PM - Alex Starr: I really really would like to avoid a road trip.  My family’s last drive to LA I was only sort of able to walk after
3/6/20, 1:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: If you were able to lie down and/or move about the cabin would that help?
3/6/20, 1:21 PM - Collin Hurst: We should go to Hawaii or Mexico
3/6/20, 1:21 PM - Collin Hurst: Or South America?
3/6/20, 1:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: Collin are you still high from yesterday
3/6/20, 1:22 PM - Jason Greenberg: It's the flying that's the problem as a backup plan
3/6/20, 1:22 PM - Collin Hurst: Nope just looking out for the group
3/6/20, 1:22 PM - Darren: I think a cruise may be our best bet
3/6/20, 1:22 PM - Darren: Instant quarantine
3/6/20, 1:22 PM - Collin Hurst: Sounds good
3/6/20, 1:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: We may as well do the around the world one
3/6/20, 1:23 PM - Darren: Hot air balloon trip

3/7/20, 7:45 PM - Alex Starr: Man wants to give 50 billion a year to the NIH.  That’s making me a professor money
3/7/20, 7:47 PM - Parker: The dudes struggling
3/7/20, 7:47 PM - Parker: also to be clear i’ve never been in favor of him
3/7/20, 7:47 PM - Parker: Did you see his press conference today?
3/7/20, 7:47 PM - Jason Greenberg: Didn't see it
3/7/20, 7:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: If it's a dementia thing yeah its not great
3/7/20, 7:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: What did he say?
3/7/20, 7:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: Also either way I'll still take a democrat in cognitive decline over Trump in cognitive decline
3/7/20, 7:51 PM - Alex Starr: Holy shit Jojo Rabbit took a turn
3/7/20, 7:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: Parker I can’t find a vid
3/7/20, 8:04 PM - Parker: Idk if it was a press conference but it was some interview and he stumbled multiple times and had to apologize
3/7/20, 8:05 PM - Parker: I also have read about stuff that warrens policies align more with bernie so her endorsing bernie would be big
3/7/20, 8:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’ve seen some videos of Biden gaffing it’s bad
3/7/20, 8:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: But he’s still a better shot of beating trump than Bernie according to the numbers
3/7/20, 8:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: Which better than our very bias intuitions imo
3/7/20, 8:12 PM - Tim Ko: He said o’Biden bama lol
3/7/20, 8:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lol wtf I watched it
3/7/20, 8:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: People cheered anyway
3/7/20, 8:14 PM - Collin Hurst: Link?
3/7/20, 8:16 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah and he was like, “we can only re elect trump”
3/7/20, 8:16 PM - Tim Ko: "... We cannot get re-elect, we cannot win this re-election, excuse me. We can only re-elect Donald Trump,"
3/7/20, 8:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: https://twitter.com/RealSaavedra/status/1236437754772246528?s=20
3/7/20, 8:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: Here’s a conservative journalist’s tweet
3/7/20, 8:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: With the clip
3/7/20, 8:18 PM - Tim Ko: Maybe Biden can be a figurehead and bernie can call the shots if biden gets elected
3/7/20, 8:18 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’m just hoping he picks a cool vp
3/7/20, 8:18 PM - Jason Greenberg: But again the only goal is to get trump out of office
3/7/20, 8:19 PM - Jason Greenberg: Any democratic option is better so it makes sense to pick the one with the best chance
3/7/20, 8:20 PM - Darren: Biden gets Obama for his VP
3/7/20, 8:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lool
3/7/20, 8:21 PM - Alex Starr: Then dies

3/8/20, 11:34 AM - Alex Starr: I liked parasite a little better I’d say
3/8/20, 3:21 PM - Parker: Damn apparently that clip of biden saying all that stuff yesterday was edited and not true
3/8/20, 3:21 PM - Parker: and most likely edited by someone on trumps team
3/8/20, 3:27 PM - Matt Casali: Classic
3/8/20, 3:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh waat
3/8/20, 3:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: The obiden bama?

3/9/20, 1:43 PM - Darren: Alex / Tim, I hear Berkeley is suspending all in person classes?
3/9/20, 1:43 PM - Alex Starr: Flattery will get you no where
3/9/20, 1:43 PM - Alex Starr: I didn’t hear that
3/9/20, 1:43 PM - Alex Starr: But will now check my email
3/9/20, 1:44 PM - Parker: Lol
3/9/20, 1:45 PM - Alex Starr: You are correct
3/9/20, 1:45 PM - Alex Starr: Debating whether to go home or ignore the restrictions entirely
3/9/20, 1:46 PM - Darren: And go to classes that aren't being held?
3/9/20, 1:46 PM - Alex Starr: Not that but they are also doing stuff about events and working
3/9/20, 1:47 PM - Vaughn: ^^power move
3/9/20, 1:47 PM - Alex Starr: Lack of office hours is going to make everything so much harder

3/9/20, 1:58 PM - Collin Hurst: What is office hours?
3/9/20, 1:58 PM - Alex Starr: Also kinda crazy that we’ve now missed class for fires, power outages, and disease.
3/9/20, 1:59 PM - Alex Starr: Where people go when Chegg isnt good enough for the problems you need to solve
3/9/20, 1:59 PM - Matt Casali: It's happening
3/9/20, 2:00 PM - Darren: And UCSC has had an intense strike the whole quarter

3/9/20, 2:03 PM - Darren: San Andreas is due for 1 8.x earthquake every hundred years
3/9/20, 2:04 PM - Tim Ko: Yup
3/9/20, 2:04 PM - Darren: Or a 6.x-7.x every 10 years
3/9/20, 2:04 PM - Tim Ko: Labs aren’t canceled yet tho thank goodness
3/9/20, 2:04 PM - Tim Ko: I need to graduate
3/9/20, 2:04 PM - Alex Starr: I’m more concerned about OH
3/9/20, 2:04 PM - Darren: The idea is that the longer it takes for the next earthquake to come, the bigger it will be because more energy will be stored up on the fault line
3/9/20, 2:04 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz I hate doing hw
3/9/20, 2:06 PM - Matt Casali: I'd be so stoked cause then I get a take home final

3/9/20, 2:08 PM - Parker: so we’re due due
3/9/20, 2:08 PM - Matt Casali: Its gonna be a beeeeeg one
3/9/20, 2:08 PM - Darren: Luckily the San Andreas fault near us is structured in such a way that it's only gonna be like a 7.x max
3/9/20, 2:08 PM - Darren: Which will still suck, but
3/9/20, 2:08 PM - Matt Casali: Still sucks
3/9/20, 2:08 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah
3/9/20, 2:10 PM - Matt Casali: I wonder how the government's planning for that
3/9/20, 2:26 PM - Tim Ko: It’s ok, worst case u sell ur land here and with that money can buy a mansion in the middle of rurual Utah
3/9/20, 2:27 PM - Darren: You could sell your car and buy a mansion in rural Utah
3/9/20, 2:27 PM - Darren: You could sell your textbook you bought for a GE and buy a mansion in rural utah

3/9/20, 6:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
3/9/20, 6:58 PM - Alex Starr: Someone should get out in front and make “I survived corona virus” shirts.  They’d make a killing.
3/9/20, 7:01 PM - Tim Ko: Hahah
3/9/20, 7:30 PM - Alex Starr: But the real key is to corner the market on carving “I didn’t survive corona virus” on tombstones and make “I survived corona virus twice” shirts after infecting the first line of shirts with corona virus.
3/9/20, 7:32 PM - Alex Starr: Proceed inductively from there
3/9/20, 7:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
3/9/20, 7:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: This is some haas shit

3/9/20, 8:59 PM - Matt Casali: It was when I went to the beach and smoked and it was like the only time except for once before that I smoked during the day/outside
3/9/20, 8:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: Day time is fun
3/9/20, 8:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: Outside is fun too
3/9/20, 9:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: Did we do the two bowls thing?
3/9/20, 9:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: Am I not remembering because we succeeded?
3/9/20, 9:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: +two bowls*
3/9/20, 9:03 PM - Alex Starr: Considering we haven’t buried Collin with “plus two bowls” as his epitaph, I’m gonna day no
3/9/20, 9:32 PM - Parker: Last time i was in SC we definitely did plus two bowls
3/9/20, 9:32 PM - Parker: you had to leave earlier that night bc of your trip :(

3/9/20, 10:42 PM - Parker: About to have more bowls than bol bol

3/9/20, 10:44 PM - Parker: Damn i take it back then
3/9/20, 10:45 PM - Ricky: I was gonna say, we got blasted, but deff wasn’t plus 2
3/9/20, 10:45 PM - Collin Hurst: We got enough to do it
3/9/20, 10:45 PM - Collin Hurst: I bought an oz for 60 and it turned out to be 1.2 oz lol

At the minimum”
3/9/20, 11:13 PM - Ricky: 👀👀👀
3/9/20, 11:13 PM - Jason Greenberg: !!
3/9/20, 11:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: I am free those days
3/9/20, 11:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: But I’m still in SoCal
3/9/20, 11:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: I said I would probably come back to NorCal the 21st but it turned out Hayley didn’t get back from her trip until the 20th so I’m gonna spend time with her through the 22nd
3/9/20, 11:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: If you’re trying to hang in SoCal on the 18th or 19th I’m v down
3/9/20, 11:16 PM - Parker: Booooo
3/9/20, 11:16 PM - Parker: Spend time with her on the backend foo
3/9/20, 11:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: I can’t she’s going to Vegas
3/9/20, 11:17 PM - Ricky: It’s k

3/9/20, 11:17 PM - Ricky: ❤
3/9/20, 11:18 PM - Jason Greenberg: Buckle your asshairs to the deck for cards against humanity this break
3/9/20, 11:18 PM - Jason Greenberg: It’s coming at you hard
3/9/20, 11:18 PM - Jason Greenberg: Im gonna need some help cutting up the cards again from someone
3/9/20, 11:18 PM - Jason Greenberg: Or someones
3/9/20, 11:24 PM - Parker: let’s gooooo
3/10/20, 9:37 AM - Parker: My mans joe is slipping
3/10/20, 9:38 AM - Parker: did you guys see him chew out that michigan worker this morning?
3/10/20, 9:38 AM - Parker: https://twitter.com/steveguest/status/1237388457359691776?s=21
3/10/20, 9:58 AM - Jason Greenberg: Damn not great
3/10/20, 9:58 AM - Jason Greenberg: Still better than trump
3/10/20, 10:03 AM - Parker: Beatable though?
3/10/20, 10:04 AM - Parker: i’m doubting it more and more everyday
3/10/20, 10:06 AM - Jason Greenberg: If not beatable, more competitive than Bernie
3/10/20, 10:07 AM - Jason Greenberg: So if you had to play a hand that is your choice
3/10/20, 10:07 AM - Jason Greenberg: I’m with you tho overall Democrats not looking good
3/10/20, 10:08 AM - Parker: idk
3/10/20, 10:08 AM - Parker: it’s like no ones learned anything the last four years
3/10/20, 10:09 AM - Alex Starr: I think this pessimism is ill-advises
3/10/20, 10:09 AM - Alex Starr: Advised
3/10/20, 10:09 AM - Parker: It’s just still a little surprising to me even though it probably shouldn’t be
3/10/20, 10:10 AM - Alex Starr: Right but helping to generate excitement around Biden and defeating trump improves our chances
3/10/20, 10:10 AM - Alex Starr: Fatalism doesn’t win elections
3/10/20, 10:10 AM - Parker: But far bigger emphasis on the second part
3/10/20, 10:11 AM - Parker: which i don’t think people are putting enough emphasis on rn
3/10/20, 10:11 AM - Alex Starr: Excitement for Biden is just as good
3/10/20, 10:11 AM - Alex Starr: Or better if it motivates people to vote
3/10/20, 10:12 AM - Parker: true
3/10/20, 10:12 AM - Alex Starr: Should do everything we can to win and assume that we will win until we’ve lost.  Then should we lose (which we wont) surrender gracefully.
3/10/20, 10:13 AM - Darren: Alexander Starr 2032
3/10/20, 10:15 AM - Parker: ^
3/10/20, 10:27 AM - Jason Greenberg: Biden will win the primary we need to get behind him
3/10/20, 10:27 AM - Jason Greenberg: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-forecast/
3/10/20, 11:07 AM - Tim Ko: GANG
3/10/20, 11:08 AM - Darren: UCSC is suspending all in person classes starting tomorrow
3/10/20, 11:09 AM - Darren: All finals will be online
3/10/20, 11:09 AM - Parker: Dangggg
3/10/20, 11:09 AM - Ricky: Holly shot
3/10/20, 11:10 AM - Darren: It would have been incredibly clutch if they cancelled classes today tho
3/10/20, 11:10 AM - Darren: The strike pushed back Vaughn and my AI exam from Thursday->today
3/10/20, 11:11 AM - Vaughn: Gdi
3/10/20, 11:11 AM - Vaughn: Back to studying
3/10/20, 11:13 AM - Darren: Good luck
3/10/20, 11:23 AM - Matt Casali: Bernies better than trump
3/10/20, 11:23 AM - Darren: You're not wrong
3/10/20, 11:23 AM - Matt Casali: Just saw that wow
3/10/20, 11:23 AM - Vaughn: Corona > Cola
3/10/20, 11:24 AM - Darren: Corola
3/10/20, 11:24 AM - Matt Casali: The real plague
3/10/20, 11:35 AM - Jason Greenberg: It’s true
3/10/20, 11:35 AM - Jason Greenberg: It’s raining today
3/10/20, 11:36 AM - Matt Casali: and he isnt mentally breaking down and he beats trump in polls and he has good policies
3/10/20, 11:37 AM - Matt Casali: Js
3/10/20, 11:37 AM - Jason Greenberg: 2/3 of those 3 claims I’d agree with
3/10/20, 11:37 AM - Jason Greenberg: Js
3/10/20, 11:37 AM - Matt Casali: Which ones?
3/10/20, 11:37 AM - Jason Greenberg: The beats trump in polls for overall presidency I haven’t seen anywhere reputable
3/10/20, 11:37 AM - Matt Casali: I sent you one
3/10/20, 11:38 AM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
3/10/20, 11:38 AM - Jason Greenberg: It wasn’t reputable
3/10/20, 11:38 AM - Jason Greenberg: Those aren’t independent news organizations
3/10/20, 11:38 AM - Jason Greenberg: And the margin of error wasn’t stated so you can’t interpret them
3/10/20, 11:38 AM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
3/10/20, 11:39 AM - Jason Greenberg: Independent
3/10/20, 11:39 AM - Jason Greenberg: This is literally posted by the candidate
3/10/20, 11:39 AM - Matt Casali: I mean the source is there though
3/10/20, 11:39 AM - Jason Greenberg: It uses the same sources you used it looks like
3/10/20, 11:40 AM - Jason Greenberg: Bro come on if I sad China says they don’t actually monitor its people look the Chinese media says so
3/10/20, 11:40 AM - Jason Greenberg: said*
3/10/20, 11:41 AM - Jason Greenberg: And then if I showed you a bunch of biased probably politically motivated polls that said China doesn’t monitor it citizens
3/10/20, 11:41 AM - Jason Greenberg: Would you believe the claim?
3/10/20, 11:42 AM - Matt Casali: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/02/28/opinion/bernie-sanders-polls.amp.html
3/10/20, 11:42 AM - Jason Greenberg: Wait it’s the exact same poll
3/10/20, 11:42 AM - Jason Greenberg: The Bernie tweet
3/10/20, 11:42 AM - Matt Casali: No yeah I just realized that haha
3/10/20, 11:44 AM - Darren: Does anyone know what's up with Hong Kong right now?
3/10/20, 11:44 AM - Jason Greenberg: The first poll that article used is the same one you sent originally
3/10/20, 11:44 AM - Matt Casali: Okay then what polls are you using to show that biden beats trump?
3/10/20, 11:44 AM - Matt Casali: I couldn't find anything on pew research
3/10/20, 11:46 AM - Jason Greenberg: Five thirty eight
3/10/20, 11:46 AM - Jason Greenberg: And another I sent earlier about swing stares
3/10/20, 11:46 AM - Jason Greenberg: states
3/10/20, 11:47 AM - Matt Casali: Can you send?
3/10/20, 11:47 AM - Jason Greenberg: Five thirty eight is aggregates independent polling agency data and lets you adjust what is displayed by the reputability of the source
3/10/20, 11:47 AM - Jason Greenberg: I literally did
3/10/20, 11:48 AM - Matt Casali: Didnt see that sorry
3/10/20, 11:50 AM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
3/10/20, 11:51 AM - Jason Greenberg: It was Super Tuesday
3/10/20, 11:51 AM - Jason Greenberg: That’s what changed the graph
3/10/20, 11:51 AM - Jason Greenberg: There’s no conspiracy here
3/10/20, 11:52 AM - Darren: Wasn't Biden doing really shitty until super Tuesday, which would explain the dip and the resurgence?
3/10/20, 11:52 AM - Jason Greenberg: They literally froze the projection until all the votes had been counted
3/10/20, 11:52 AM - Jason Greenberg: Yes
3/10/20, 11:52 AM - Matt Casali: I mean my main point in all of this is that an establishment Democrat lost to trump last year because of disillusionment with the establishment. I think it's really foolish to think its gonna work this time
3/10/20, 11:52 AM - Matt Casali: Even with this covid19 fiasco
3/10/20, 11:52 AM - Jason Greenberg: I think you have to play the game more than you think
3/10/20, 11:53 AM - Jason Greenberg: I like Bernie and I like most of his policies
3/10/20, 11:53 AM - Jason Greenberg: More than joes
3/10/20, 11:53 AM - Jason Greenberg: So if trump didn’t exist and it was between joe and Bernie I’d vote Bernie easily
3/10/20, 11:53 AM - Jason Greenberg: But I’m trying to be pragmatic based on the numbers and keep my ego out of it
3/10/20, 11:54 AM - Matt Casali: Ah yes
3/10/20, 11:54 AM - Matt Casali: Me too
3/10/20, 11:54 AM - Jason Greenberg: ?
3/10/20, 11:54 AM - Matt Casali: I'm trying to look at our past experience in the last election and keep my ego out of it
3/10/20, 11:55 AM - Jason Greenberg: I don’t think your strategy works
3/10/20, 11:55 AM - Jason Greenberg: But it won’t matter much longer in my prediction
3/10/20, 11:56 AM - Matt Casali: Also, I'd like to call into question the validity of polls in general
3/10/20, 11:56 AM - Matt Casali: Most polls in 2016 had Clinton beating trump
3/10/20, 11:56 AM - Jason Greenberg: Source? How far out?
3/10/20, 11:57 AM - Jason Greenberg: Also polls are absolutely fallible
3/10/20, 11:57 AM - Matt Casali: So why are you basing your entire vote on it?
3/10/20, 11:58 AM - Jason Greenberg: But like looking at a distant weather forecast for a vacation, I’d prefer to use it as a guide for how I prepare instead of trusting my gut about whether it’s going to rain or not
3/10/20, 11:59 AM - Matt Casali: That's not a good analogy imo
3/10/20, 12:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: Without an advanced political science degree I don’t think I’m gonna come up with the winner
3/10/20, 12:00 PM - Darren: Lmao "advanced" political science degree
3/10/20, 12:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: Bachelor ain’t shit
3/10/20, 12:01 PM - Matt Casali: Our ability to predict weather is grounded in a much better understanding of the weather than our ability to predict people which we have very little understanding of
3/10/20, 12:01 PM - Darren: Bottom line: we need a Foundation
3/10/20, 12:01 PM - Matt Casali: Yes thank you for being the only person who understands me
3/10/20, 12:02 PM - Jason Greenberg: It’s more to point out that things are unpredictable in the future but it’s the best data we have on how people will vote
3/10/20, 12:03 PM - Matt Casali: Okay but taking into account how erroneous that data is paired with the fact that you dont ever go on a trip without packing for a broad range of weather
3/10/20, 12:03 PM - Matt Casali: Again it's not the best analogy
3/10/20, 12:04 PM - Darren: I bring a light jacket at best
3/10/20, 12:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ok not the best analogy
3/10/20, 12:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: It’s you either bring an artic jacket or a tank top
3/10/20, 12:05 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah herd aside cause some of you guys suck at packing
3/10/20, 12:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: And you have to decide 6 months out
3/10/20, 12:05 PM - Darren: Matt you're a hoe
3/10/20, 12:05 PM - Vaughn: Whats up?
3/10/20, 12:09 PM - Matt Casali: I dont think that's a good analogy either, the difference between bernie and biden is not the big
3/10/20, 12:09 PM - Matt Casali: Well maybe it is
3/10/20, 12:09 PM - Matt Casali: Cause biden is suffering from a slow brain death
3/10/20, 12:10 PM - Darren: Bernie knows that fear is the mindkiller - the little death
3/10/20, 12:11 PM - Alex Starr: Really? I’d vote joe over Bernie
3/10/20, 12:13 PM - Alex Starr: Nice
3/10/20, 12:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: Idea logically I like Bernie
3/10/20, 12:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: I don’t like universal health care but I don’t think that would pass
3/10/20, 12:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: I also don’t think a wealth tax would pass so not worried about that
3/10/20, 12:22 PM - Jason Greenberg: But Bernie cares more about the environment as far as I can tel
3/10/20, 12:22 PM - Matt Casali: I agree with the last one
3/10/20, 12:23 PM - Alex Starr: I haven’t gotten that impression
3/10/20, 12:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: Maybe it’s easier for me to jump ship because my #1 got out early
3/10/20, 12:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yang gang forever
3/10/20, 12:24 PM - Alex Starr: One point in favor of Biden is that Bernie did not get young people to vote on Super Tuesday.
3/10/20, 12:24 PM - Darren: Andrew Yang looks exactly like Mr negative from Spiderman PS4
3/10/20, 12:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
3/10/20, 12:24 PM - Alex Starr: In my mind sanders gets bogged down in the other shit and fails to accomplish stuff with climate change
3/10/20, 12:24 PM - Matt Casali: 🤔
3/10/20, 12:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: Can I get a pic of that
3/10/20, 12:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: Well I see your rationale then
3/10/20, 12:26 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
3/10/20, 12:26 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
3/10/20, 12:26 PM - Matt Casali: Like not at all haha
3/10/20, 12:27 PM - Alex Starr: But if you had to pick a marvel villain...
3/10/20, 12:27 PM - Darren: Ok, I was remembering the Mr negative version
3/10/20, 12:27 PM - Darren: <Media omitted>
3/10/20, 12:27 PM - Matt Casali: Hmmm
3/10/20, 12:27 PM - Darren: which again is not exact, but I just really like the picture of Andrew Yang being Mr Negative
3/10/20, 12:27 PM - Darren: especially since his backstory is almost exactly Mr Negative's backstory in the game
3/10/20, 12:28 PM - Matt Casali: How so
3/10/20, 12:32 PM - Ricky: Wait that’s so true Hahahah
3/10/20, 12:32 PM - Darren: Yang was doing pretty well in private sector business and then decided to go full time into working with (founding?) a non-prof to help people impacted by the great recession. He then decided to keep campaigning in order to help the poor and distribute freedom dividends to the poor. Ultimately, he got fucked over by some billionaire comic bad guy from NYC.

Mr. Negative also left private sector business to focus on a non-profit (homeless shelter) and is the most sincere and nice guy. He donates money to help poor people and Spiderman really respects him. He got fucked over by Osborne, a billionaire comic bad guy from NYC, and aims to take his revenge on that billionaire
3/10/20, 12:32 PM - Darren: Also they are both asian, have a gang, and can glow in the dark
3/10/20, 12:34 PM - Alex Starr: It’s the last bit that seals it
3/10/20, 12:36 PM - Alex Starr: Although if Tom Holland is a yang supporter...
3/10/20, 12:36 PM - Darren: Tom Holland is British
3/10/20, 12:36 PM - Alex Starr: Doesn’t mean he can’t support yang
3/10/20, 12:37 PM - Alex Starr: Unless the British are massively racist
3/10/20, 12:37 PM - Darren: Well
3/10/20, 12:37 PM - Alex Starr: So I concede
3/10/20, 12:38 PM - Alex Starr: Unrelated, I’m in lecture
3/10/20, 12:38 PM - Darren: I thought that was illegal
3/10/20, 12:39 PM - Alex Starr: Eecs disagrees
3/10/20, 12:40 PM - Alex Starr: As does Ben Hoberman apparently
3/10/20, 12:56 PM - Tim Ko: Damn Santa Clara county banned gatherings of over 1000 ppl
3/10/20, 12:56 PM - Tim Ko: Doesn’t affect the sharks tho, as they draw around 900 fans a game
3/10/20, 12:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha
3/10/20, 1:01 PM - Vaughn: Lol
3/10/20, 1:10 PM - Matt Casali: Hahaha
3/10/20, 1:55 PM - Alex Starr: Oh shit Berkeley grad students (non stem and a random chemistry) going on strike
3/10/20, 2:20 PM - Collin Hurst: Hot take: Zoom created corona virus
3/10/20, 2:21 PM - Tim Ko: Damn
3/10/20, 2:21 PM - Tim Ko: Explain
3/10/20, 2:25 PM - Collin Hurst: Cause everyone is using zoom now that we have to meet online
3/10/20, 2:30 PM - Ricky: I wonder if this will lower A’s ticket prices 👀
3/10/20, 2:31 PM - Tim Ko: Oooo maybe
3/10/20, 2:31 PM - Tim Ko: Warriors tickets selling for 30$ now
3/10/20, 2:31 PM - Matt Casali: Go any lower and they'd be paying us to go to the game
3/10/20, 2:31 PM - Tim Ko: lmao good one
3/10/20, 2:31 PM - Tim Ko: ?
3/10/20, 2:32 PM - Ricky: I’m going with Netflix, pple aren’t doing work, they just wanna watch tv
3/10/20, 2:55 PM - Alex Starr: I’d go if it was profitable for me
3/10/20, 2:55 PM - Alex Starr: Budweiser
3/10/20, 2:56 PM - Alex Starr: Just wait until the Miller Lite plague and Busch fungus come
3/10/20, 2:56 PM - Parker: hey man i did them for my industry analysis class don’t shit on my company
3/10/20, 3:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: UCSB is going remote as of tomorrow
3/10/20, 3:16 PM - Darren: Angel list sent me an email recommending I apply to all the remote work companies like zoom or tandem
3/10/20, 5:37 PM - Alex Starr: Corona virus upside #3: dining hall is pretty empty
3/10/20, 5:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lol
3/10/20, 5:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: Is anyone going home?
3/10/20, 5:53 PM - Alex Starr: My sister did faster than I thought possible
3/10/20, 5:53 PM - Alex Starr: But I’m not.  Research
3/10/20, 5:54 PM - Alex Starr: Plus my eecs prof gives 0 fucks and is stil lecturing and lecture is better in person
3/10/20, 6:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lol
3/10/20, 6:10 PM - Tim Ko: Haha
3/10/20, 6:11 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah I’m prob gonna head home tomorrow
3/10/20, 6:21 PM - Alex Starr: My brother left within 2 hours of hearing UCSC was canceling classes
3/10/20, 6:24 PM - Tim Ko: Lmao
3/10/20, 6:26 PM - Alex Starr: Are other UCSC people heading home? It sounds like they point blank said to go home unless you have very important stuff to do.
3/10/20, 6:30 PM - Collin Hurst: I don’t think I’d be any safer at home , and I’d be bored af
3/10/20, 6:30 PM - Alex Starr: You’d def be safer at home
3/10/20, 6:30 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah just don’t go to el Camino hospital
3/10/20, 6:31 PM - Alex Starr: Your level of safety is inversely correlated with the number of girls named chloe in your radius
3/10/20, 6:31 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
3/10/20, 6:33 PM - Collin Hurst: I also would risk giving it to my parents which I don’t want
3/10/20, 6:33 PM - Matt Casali: I just realized he was saying he supports the second amendment haha
3/10/20, 6:34 PM - Matt Casali: Didnt watch it the first time through
3/10/20, 6:34 PM - Matt Casali: Same
3/10/20, 6:34 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah nuances for sure
3/10/20, 6:35 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz he understands gun control isn’t as important as many other issues and more restrictive gun laws aren’t worth the political capital they’d require to pass.
3/10/20, 6:35 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah, tho I doubt u have it unless there are cases at ucsc
3/10/20, 6:35 PM - Alex Starr: But heading home is likely the safer option for everyone by a wide margin
3/10/20, 6:35 PM - Alex Starr: I just have research
3/10/20, 6:36 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah I’m not sure if going to Barcelona is the best move
3/10/20, 6:36 PM - Tim Ko: But yolo
3/10/20, 6:36 PM - Tim Ko: I’ll just stay away from my parents after I return
3/10/20, 6:36 PM - Matt Casali: That's not what he said lol
3/10/20, 6:36 PM - Alex Starr: I didn’t watch it in the slightest
3/10/20, 6:36 PM - Matt Casali: He's like oh boy I have guns and I like them too!
3/10/20, 6:37 PM - Alex Starr: Well...
3/10/20, 6:37 PM - Alex Starr: That’s exactly what I said haha
3/10/20, 6:37 PM - Vaughn: If we all get corona virus this week, we'll be healthy and immune by the time we leave for paris yeah?
3/10/20, 6:37 PM - Alex Starr: Unless it mutates
3/10/20, 6:37 PM - Vaughn: Damn
3/10/20, 6:38 PM - Alex Starr: And I don’t think they do travel restrictions based on “was crazy enough to infect themselves
3/10/20, 6:38 PM - Alex Starr: That said it’s France so who knows
3/10/20, 6:42 PM - Vaughn: Lool
3/10/20, 6:42 PM - Vaughn: Damn what would you say the odds of our trip getting cancelled?
3/10/20, 7:00 PM - Alex Starr: No idea
3/10/20, 7:00 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah just gotta wait and see
3/10/20, 7:00 PM - Tim Ko: Shall we do an Idaho back up plan?
3/10/20, 7:01 PM - Alex Starr: Fuck no
3/10/20, 7:01 PM - Alex Starr: There’s no reason to go anywhere not on a coast of the us
3/10/20, 7:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: How do you figure
3/10/20, 7:13 PM - Tim Ko: Haha
3/10/20, 7:13 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’m interested in being convinced
3/10/20, 7:19 PM - Tim Ko: Say u got three roomates, they all are exposed to more ppl
3/10/20, 7:20 PM - Tim Ko: Where as at home it with just ur parents who don’t go around class to class
3/10/20, 7:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: I mean there’s no more classes
3/10/20, 7:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: But I do have 5 roommates
3/10/20, 7:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: But if we’re just talking about safety there’s no known cases in sb and 40 in Santa Clara country
3/10/20, 7:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: county
3/10/20, 7:58 PM - Matt Casali: Specifically some degree of exposure at el Camino hospital
3/10/20, 8:18 PM - Parker: ^
3/10/20, 8:19 PM - Parker: Yeah for me it’s be safer to stay bc there’s no known cases here and just in case my parents somehow got in contact
3/10/20, 8:19 PM - Darren: IV probably has something worse just going around
3/10/20, 8:19 PM - Darren: Call it TKE
3/10/20, 8:25 PM - Collin Hurst: One of Darren/My class will officially be all online next quarter
3/10/20, 8:25 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah for UCSB I think it could be different
3/10/20, 8:26 PM - Darren: My other classes were gonna be online only anyway without corola
3/10/20, 8:26 PM - Darren: Corona
3/10/20, 8:41 PM - Alex Starr: So now all of them are online?
3/10/20, 8:43 PM - Parker: that’s lit
3/10/20, 8:43 PM - Parker: Come live with me for the spring darren
3/10/20, 8:43 PM - Parker: I’m actually might need to look for a roommate😂😂
3/10/20, 8:44 PM - Parker: i actually*
3/10/20, 10:01 PM - Ricky: https://youtu.be/E3URhJx0NSw

3/11/20, 12:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: <Media omitted>
3/11/20, 12:12 PM - Ricky: Any advise y’all got from kids who have online classes?
3/11/20, 12:12 PM - Ricky: People kinda flipping they shit her
3/11/20, 12:22 PM - Alex Starr: 1.5x speed is your friend, 2x speed is your enemy
3/11/20, 12:22 PM - Vaughn: ^this
3/11/20, 12:23 PM - Vaughn: Dont let your webcasts pile up too much
3/11/20, 12:24 PM - Alex Starr: It’s hard to do, but pretend like you have to go to lecture anyway.
3/11/20, 12:25 PM - Alex Starr: And above all, mute your goddamn mic when you join zoom.
3/11/20, 12:26 PM - Vaughn: ^!
3/11/20, 12:26 PM - Vaughn: My friend forgot to mute their mic
3/11/20, 12:26 PM - Vaughn: Their class of 50 got to hear me talking about my ducks liking my smelly feet
3/11/20, 12:27 PM - Tim Ko: Also make sure ur landlord isn’t showing ppl around ur apartment if ur teaching a class
3/11/20, 12:27 PM - Tim Ko: And close ur bathroom door when u shower
3/11/20, 12:28 PM - Vaughn: Facecam off during showers too
3/11/20, 12:30 PM - Alex Starr: Someone was loudly saying something that, without context, seemed like they were shit talking our professor who had at that point lectured for a total of 20 minutes all semester
3/11/20, 1:02 PM - Ricky: Thnx bois
3/11/20, 1:02 PM - Ricky: Also, eric dyer works for the A’s media team now!!!!!!! @16502796204
3/11/20, 1:07 PM - Parker: that’s dope!!
3/11/20, 1:07 PM - Parker: they’re announcing here today whether they’re cancelling or making finals online or not
3/11/20, 1:07 PM - Parker: My fingers are crossed lol
3/11/20, 1:13 PM - Alex Starr: Idk how you can prevent cheating if finals are online but cancelling is worse
3/11/20, 1:15 PM - Vaughn: Online finals are a mess
3/11/20, 1:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’ve got one coming up with ProctorU
3/11/20, 1:50 PM - Parker: Yeah he said ours is gonna be online
3/11/20, 1:50 PM - Parker: they’re supposedly sending out a university wide thing later today announcing everything
3/11/20, 1:50 PM - Parker: and there’s a chance classes are remote next term too which would suck cock
3/11/20, 1:51 PM - Matt Casali: Our first week of next quarter is remote
3/11/20, 1:51 PM - Matt Casali: I am absolutely dreading what that means for my physics final
3/11/20, 2:06 PM - Darren: Cancelling finals would be so clutch
3/11/20, 2:07 PM - Parker: Speak for yourself haha
3/11/20, 2:10 PM - Matt Casali: I agree cause somehow I'm actually doing well in physics this quarter and a final might just lower my grade
3/11/20, 2:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: Big cocks boiii
3/11/20, 2:25 PM - Tim Ko: Woahhhh what does he do??
3/11/20, 2:26 PM - Ricky: Idk, he wasn’t clear about it but seems like he does media coverage like tv stuff
3/11/20, 2:27 PM - Parker: March madness announced no fans allowed the whole tournament😳😲
3/11/20, 2:27 PM - Parker: That’s insane
3/11/20, 2:28 PM - Tim Ko: Damnnnnn that’s dope
3/11/20, 2:28 PM - Tim Ko: We can go to an A’s game and heckle him
3/11/20, 2:28 PM - Tim Ko: Damnnnnn
3/11/20, 2:28 PM - Tim Ko: Warriors game tonight no fans
3/11/20, 2:28 PM - Parker: that’s sick, that’s kinda what he did for the red sox right?
3/11/20, 2:28 PM - Tim Ko: I had tickets :(
3/11/20, 2:28 PM - Parker: Stfu haha
3/11/20, 2:29 PM - Tim Ko: I actually did
3/11/20, 2:29 PM - Parker: I don’t believe you
3/11/20, 2:29 PM - Tim Ko: Why lol
3/11/20, 2:29 PM - Tim Ko: <Media omitted>
3/11/20, 2:29 PM - Parker: Idk seems like tim troll
3/11/20, 2:29 PM - Parker: Oh damn
3/11/20, 2:30 PM - Parker: Jk lol
3/11/20, 2:30 PM - Parker: do you get refunded?
3/11/20, 2:30 PM - Tim Ko: Idk probs
3/11/20, 2:30 PM - Parker: a tim troll*
3/11/20, 2:30 PM - Tim Ko: I was a little hesitant on going anyways
3/11/20, 2:30 PM - Tim Ko: But this was prob my las my chance to see chase at a cheap price
3/11/20, 2:32 PM - Parker: Damn yeah that actually sucks :(
3/11/20, 2:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: He’ll probably tell you
3/11/20, 2:32 PM - Parker: steph playing too
3/11/20, 2:32 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah I was looking forward to that
3/11/20, 2:32 PM - Tim Ko: Had a choice between last third and tomorrow
3/11/20, 2:33 PM - Tim Ko: Thurs
3/11/20, 2:33 PM - Tim Ko: Shoulda gone last thurs
3/11/20, 2:33 PM - Parker: Were you going with fam?
3/11/20, 2:33 PM - Tim Ko: Nah some friends
3/11/20, 2:33 PM - Parker: Dang
3/11/20, 2:55 PM - Alex Starr: Canceling finals means we don’t graduate.  Seems like a pretty bad option
3/11/20, 2:56 PM - Darren: I've heard of some professors who just decided to give the whole class As
3/11/20, 2:58 PM - Tim Ko: That’s dope lol
3/11/20, 3:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: Does it tho?
3/11/20, 3:28 PM - Alex Starr: Means I don’t.  I didn’t take any of my first midterms
3/11/20, 3:31 PM - Darren: That sounds like a you problem
3/11/20, 3:31 PM - Darren: The rest of us weren't too busy being goddamn intellectual rock stars to take our midterms
3/11/20, 3:33 PM - Tim Ko: Alex if u reject all ur acceptances, u can go through the process again and get free flights and drinks
3/11/20, 3:53 PM - Parker: ^
3/11/20, 3:53 PM - Parker: Not me haha
3/11/20, 4:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lol
3/11/20, 4:29 PM - Alex Starr: Don’t joke about that haha.  I’m very unsure of my decision
3/11/20, 4:29 PM - Alex Starr: That plus the covid plus having missed exams plus research shit happening is a lot
3/11/20, 4:30 PM - Alex Starr: And I was just admitted to stanford!
3/11/20, 4:30 PM - Parker: OH MY FUCKING GOD
3/11/20, 4:30 PM - Parker: ALEX
3/11/20, 4:31 PM - Parker: congrats!!
3/11/20, 4:31 PM - Alex Starr: It’s kinda been my goal since day 1 haha.  Not sure I’ll pick it but huge win for sure.  Thanks!
3/11/20, 4:36 PM - Tim Ko: Ayyyy DUDE CONGRATS MANNN
3/11/20, 4:36 PM - Tim Ko: LETS GOOOOO
3/11/20, 4:37 PM - Tim Ko: So now it’s between stanford and MIT huh
3/11/20, 4:37 PM - Tim Ko: U know where ur heart is alex, just do it, no regrets
3/11/20, 4:41 PM - Darren: And Berkeley
3/11/20, 4:41 PM - Darren: And UCSC and UCSD
3/11/20, 4:42 PM - Alex Starr: MIT Berkeley Stanford
3/11/20, 4:42 PM - Alex Starr: I’ve already replied to UCSC
3/11/20, 4:42 PM - Alex Starr: And UCSF has a very small chance I think
3/11/20, 4:43 PM - Parker: I know it has been and living with someone who has worked  there for 16 years i fully understand how insanely difficult it is to get in haha
3/11/20, 4:43 PM - Parker: Like that’s really awesome alex
3/11/20, 4:43 PM - Parker: Damn if only you had some decent options
3/11/20, 4:43 PM - Alex Starr: Lol
3/11/20, 4:44 PM - Alex Starr: From what I’ve heard, MIT and Berkeley seem to be thought of as the top programs along with the sub program I did in Stanford
3/11/20, 4:44 PM - Alex Starr: So that question did shit all for deciding haha
3/11/20, 4:45 PM - Parker: Also it’s official our first three weeks of next term are remote
3/11/20, 4:45 PM - Parker: and all finals will be online
3/11/20, 4:46 PM - Parker: Looks like pman has some time for a potential socal trip👀👀
3/11/20, 4:56 PM - Tim Ko: Alex lemme just tell u right now If u chose Berkeley over stanford you’d regret it 9 times out of 10.
3/11/20, 4:57 PM - Tim Ko: The only one time being if everyone in stanford died from corona virus
3/11/20, 5:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING
3/11/20, 5:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: CONGRATUFUCKINGLATIONS!!!
3/11/20, 5:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: That’s unbelievable!
3/11/20, 5:07 PM - Alex Starr: Thanks!
3/11/20, 5:09 PM - Alex Starr: Except Berkeley’s research fits me much better
3/11/20, 5:31 PM - Alex Starr: Plus Palo Alto is kinda boring
3/11/20, 5:35 PM - Matt Casali: Those are both good reasons
3/11/20, 5:35 PM - Matt Casali: But I think this is also true
3/11/20, 5:38 PM - Ricky: CONGRATS ALEX HOLLY MOTHAFUCKINFUCK
3/11/20, 5:40 PM - Alex Starr: Thanks!
3/11/20, 6:59 PM - Alex Starr: Holy shit
3/11/20, 6:59 PM - Alex Starr: The same person was the voice of Jasmine and Mulan singing wise
3/11/20, 7:02 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
3/11/20, 7:36 PM - Tim Ko: NBA season cancelled
3/11/20, 7:36 PM - Tim Ko: For now
3/11/20, 7:55 PM - Parker: I knowwwwwww
3/11/20, 7:55 PM - Parker: It’s all insane
3/11/20, 9:56 PM - Parker: Jason what’s your schedule like next week/where will you be when? i texted rick but i wanna try to come to socal for a couple days maybe!
3/11/20, 9:56 PM - Parker: My friend walker and i might drive down together bc he has other friends in socal if the timing works
3/11/20, 9:56 PM - Matt Casali: Aaaannddd make a stop at ucsc
3/11/20, 9:57 PM - Parker: We already got two in the schedule boi
3/11/20, 9:57 PM - Parker: Right?
3/11/20, 9:58 PM - Matt Casali: I guess spring break does count haha
3/11/20, 9:58 PM - Matt Casali: But what's the other one?
3/11/20, 9:58 PM - Parker: Darren’s bday? or is that in MV?
3/11/20, 9:58 PM - Parker: But yes i will try to come to sc too that week
3/11/20, 9:59 PM - Parker: When are you guys coming home?

3/11/20, 10:01 PM - Parker: Coo
3/11/20, 10:13 PM - Jason Greenberg: Boi I’m gonna try to come home to mv on Friday
3/11/20, 10:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: So I’ll be gone :(
3/11/20, 10:19 PM - Parker: Like this friday?
3/11/20, 10:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah
3/11/20, 11:02 PM - Parker: Aw dang
3/11/20, 11:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: When are you going down?
3/11/20, 11:56 PM - Parker: nothings set yet and i’m not for sure going i just thought it’d be fun since i had the extra time
3/12/20, 9:24 AM - Jason Greenberg: I gotcha
3/12/20, 10:42 AM - Parker: NHL suspended too
3/12/20, 10:42 AM - Parker: for the sharks sake, probably a good thing
3/12/20, 2:32 PM - Darren: Chanti's IG story is of one of those "shove-a-crystal-up-your-vag-to-inspire-spirituality" style posts, this time flavored towards enlightened solutions to corona.
3/12/20, 2:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: oh god
3/12/20, 2:32 PM - Darren: I skipped to the line "are you ready to start walking on that rainbow bridge to the land of solutions?" and felt physical pain
3/12/20, 2:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: <Media omitted>
3/12/20, 2:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: Wtf does "it's a potent time to be on this planet" mean
3/12/20, 2:37 PM - Vaughn: 👃
3/12/20, 2:38 PM - Alex Starr: Ngl sounds similar to what Matt was saying (not chanti’s thing, the other thing).
3/12/20, 2:41 PM - Tim Ko: Haha
3/12/20, 2:41 PM - Tim Ko: Chanti too woke for us
3/12/20, 2:58 PM - Parker: 💀💀
3/12/20, 3:00 PM - Matt Casali: I resent that
3/12/20, 3:01 PM - Alex Starr: Okay minus the rainbow bridge.  It has a similar sentiment I mean
3/12/20, 3:02 PM - Matt Casali: shove-a-crystal-up-your-vag-to-inepire-spirituality is a real thing haha it's crazy, juj told me there was a talk about it at LIB one year and it was really fucking weird
3/12/20, 3:02 PM - Matt Casali: Applied to a different situation
3/12/20, 3:02 PM - Alex Starr: Reminds me of linden hills
3/12/20, 3:02 PM - Darren: Those catfish tho
3/12/20, 3:06 PM - Matt Casali: It was basically that you stick the crystal in your vagina and it cleans all your bad vibes out
3/12/20, 3:07 PM - Darren: Seems like something she'd go to
3/12/20, 3:15 PM - Matt Casali: Very on brand I agree
3/12/20, 6:23 PM - Alex Starr: How does everyone like the online classes? I’m betting it’ll be like this the rest of the semester for us.
3/12/20, 6:24 PM - Darren: Quarter classes are prepping for finals so I haven't really noticed the online classes anyway
3/12/20, 6:24 PM - Alex Starr: That’s fair
3/12/20, 6:24 PM - Alex Starr: Shiftiest thing is oh and exams imo.  Online lecture is fine
3/12/20, 6:26 PM - Darren: And next quarter im only taking GEs so I really don't care if the quality of my education is hit by online - it's an absolute win
3/12/20, 6:27 PM - Parker: ^
3/12/20, 6:27 PM - Parker: starts next term for us
3/12/20, 6:27 PM - Darren: Vaughn and I went to campus to go to OH with our AI TA. I saw him at the coffee shop before our meeting, so I knew he was in the building. 

Right before our meeting, he sends us an email telling us that the professor just forbid him from seeing us in person... So we had a Google Hangout call with him from the same building
3/12/20, 6:29 PM - Alex Starr: Nice
3/12/20, 6:30 PM - Collin Hurst: Haha wtf
3/12/20, 6:30 PM - Alex Starr: I haven’t had to do OH yet because it somehow seems like more work for small stuff
3/12/20, 6:33 PM - Matt Casali: I hate being at home for the whole day but otherwise it hasn't really affected me too much
3/12/20, 6:34 PM - Matt Casali: Just less motivation to pay attention
3/12/20, 6:36 PM - Alex Starr: I walk around during lecture
3/12/20, 6:37 PM - Tim Ko: Temporarily I’m ok with it but wouldn’t wanna do it long term
3/12/20, 6:37 PM - Tim Ko: (Online lectures)
3/12/20, 6:37 PM - Matt Casali: But you're a chronic pacer haha, I'm surprised it doesn't happen in class already
3/12/20, 6:38 PM - Alex Starr: It’s frowned upon class
3/12/20, 6:39 PM - Alex Starr: In class
3/12/20, 6:39 PM - Alex Starr: And for bio lectures I can just barely type fast enough on mobile to keep up
3/12/20, 7:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lol
3/13/20, 12:39 AM - Alex Starr: In the ER cuz I damaged my esophagus.  It’ll heal apparently, but they gave me some throat numbing medicine and it is weird
3/13/20, 12:39 AM - Darren: How the fuck
3/13/20, 12:40 AM - Darren: Also, holy shit how are you feeling?
3/13/20, 12:40 AM - Alex Starr: Something I ate scratched it up.  Fine now that it’s numb.  Felt like something was lodged in it
3/13/20, 12:43 AM - Jason Greenberg: ER because of severity or to get seen generally?
3/13/20, 12:44 AM - Jason Greenberg: Did you eat a sharp tortilla chip?
3/13/20, 12:44 AM - Jason Greenberg: Sometimes those little assholes get stuck on the way down
3/13/20, 12:45 AM - Tim Ko: Wtf
3/13/20, 12:46 AM - Tim Ko: Everything ok??
3/13/20, 12:47 AM - Alex Starr: Severity and to get seen I guess.  Not very severe in actuality but it was bad enough there was no way I’d sleep
3/13/20, 12:48 AM - Jason Greenberg: I gotcha
3/13/20, 12:48 AM - Jason Greenberg: Sorry mang
3/13/20, 12:48 AM - Tim Ko: Damn dude
3/13/20, 12:48 AM - Tim Ko: Which ER are u at?
3/13/20, 12:50 AM - Alex Starr: Alta Bates back now tho
3/13/20, 1:20 AM - Tim Ko: Ahh ok nice
3/13/20, 1:28 AM - Parker: Dammnnnn
3/13/20, 1:28 AM - Parker: glad you’re okay
3/13/20, 9:07 AM - Matt Casali: Shit Alex, I'm sorry
3/13/20, 9:07 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah glad you're okay
3/13/20, 9:07 AM - Matt Casali: Sounds scary
3/13/20, 11:03 AM - Alex Starr: Upside is esophagus and mouth tissue is like the second fastest healing in the body I think
3/13/20, 11:13 AM - Tim Ko: Nice
3/13/20, 11:13 AM - Tim Ko: I see a deep threat joke being thrown in sometime in the future
3/13/20, 11:49 AM - Jason Greenberg: What’s the first
3/13/20, 2:19 PM - Collin Hurst: we should do another herd meme template

3/13/20, 5:12 PM - Collin Hurst: Sall good
3/13/20, 5:19 PM - Matt Casali: Phrasing
3/13/20, 5:30 PM - Alex Starr: Was trying to come up with something clever
3/13/20, 5:30 PM - Alex Starr: And I failed
3/13/20, 5:30 PM - Darren: Good try
3/13/20, 5:30 PM - Alex Starr: There had to be something their with posthaste, rectify, and submit
3/13/20, 5:32 PM - Alex Starr: I blame the lack of sleep
3/13/20, 5:53 PM - Darren: I just moved kiki out of his dorms
3/13/20, 5:53 PM - Darren: Feels weird
3/13/20, 5:54 PM - Alex Starr: He’s moving back permanently?
3/13/20, 5:54 PM - Alex Starr: My sister is planning on doing so and Ethan is going back to UCSC
3/13/20, 5:55 PM - Darren: Yeah
3/13/20, 5:57 PM - Alex Starr: My local Safeway was almost out of food.  They called me crazy for having a meal plan
3/13/20, 6:06 PM - Parker: the Trader Joe’s here was insane when i went
3/13/20, 6:06 PM - Parker: empty shelves everywhere
3/13/20, 6:09 PM - Alex Starr: Seems like an overreaction
3/13/20, 6:11 PM - Matt Casali: It definitely is
3/13/20, 6:12 PM - Tim Ko: Dudeeeee
3/13/20, 6:12 PM - Tim Ko: I saw a pic of it
3/13/20, 6:12 PM - Tim Ko: Looked like Venezuela
3/13/20, 6:12 PM - Matt Casali: My housemate bought $170 worth of stuff from tjs today
3/13/20, 6:12 PM - Matt Casali: Which is like the whole store
3/13/20, 6:12 PM - Alex Starr: Unless because everyone overreacted and you didn’t you don’t have food
3/13/20, 6:12 PM - Tim Ko: <Media omitted>
3/13/20, 6:12 PM - Tim Ko: <Media omitted>
3/13/20, 6:12 PM - Matt Casali: Holy fucj
3/13/20, 6:13 PM - Alex Starr: I just wanted tarte tatin ingredients
3/13/20, 6:13 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah but the people who did that are becoming the problem they're trying to protect themselves against haha
3/13/20, 6:13 PM - Matt Casali: But I understand it
3/13/20, 6:13 PM - Alex Starr: Better the problem and full than the solution and hungry
3/13/20, 6:13 PM - Matt Casali: I'm kind of tempted to do the same
3/13/20, 6:14 PM - Matt Casali: Hahaha
3/13/20, 6:14 PM - Alex Starr: They were out of cream for some reason
3/13/20, 6:14 PM - Matt Casali: Hey cats gotta eat too
3/13/20, 6:15 PM - Alex Starr: God if that’s the reason I’m actually mildly upset
3/13/20, 6:15 PM - Alex Starr: I could actually see it too
3/13/20, 6:16 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah it fits very well with the whole vibe rn
3/13/20, 6:16 PM - Matt Casali: I'm just glad that I dont have to pay for my own food in the next week for a little while
3/13/20, 6:18 PM - Alex Starr: Somewhat conveneiently I am social distancing proof because I don’t get out much anyway
3/13/20, 6:19 PM - Alex Starr: But I have to imagine depression rates will spike
3/13/20, 6:21 PM - Alex Starr: Plus my brother and sister will be fighting like cats whose owners didn’t steal my goddamn cream soon
3/13/20, 6:39 PM - Matt Casali: Classic Ethan and Kayla
3/13/20, 6:39 PM - Matt Casali: Always bickering, those two
3/13/20, 6:56 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah I bet, or just overall mood
3/13/20, 7:02 PM - Parker: 100%
3/13/20, 7:03 PM - Alex Starr: Plus my lab mates grad school visits were all canceled so she has so little info on the decision.  Has to pick a lab too
3/13/20, 7:10 PM - Tim Ko: *She* 😏
3/13/20, 7:11 PM - Alex Starr: At least your consistent

3/14/20, 4:52 PM - Collin Hurst: Wouldn’t be surprised
3/14/20, 4:52 PM - Collin Hurst: She has a lot of animals

3/14/20, 4:56 PM - Parker: Yeah i think she has a fuck ton of animals
3/14/20, 4:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: I didn’t know that was legal
3/14/20, 4:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: Does she live in CA?
3/14/20, 5:10 PM - Darren: In elementary school she lived a farm/ranch in los altos hills
3/14/20, 5:10 PM - Darren: so she may still be there
3/14/20, 5:10 PM - Darren: but also she goes to SLO
3/14/20, 5:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: Quick google she lives in Austin
3/14/20, 5:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: She can own a monkey
3/14/20, 5:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ill put away this citizens arrest form I found
3/14/20, 5:46 PM - Alex Starr: Shit I already sent it
3/14/20, 5:46 PM - Matt Casali: Hahaha
3/14/20, 5:46 PM - Parker: Corrin
3/14/20, 5:46 PM - Parker: where the results at
3/14/20, 5:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: ^
3/14/20, 5:47 PM - Alex Starr: He’s so mentally devastated by what we wrote he can’t finish it
3/14/20, 5:47 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
3/14/20, 5:47 PM - Jason Greenberg: Like that dumb Sandra bullock movie
3/14/20, 5:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: Breadbox
3/14/20, 5:51 PM - Alex Starr: Those rentadvd kiosks?
3/14/20, 5:54 PM - Tim Ko: Hahaha
3/14/20, 5:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yes?
3/14/20, 5:55 PM - Collin Hurst: done
3/14/20, 5:55 PM - Collin Hurst: https://forms.gle/ShQnMw11wquzM7fx9
3/14/20, 5:56 PM - Collin Hurst: choose 6, we will deal with duplicates as if they were the same vote and then choose the better one later
3/14/20, 5:59 PM - Tim Ko: Ugh collin there was one of my bullet points that u separated into two
3/14/20, 6:04 PM - Alex Starr: The raw number of “dated Celeste” options for Matt makes me feel like I missed something
3/14/20, 6:16 PM - Collin Hurst: It was all one person, the bullets are randomized tho lol
3/14/20, 6:16 PM - Collin Hurst: Oh shit
3/14/20, 6:16 PM - Collin Hurst: Was it good? Lol
3/14/20, 6:20 PM - Tim Ko: Woulda been more complete
3/14/20, 6:20 PM - Tim Ko: It was for jason, “holds grudges for decades but forgiving if you genuinely want to make amends”
3/14/20, 6:20 PM - Tim Ko: Lol, I wonder who
3/14/20, 6:21 PM - Ricky: Her mom runs a non profit that bri gd animals to groups and kids with mental disabilities
3/14/20, 6:21 PM - Ricky: So I think that gives her access to lots of crazy animals, maybe she owns not sure
3/14/20, 6:24 PM - Parker: Hahahaha alex were you the goose one
3/14/20, 6:24 PM - Parker: i’m dying at these
3/14/20, 6:25 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah lol
3/14/20, 6:25 PM - Alex Starr: The ~fuck~ ~marry~ kill for Tim wins hands down hahahaha
3/14/20, 6:26 PM - Tim Ko: Lol that was a good one
3/14/20, 6:26 PM - Tim Ko: Wait why did u cross out marry?
3/14/20, 6:26 PM - Tim Ko: Whoever wrote it
3/14/20, 6:26 PM - Collin Hurst: Cause kill tim on all accounts
3/14/20, 6:27 PM - Alex Starr: Referring to that long ass hike I think
3/14/20, 6:27 PM - Tim Ko: Huh?
3/14/20, 6:27 PM - Tim Ko: Was that when I hid Collins shoe
3/14/20, 6:27 PM - Alex Starr: Yes, but we played kill marry fuck a lot
3/14/20, 6:28 PM - Alex Starr: Collin you should open source the replies
3/14/20, 6:29 PM - Collin Hurst: eh as long as people submit soon we should be fine
3/14/20, 6:30 PM - Alex Starr: Right but I just want to see how everyone voted etc.
3/14/20, 6:31 PM - Parker: also you would be wrong sir
3/14/20, 6:31 PM - Alex Starr: What’s the texting equivalent of raising my eyebrows expecting more information?
3/14/20, 6:32 PM - Parker: 🤨
3/14/20, 6:33 PM - Alex Starr: I feel like that says I don’t believe you
3/14/20, 6:33 PM - Parker: 🧐
3/14/20, 6:34 PM - Alex Starr: Okay but spill whatever beans or tea
3/14/20, 6:37 PM - Parker: Britnee
3/14/20, 6:45 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah I will when everyone has submitted
3/14/20, 6:46 PM - Alex Starr: Submit people.  I’m trying to find ways to procrastinate here
3/14/20, 6:48 PM - Darren: I'll do it after dinner
3/14/20, 6:50 PM - Tim Ko: I just looked back at the last one u did collin
3/14/20, 6:50 PM - Tim Ko: Those were very good
3/14/20, 6:54 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah lol
3/14/20, 6:54 PM - Collin Hurst: Things have changed tho
3/14/20, 6:57 PM - Alex Starr: Where’d you find it?
3/14/20, 6:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: I love Parker’s
3/14/20, 7:00 PM - Alex Starr: Collin’s were the hardest to choose from
3/14/20, 7:00 PM - Tim Ko: <Media omitted>
3/14/20, 7:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: Collin: “lives in the shadow of his younger sibling” had me ROLLING 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
3/14/20, 7:01 PM - Tim Ko: Yoooo I wrote that hahaha
3/14/20, 7:01 PM - Tim Ko: How’d u do the bitmoji s collin?
3/14/20, 7:02 PM - Collin Hurst: I just downloaded an avatar app
3/14/20, 7:02 PM - Parker: Can we submit bitmojis
3/14/20, 7:02 PM - Alex Starr: The highest tolerance for the friend zone got me
3/14/20, 7:03 PM - Alex Starr: Also Matt has now been downgraded to vegetarian when convenient
3/14/20, 7:03 PM - Alex Starr: According to the new poll
3/14/20, 7:05 PM - Tim Ko: 😂 yeahhhh
3/14/20, 7:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lolll this was great I’m excited for results
3/14/20, 7:19 PM - Jason Greenberg: Also the Bitmojis are still accurate except Parker’s need to look more like g-easy
3/14/20, 7:25 PM - Alex Starr: I saw that option and immediately voted for it.  I’ve never seen an image of g-easy, but it’s so on the nose somehow
3/14/20, 7:26 PM - Parker: True
3/14/20, 7:26 PM - Parker: Can i just submit my bitmojis lol
3/14/20, 7:26 PM - Parker: bitmoji*
3/14/20, 7:26 PM - Alex Starr: Only if you submit for everyone
3/14/20, 7:27 PM - Alex Starr: It’s the no eating in class unless you have enough for everyone rule
3/14/20, 7:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Parker just send it to him
3/14/20, 7:49 PM - Parker: Haha i will
3/14/20, 7:49 PM - Parker: idk if i can make more than one otherwise i’d be down
3/14/20, 8:47 PM - Darren: submitted
3/15/20, 10:25 AM - Alex Starr: What do you guys think of the take home exams and potential for cheating?
3/15/20, 10:26 AM - Vaughn: I will cheat
3/15/20, 10:26 AM - Vaughn: And I will feel less bad because I know many people will be cheating/taking them in groups :(
3/15/20, 10:26 AM - Alex Starr: Well at least your honestly dishonest haha
3/15/20, 10:26 AM - Vaughn: Hbu?
3/15/20, 10:27 AM - Alex Starr: I won’t
3/15/20, 10:27 AM - Alex Starr: My grades are irrelevant this semester plus I see it as a challenge.  Do better than everyone else despite them cheating
3/15/20, 10:27 AM - Vaughn: Thats a pretty cool mentality
3/15/20, 10:28 AM - Vaughn: I though you moral compass was just super calibrated
3/15/20, 10:28 AM - Vaughn: *thought your
3/15/20, 10:28 AM - Alex Starr: Nope 0 moral compass haha
3/15/20, 10:28 AM - Vaughn: Lol
3/15/20, 10:30 AM - Alex Starr: I generally don’t care if people cheat tho would prefer it if it didn’t happen on exams.  Homework tho it should be encouraged or people should be able to use any resources at all as long as they cite it.  Programming projects I’m not sure.
3/15/20, 10:32 AM - Vaughn: Ideally i'd want test to have a higher weight in most classes, and have homework/programming assignments be free/collaborative
3/15/20, 10:33 AM - Vaughn: Encourage students to work together, learn more effectively if done right
3/15/20, 10:33 AM - Jason Greenberg: I entitled myself to an open-note final for my positive psych class
3/15/20, 10:33 AM - Alex Starr: I agree hw should be zero but project based courses would have to be different
3/15/20, 10:33 AM - Alex Starr: So that’s a yes haha
3/15/20, 10:34 AM - Jason Greenberg: I justified it as being low-priority
3/15/20, 10:35 AM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah I would if given a clear opportunity
3/15/20, 10:35 AM - Jason Greenberg: I wouldn't go so far as to just get a list of answers
3/15/20, 10:36 AM - Alex Starr: It’s an interesting problem.  Berkeley is going to proctor over zoom.  How common is cheating on in class exams?
3/15/20, 10:36 AM - Jason Greenberg: I would imagine less so
3/15/20, 10:36 AM - Jason Greenberg: Once the cameras come on I wouldn't feel comfortable doing anything sneaky
3/15/20, 10:37 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah I just meant generally
3/15/20, 10:37 AM - Alex Starr: I think it’s fairly common
3/15/20, 10:37 AM - Jason Greenberg: In class I have no idea
3/15/20, 10:37 AM - Jason Greenberg: I was in a chem final once when someone got caught
3/15/20, 10:38 AM - Alex Starr: I feel like it’s so hard to prove unless it’s a CS project or blatant
3/15/20, 10:38 AM - Jason Greenberg: The prof walked up to them, yelled what the hell are you doing really loud and ripped their test out of their hand
3/15/20, 10:40 AM - Jason Greenberg: Do you consider performance enhancing drugs cheating?
3/15/20, 10:40 AM - Jason Greenberg: Like adderall
3/15/20, 10:40 AM - Alex Starr: Probably
3/15/20, 10:41 AM - Alex Starr: If on the exam.  Before hand or for hw should be free game assuming no side effects
3/15/20, 10:43 AM - Alex Starr: In general I think exams cheating should be prevented as much as possible and on important projects.  Any other assignment either shouldn’t count or be impossible to cheat on by virtue of nothing being considered cheating for those assignments.
3/15/20, 10:46 AM - Darren: Some professors make their online exams harder because they expect a lot of people to cheat
3/15/20, 10:50 AM - Matt Casali: I think that's the most common case
3/15/20, 10:50 AM - Matt Casali: My physics professor just said fuck it, it's open note, open book, open computer
3/15/20, 10:50 AM - Matt Casali: So the final's just gonna be really hard
3/15/20, 10:52 AM - Alex Starr: That is impossible for lower division though.  Intro calculus can be solved with wolram alpha pretty much
3/15/20, 10:52 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah definitely
3/15/20, 10:53 AM - Matt Casali: But I'd assume theres some program out there that allows students to sign in for a test that will block access to sites like that
3/15/20, 10:53 AM - Matt Casali: Wasnt that a thing for the PSAT?
3/15/20, 10:53 AM - Jason Greenberg: There's always a way around when it's online
3/15/20, 10:55 AM - Parker: Yeah unless you’re taking it on a campus computer i don’t think they can do that
3/15/20, 10:55 AM - Parker: But it’s like that when i’ve taken online tests in class on school computers
3/15/20, 10:55 AM - Parker: it’s been like that*
3/15/20, 10:56 AM - Jason Greenberg: It'll be interesting tho I bet Darren's right they might make exams harder
3/15/20, 10:56 AM - Parker: Yeah
3/15/20, 10:56 AM - Parker: For my marketing one this week he completely changed the format when it changed to online
3/15/20, 10:58 AM - Jason Greenberg: When we get take home finals for neuro-y classes they are usually really brutal
3/15/20, 10:58 AM - Jason Greenberg: It helped cement the concepts just by doing the test which was a positive id say
3/15/20, 11:08 AM - Darren: Jason's right, you need a custom environment to block other websites which isn't feasible unless you're on campus (even then you can usually task manager -> chrome out of them)
3/15/20, 12:37 PM - Tim Ko: One of my classes is making it open note

3/15/20, 8:38 PM - Tim Ko: Say dreyers vanilla ice cream
3/15/20, 8:38 PM - Alex Starr: That’s dessert
3/15/20, 8:39 PM - Alex Starr: But dreyers vanilla is a desert of flavor
3/15/20, 8:41 PM - Tim Ko: Ohhh I totally read it as dessert haha
3/15/20, 8:41 PM - Alex Starr: Did you think the atacama was a fancy cake?
3/15/20, 8:49 PM - Tim Ko: Or some sort of dessert haha
3/15/20, 10:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’m a big region guy
3/16/20, 9:08 AM - Alex Starr: When we go to UCSC we should be careful about the social distancing thing
3/16/20, 9:14 AM - Collin Hurst: From each other?
3/16/20, 9:15 AM - Alex Starr: Yes
3/16/20, 9:15 AM - Alex Starr: Everyone should have their own cup for die up etc.
3/16/20, 9:17 AM - Collin Hurst: What about high fiving my partner when I sink you
3/16/20, 9:19 AM - Alex Starr: Generally regarded as a bad move
3/16/20, 9:20 AM - Collin Hurst: Ok I’ll just dab on you then
3/16/20, 9:20 AM - Alex Starr: Also a bad move but for unrelated reasons
3/16/20, 9:21 AM - Jason Greenberg: Collin you should post the results every time you sink one
3/16/20, 9:21 AM - Alex Starr: Die up is also probably a bad idea
3/16/20, 9:21 AM - Collin Hurst: That’s like the best game you can play
3/16/20, 9:22 AM - Collin Hurst: Better than smash probably
3/16/20, 9:22 AM - Alex Starr: Low bar
3/16/20, 9:23 AM - Alex Starr: We will all be touching the same die.  It’s not a great plan
3/16/20, 9:23 AM - Alex Starr: Maybe if we drop it in isopropanol in between tosses
3/16/20, 9:23 AM - Collin Hurst: But there’s a lot of stuff we’d be touching
3/16/20, 9:24 AM - Collin Hurst: What if we all just wash our hands well every 30 mins
3/16/20, 9:25 AM - Jason Greenberg: Every time you would normally drink, wash your hands
3/16/20, 9:26 AM - Alex Starr: Just the die right?
3/16/20, 9:29 AM - Collin Hurst: I mean if we just hung out
3/16/20, 9:29 AM - Collin Hurst: Doorknobs , plates etc
3/16/20, 9:30 AM - Alex Starr: Not nearly as frequently as the die
3/16/20, 9:30 AM - Alex Starr: And those are much harder to dunk in isopropanol
3/16/20, 10:04 AM - Vaughn: Truuuee the viral droplets stay on the ground and those dice'll scoop em up
3/16/20, 10:04 AM - Alex Starr: I more meant your hands haha
3/16/20, 10:04 AM - Jason Greenberg: Lol
3/16/20, 10:04 AM - Vaughn: Also truuuee
3/16/20, 10:05 AM - Vaughn: Lets make washing hands a drinking game
3/16/20, 10:06 AM - Vaughn: Wash hands for exactly 20 seconds, if you go under take a shot, if you go over pick someone to take a shot
3/16/20, 10:06 AM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
3/16/20, 10:07 AM - Alex Starr: If your exact everyone else takes a shot
3/16/20, 10:07 AM - Vaughn: +- .5s
3/16/20, 10:07 AM - Vaughn: Lowkey that sounds hella fun
3/16/20, 10:08 AM - Alex Starr: Sounds like a lot of people washing their hands for 25 seconds and Collin passing out or dying
3/16/20, 10:58 AM - Collin Hurst: I’ve heard from multiple sources that there’s gonna be a shutdown
3/16/20, 10:58 AM - Collin Hurst: Like no travel between cities
3/16/20, 10:59 AM - Vaughn: Paste a couple sources?
3/16/20, 10:59 AM - Vaughn: That would be fuckin wild
3/16/20, 11:02 AM - Collin Hurst: I’m looking online but haven’t actually seen anything
3/16/20, 11:02 AM - Jason Greenberg: What sources
3/16/20, 11:02 AM - Alex Starr: I’ve heard multiple saying it’s fake though
3/16/20, 11:03 AM - Collin Hurst: 4 different people mentioned the possibility of it
3/16/20, 11:03 AM - Collin Hurst: Liams dad, Toris dad who heard about it in the military, rohan’s dad, liams friend
3/16/20, 11:03 AM - Alex Starr: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.whio.com/news/national/coronavirus-national-quarantine-nsc-says-texts-are-hoax/Wa2TCveWPiWsXpTYLFBaoO/amp.html
3/16/20, 11:03 AM - Collin Hurst: Idk what dad network people are on but that’s what I’ve heard

3/16/20, 11:16 AM - Alex Starr: I do not.  He had a hand in producing Liam.
3/16/20, 11:16 AM - Jason Greenberg: Hayleys school contacted her today while she is in Puerto Rico and told them they couldn’t stay at school because they believe there is going to be a domestic travel ban in 24-48 hours
3/16/20, 11:17 AM - Jason Greenberg: Hayleys words were they were in contact with the government or something
3/16/20, 11:17 AM - Jason Greenberg: It seems less likely the school would be duped but not impossible
3/16/20, 11:18 AM - Alex Starr: Huge difference between domestic travel ban and total shutdown
3/16/20, 11:18 AM - Collin Hurst: Ey liams cool
3/16/20, 11:23 AM - Jason Greenberg: Did someone say total shutdown?
3/16/20, 11:23 AM - Alex Starr: Collin did

3/16/20, 11:35 AM - Alex Starr: And would make an excellent clown
3/16/20, 11:35 AM - Alex Starr: So it’s an open and shit case
3/16/20, 11:35 AM - Collin Hurst: Didn’t say total shutdown
3/16/20, 11:36 AM - Alex Starr: “Like no travel between cities”
3/16/20, 11:37 AM - Collin Hurst: I said thats what I’ve heard

3/16/20, 12:04 PM - Darren: This message was deleted
3/16/20, 12:04 PM - Parker: Unless he moved to SC and became collins housemate, different liam
3/16/20, 12:05 PM - Alex Starr: ? I’m honestly asking
3/16/20, 12:05 PM - Alex Starr: Oh

3/16/20, 12:08 PM - Darren: Oh shit, I missed

3/17/20, 12:17 AM - Ricky: Hi okay i was forwarded this text and it could be another hoax but thought i’d sent it out in case - 

So my friend who goes to school with a police officer who is friend’s with De Blasio’s son said that his friend in the Army Corps in DC sent him this email:
Hello all: my brother who is a surgeon in Italy just had lunch with a WHO lawyer who told him that his youngest son is a top colonel in the Marines just met with a physician from Harvard Medical School who just texted him and said that the governor of New York is about to announce that the president has ordered your mom to suck on deez nuts.
3/17/20, 12:17 AM - Parker: got eeeeeem
3/17/20, 12:18 AM - Darren: Aaaaand Bob's your uncle
3/17/20, 1:38 AM - Tim Ko: This random multimillionaire just requested to follow me on insta lol
3/17/20, 8:49 AM - Alex Starr: There’s apparently some discussion of whether it makes sense to cancel classes and delay them
3/17/20, 8:55 AM - Alex Starr: I would be incredibly upset if that happened
3/17/20, 9:01 AM - Jason Greenberg: What’s the rationale
3/17/20, 9:02 AM - Tim Ko: Same
3/17/20, 9:02 AM - Tim Ko: Why don’t they just let us graduate
3/17/20, 9:02 AM - Alex Starr: Some students have been disrupted to the point they can’t finish classes.  E.g. no internet, reliant on jobs, etc.
3/17/20, 9:04 AM - Alex Starr: Tim we should both contact the chancellor or something
3/17/20, 9:05 AM - Jason Greenberg: You would think it would make sense to offer those students accomodations unless they were a majority
3/17/20, 9:06 AM - Alex Starr: Yes
3/17/20, 9:06 AM - Alex Starr: But the possibility is actually filling me with dread
3/17/20, 9:07 AM - Jason Greenberg: yeah that wouldn't be great
3/17/20, 9:09 AM - Tim Ko: Sure
3/17/20, 9:09 AM - Tim Ko: Email?
3/17/20, 9:10 AM - Parker: that would be ass
3/17/20, 9:10 AM - Alex Starr: I think
3/17/20, 9:10 AM - Parker: on the bright side pman is on the road! gang gang
3/17/20, 9:13 AM - Jason Greenberg: Gang gang
3/17/20, 9:29 AM - Tim Ko: Ayyy
3/18/20, 8:52 AM - Alex Starr: @16502079920 should I buy stock in a couple weeks?
3/18/20, 8:57 AM - Jason Greenberg: Soon
3/18/20, 8:57 AM - Jason Greenberg: I haven’t figured out if it’s a couple weeks or a few months
3/18/20, 8:58 AM - Jason Greenberg: You could always start a gradual buy if you’re feeling particularly risk averse
3/18/20, 8:58 AM - Jason Greenberg: Personally I don’t think we’ve bottomed given that we’ve it 3-5 year lows but Europe is hitting like 10-year lows
3/18/20, 8:58 AM - Jason Greenberg: And the virus hasn’t hit us as hard yet
3/18/20, 9:00 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah waiting a couple weeks for sure.  Which stocks?
3/18/20, 9:00 AM - Alex Starr: Or just one of those general economic growth things?
3/18/20, 9:22 AM - Jason Greenberg: Generally an index fund is your best bet
3/18/20, 9:23 AM - Jason Greenberg: You want one with lowest possible expense ratio, which is a portion you’d have to pay into a fund for the cost management of the fund
3/18/20, 9:24 AM - Jason Greenberg: Vanguard has the cheapest one I’ve found bc it’s run by computers
3/18/20, 9:24 AM - Alex Starr: I’m also already  set up with vanguard so that’s ideal
3/18/20, 9:24 AM - Alex Starr: Lmk what you end up doing for sure.
3/18/20, 9:25 AM - Jason Greenberg: You can invest in the Vanguard 500 as a mutual fund (symbol: VFIAX) or as an ETF (symbol: VOO)
3/18/20, 9:25 AM - Jason Greenberg: ETF is less likely to actively sell assets (which would incur capital gains tax)
3/18/20, 9:25 AM - Jason Greenberg: So you’d want an ETF imo
3/18/20, 9:26 AM - Jason Greenberg: As far as other specific stock moves I don’t have any atm but I’ll let you know if that changes
3/18/20, 9:26 AM - Jason Greenberg: Nice
3/18/20, 9:30 AM - Alex Starr: My dad suggested an ETF as well haha
3/18/20, 9:30 AM - Alex Starr: I know damn near nothing about this stuff and despite my wishes it’s super important so any info is helpful
3/18/20, 9:30 AM - Jason Greenberg: I’d expect no less from Barry
3/18/20, 9:31 AM - Jason Greenberg: Happy to discuss
3/18/20, 9:31 AM - Jason Greenberg: Still salty no one came to meetings in high school
3/18/20, 9:32 AM - Alex Starr: I had a conflict with not going sry
3/18/20, 9:34 AM - Jason Greenberg: It’s ok I’m mostly salty bc it’s fun to be salty
3/18/20, 9:39 AM - Alex Starr: Here’s a question: is the economic cost of these measures worth the disease prevention?
3/18/20, 9:45 AM - Jason Greenberg: Depends on how you weigh the costs
3/18/20, 9:45 AM - Jason Greenberg: Lives v dollars kind of thing
3/18/20, 9:46 AM - Alex Starr: But dollars are lives
3/18/20, 9:47 AM - Jason Greenberg: Like hypothetically if you told everyone to continue as normal?
3/18/20, 9:47 AM - Alex Starr: Spend a trillion on economic stimulus that could be spent prepping for climate change or other things
3/18/20, 9:47 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah
3/18/20, 9:48 AM - Jason Greenberg: I think the economic stimulus would have come in some amount near that with or without the virus bc of the economic cycle
3/18/20, 9:48 AM - Matt Casali: I feel it haha
3/18/20, 9:48 AM - Alex Starr: Some yeah but I don’t things would be nearly as severe
3/18/20, 9:48 AM - Jason Greenberg: I think the quarantine obviously makes the economic downturn worse
3/18/20, 9:49 AM - Alex Starr: There are other nebulous factors as well.
3/18/20, 9:49 AM - Jason Greenberg: Let’s say somehow productivity stay near the same level assuming the 20% of the population that is severely affected is at or beyond retirement age
3/18/20, 9:49 AM - Jason Greenberg: Well actually you can’t assume that bc we have so many obese people
3/18/20, 9:49 AM - Jason Greenberg: At all ages
3/18/20, 9:50 AM - Alex Starr: No but you can I think assume significantly higher productivity
3/18/20, 9:50 AM - Jason Greenberg: Ok sure
3/18/20, 9:50 AM - Alex Starr: I think another factor is how it affects the election
3/18/20, 9:51 AM - Jason Greenberg: Hm that's a tough one
3/18/20, 9:51 AM - Alex Starr: Well old people vote and vote for trump...
3/18/20, 9:51 AM - Jason Greenberg: I'm pretty sure we were hitting recession soon either way
3/18/20, 9:51 AM - Alex Starr: But maybe not soon enough to see trump ousted
3/18/20, 9:51 AM - Jason Greenberg: Bc of slowed growth leading to decreased spending in china before the virus
3/18/20, 9:51 AM - Jason Greenberg: Maybe
3/18/20, 9:52 AM - Jason Greenberg: Ok let's assume no recession
3/18/20, 9:52 AM - Alex Starr: Okay
3/18/20, 9:52 AM - Alex Starr: Then I think it is hugely dependent on whether trumps odds of winning increas
3/18/20, 9:53 AM - Jason Greenberg: Virus spread is real bad and old people can't go out to vote
3/18/20, 9:53 AM - Alex Starr: Because CDC worst case puts the death toll at 1.7 million domestically
3/18/20, 9:53 AM - Alex Starr: Sign me up for this scenario
3/18/20, 9:53 AM - Alex Starr: Because large scale sudden recession has a body count as well
3/18/20, 9:54 AM - Jason Greenberg: That's true, what do you reckon that number is
3/18/20, 9:54 AM - Alex Starr: I don’t know
3/18/20, 9:54 AM - Alex Starr: Not even sure I have enough info to speculate
3/18/20, 9:55 AM - Alex Starr: Another factor is the efficacy of the shelter in place
3/18/20, 9:55 AM - Alex Starr: Cuz if it only halved the death toll it probably wouldn’t be worth it
3/18/20, 9:57 AM - Jason Greenberg: GDP per capita is 60k
3/18/20, 9:57 AM - Alex Starr: Per death?
3/18/20, 9:58 AM - Alex Starr: Like 60k drop kills someone?
3/18/20, 9:58 AM - Jason Greenberg: Well each person is worth that?
3/18/20, 9:58 AM - Jason Greenberg: Or generates
3/18/20, 9:58 AM - Jason Greenberg: idk
3/18/20, 9:59 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah idk either.  Just interesting to think about.
3/18/20, 9:59 AM - Jason Greenberg: I'm looking into gdp per capita by age
3/18/20, 10:00 AM - Alex Starr: Is there a measure for y drop in gdp means x deaths?
3/18/20, 10:00 AM - Alex Starr: There should be
3/18/20, 10:05 AM - Jason Greenberg: <Media omitted>
3/18/20, 10:08 AM - Alex Starr: Nice
3/18/20, 10:08 AM - Alex Starr: I’ll read more after lecture
3/18/20, 10:08 AM - Parker: you could run a regression model in R for that
3/18/20, 10:08 AM - Parker: measure the impact of number of deaths on gdp
3/18/20, 10:10 AM - Alex Starr: No we want the reverse
3/18/20, 10:10 AM - Alex Starr: Impact of gdp on number of deaths
3/18/20, 10:10 AM - Parker: Oh
3/18/20, 10:11 AM - Jason Greenberg: The also have just plain gdp against death rate but I figured growth was what we wanted
3/18/20, 10:11 AM - Parker: Would the economy bc the respond variable though
3/18/20, 10:11 AM - Alex Starr: Nah death rate
3/18/20, 10:11 AM - Parker: Bc the economy doesn’t directly cause deaths whereas deaths can directly impact the economy
3/18/20, 10:11 AM - Jason Greenberg: In this case the hypothesis is that it does
3/18/20, 10:12 AM - Parker: gotchaa
3/18/20, 10:13 AM - Ricky: Hey friends, I may not come home
3/18/20, 10:14 AM - Alex Starr: That sucks but we couldn’t hang out anyway tbh
3/18/20, 10:14 AM - Ricky: My mom is worried about safety and since she a doctor and has to keep going to high populated locations she’s like, if you come home you can’t go anywhere
3/18/20, 10:14 AM - Alex Starr: So don’t let that impact your decision
3/18/20, 10:14 AM - Alex Starr: Oh that makes sense
3/18/20, 10:15 AM - Ricky: Dang, yeah, mostly want to see you guys and fam and grace
3/18/20, 10:15 AM - Parker: :((((
3/18/20, 10:15 AM - Ricky: But, if I can’t
3/18/20, 10:15 AM - Ricky: Then, idk
3/18/20, 10:15 AM - Jason Greenberg: Broooooo
3/18/20, 10:16 AM - Jason Greenberg: It is a sad time
3/18/20, 10:16 AM - Ricky: Since I’m still in the thick of my schooling my mom was like you should probably just stay home for many weeks but I got shit to do and don’t wanna have to deal with it in my home home where I don’t have a desk/bedroom of my own
3/18/20, 10:17 AM - Jason Greenberg: I am also v sorry for you and grace
3/18/20, 10:17 AM - Jason Greenberg: F’s in the chat
3/18/20, 10:19 AM - Ricky: Thanks bud, we’ll see
3/18/20, 10:19 AM - Matt Casali: Sorry ricky :( plenty of zoom hangouts with us though! If that helps haha
3/18/20, 10:22 AM - Matt Casali: Hows your mom doing? I'm sure she's stressed
3/18/20, 10:36 AM - Darren: She's eating oysters
3/18/20, 11:07 AM - Tim Ko: :((
3/18/20, 11:07 AM - Tim Ko: It’s safer in so cal right?
3/18/20, 11:29 AM - Collin Hurst: Come stay and live in sc!!
3/18/20, 12:04 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah ricky I 100% wouldn't mind seeing if my parents wouldn't mind hosting you if you wanted to come back to the bay
3/18/20, 12:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: Also not to meddle too much but graces parents might be an option
3/18/20, 12:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: Obviously I don’t know the situation
3/18/20, 12:23 PM - Parker: this seems like a good option
3/18/20, 12:23 PM - Parker: i’d offer my house too but all my step siblings are gonna be home
3/18/20, 6:57 PM - Matt Casali: Can someone explain to me how likely the shelter in place is to continue passed the stated date and what would be the point of stopping shelter in place without a vaccine
3/18/20, 6:58 PM - Matt Casali: I cant figure it out
3/18/20, 6:59 PM - Alex Starr: The idea is that given shelter in place for say a month, if no one has symptoms anymore then travel restrictions are sufficient
3/18/20, 6:59 PM - Alex Starr: But I’d say we can expect it to last until May
3/18/20, 7:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: In theory if every person stayed in their home for 3-4 weeks and all cases played out, the virus would effectively evaporate
3/18/20, 7:00 PM - Alex Starr: Yes
3/18/20, 7:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: But that won’t really happen
3/18/20, 7:02 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah that's what I'm thinking, so is a shelter in place likely until a vaccine? Or is it just necessary in order to slow it down before it gets out of hand
3/18/20, 7:02 PM - Matt Casali: I guess I was viewing it as a solution when maybe it's not
3/18/20, 7:02 PM - Ricky: Unless ur china
3/18/20, 7:03 PM - Ricky: Who can force their citizens to do anything
3/18/20, 7:03 PM - Ricky: Like actually stay indoors
3/18/20, 7:03 PM - Collin Hurst: Well they were arresting people for holding large gatherings
3/18/20, 7:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/16/social-distancing-coronavirus/
Found this
3/18/20, 7:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: TLDR; it depends on when peak infection is reached and even after that some measures like distancing, hand washing, and quarantining infected could still be necessary
3/18/20, 7:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: We’re looking at months not weeks
3/18/20, 7:17 PM - Parker: ^
3/18/20, 7:17 PM - Tim Ko: China #1
3/18/20, 7:17 PM - Parker: All about flattening the curve
3/18/20, 7:23 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah months probably
3/18/20, 7:26 PM - Parker: an expert on msnbc earlier said 8 weeks is a reasonable estimate but it really depends on the precautions we take
3/18/20, 7:27 PM - Parker: our curve is not on a good trajectory rn
3/18/20, 7:30 PM - Alex Starr: Given how limited our ability to flatten the curve is, I question trying at all
3/18/20, 7:31 PM - Collin Hurst: I then die up goddamn
3/18/20, 7:31 PM - Alex Starr: From a government perspective.  Obviously if we are quarantining, we should full send the quarantine
3/18/20, 7:31 PM - Alex Starr: Had to let me finish Collin
3/18/20, 7:31 PM - Collin Hurst: Lol
3/18/20, 7:32 PM - Parker: Our ability was pretty damn good a week ago but our leadership shat themselves on that one
3/18/20, 7:33 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah we’ll see
3/18/20, 7:33 PM - Alex Starr: I hope trump loses
3/18/20, 7:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’m ready for my 1k check to buy some chicken tendies
3/18/20, 7:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: What are y’all gonna do with it?
3/18/20, 7:57 PM - Vaughn: Pay for this months rent
3/18/20, 7:58 PM - Vaughn: With a little left over for some BK chicken nuggets!
3/18/20, 7:58 PM - Collin Hurst: That’s 8000 nuggets goddamn
3/18/20, 7:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: Nugzzzzz!
3/18/20, 7:58 PM - Alex Starr: Nothing
3/18/20, 7:59 PM - Alex Starr: Unless some bakeries open
3/18/20, 8:13 PM - Matt Casali: You could buy one big golden nugget wow
3/18/20, 8:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: Bad for the economeee
3/18/20, 8:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: Buy that new firmware upgrade
3/18/20, 8:51 PM - Alex Starr: Bad for trumps chances
3/18/20, 9:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: Damn this man wants people to die
3/18/20, 9:11 PM - Alex Starr: I’d argue trump in office kills more people than corona virus
3/18/20, 9:12 PM - Collin Hurst: Hot take
3/18/20, 9:15 PM - Tim Ko: Yoooo time to get some new Minecraft skins
3/18/20, 9:19 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ahaha
3/18/20, 9:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: Tendies not economic frenzies
3/18/20, 9:26 PM - Alex Starr: The truly brave get cheap takeout sushi
3/18/20, 9:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: Sushi 85 saves lives
3/18/20, 9:30 PM - Darren: Categorically false
3/18/20, 9:30 PM - Alex Starr: If any place has a death toll it’s there
3/19/20, 10:56 AM - Collin Hurst: We can play poker online too with google hangout
3/19/20, 11:05 AM - Alex Starr: Seriously use zoom
3/19/20, 11:05 AM - Alex Starr: I will show you the way
3/19/20, 11:06 AM - Jason Greenberg: Down for online poker
3/19/20, 11:06 AM - Jason Greenberg: You have a platform for it?
3/19/20, 11:06 AM - Collin Hurst: Poker now works fine then we can just Venmo later
3/19/20, 11:29 AM - Tim Ko: Yeee down for poker
3/19/20, 11:29 AM - Tim Ko: Down to take Collins money
3/19/20, 11:29 AM - Collin Hurst: We will see how that goes
3/19/20, 11:29 AM - Jason Greenberg: ^this
3/19/20, 11:29 AM - Collin Hurst: Good luck hope you’ve been studying
3/19/20, 11:30 AM - Matt Casali: Collin has been studying this whole time guys, dont mess with him
3/19/20, 11:30 AM - Matt Casali: Hes been watching hours of youtube videos
3/19/20, 11:30 AM - Parker: You study for poker and still lose?
3/19/20, 11:30 AM - Collin Hurst: I haven’t been losing lol
3/19/20, 11:30 AM - Jason Greenberg: He subscribed to that masterclass guy i bet
3/19/20, 11:31 AM - Jason Greenberg: Been watching Dan Bilzerian documentaries
3/19/20, 11:31 AM - Collin Hurst: Ew
3/19/20, 11:32 AM - Matt Casali: Hes been watching poker videos instead of finalizing the herd meme results
3/19/20, 11:32 AM - Collin Hurst: True
3/19/20, 11:32 AM - Matt Casali: :(
3/19/20, 11:33 AM - Darren: I mean, this is kinda on brand for collin
3/19/20, 11:34 AM - Collin Hurst: Ew Dan bilzerian
3/19/20, 11:34 AM - Jason Greenberg: We all hate ourselves a little bit
3/19/20, 11:35 AM - Jason Greenberg: Don't be too hard on yourself
3/19/20, 11:41 AM - Tim Ko: Lmaoooo
3/19/20, 11:42 AM - Tim Ko: All I know is last time I played with collin, he ran out of money after like three rounds
3/19/20, 11:43 AM - Darren: I love dunking on small children as much as the next guy, but Collin has actually been cleaning up in Santa Cruz
3/19/20, 11:43 AM - Matt Casali: But tim wasnt there..
3/19/20, 11:43 AM - Matt Casali: Coincidence?
3/19/20, 11:44 AM - Jason Greenberg: If Tim’s not there it didn’t happen
3/19/20, 11:44 AM - Darren: Collin chokes when Tim is around for sure
3/19/20, 11:44 AM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
3/19/20, 11:45 AM - Tim Ko: Haha
3/19/20, 11:45 AM - Tim Ko: ^
3/19/20, 11:45 AM - Tim Ko: Collin is scared of me
3/19/20, 11:46 AM - Tim Ko: Physically, emotionally and mentally
3/19/20, 11:47 AM - Collin Hurst: Sure
3/19/20, 11:55 AM - Parker: i think not
3/19/20, 2:42 PM - Matt Casali: Alex are you going to be home?
3/19/20, 2:44 PM - Alex Starr: For a while
3/19/20, 2:44 PM - Alex Starr: Why?
3/19/20, 2:44 PM - Matt Casali: Do you have my switch?
3/19/20, 2:44 PM - Alex Starr: No
3/19/20, 2:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lel
3/19/20, 2:44 PM - Matt Casali: Fuck dude
3/19/20, 2:44 PM - Matt Casali: Okay well I have yours
3/19/20, 2:45 PM - Alex Starr: Then maybe I do
3/19/20, 2:45 PM - Alex Starr: Idk
3/19/20, 2:45 PM - Matt Casali: Collin said he had mine but it was yours
3/19/20, 2:45 PM - Alex Starr: Sounds about right
3/19/20, 2:45 PM - Matt Casali: Can you check when you get the chance?
3/19/20, 2:45 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah
3/19/20, 2:45 PM - Alex Starr: Use mine for now
3/19/20, 2:46 PM - Matt Casali: Okeydoke
3/19/20, 2:52 PM - Matt Casali: Collin do you remember if I gave you our switch too or just Alex's
3/19/20, 2:55 PM - Alex Starr: Matt I’ll be able to check when my brother finishes his final
3/19/20, 2:57 PM - Matt Casali: Okeydoke thank you
3/19/20, 3:02 PM - Matt Casali: Tell him to hurry up cause I wanna play animal crossing
3/19/20, 3:03 PM - Collin Hurst: No idea
3/19/20, 3:03 PM - Collin Hurst: Ours *
3/19/20, 3:04 PM - Matt Casali: Hey I said it earlier give me a break
3/19/20, 3:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: Do we need a beer virus chat?
3/19/20, 3:56 PM - Parker: Seems to more or less be every chat rn haha
3/19/20, 4:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: If it wasn't already disgustingly obvious, lay off's are comin baby: https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2008-02-19%202020-03-19&geo=US&q=laid%20off,got%20a%20job,coronavius
3/19/20, 4:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: 4x increase in search term "laid off"
3/19/20, 4:17 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah it’s a shitty situation for people trying to find jobs or apply to post secondary stuffs. Recessions lead to large increases in grad/med/law school applications and make job finding super hard (the latter being way more obvious)
3/19/20, 4:19 PM - Jason Greenberg: oof glhf me and tim next year
3/19/20, 4:26 PM - Matt Casali: And me!
3/19/20, 4:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh did I miss that?
3/19/20, 4:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: You decided to apply to stuff?
3/19/20, 4:29 PM - Matt Casali: I will this fall
3/19/20, 4:30 PM - Matt Casali: I may have not mentioned it haha
3/19/20, 4:30 PM - Alex Starr: What’re you applying to and you didn’t
3/19/20, 4:31 PM - Matt Casali: Not sure yet, I'm kinda procrastinating on seeing where I wanna apply to
3/19/20, 4:31 PM - Darren: Physics is his passion?
3/19/20, 4:32 PM - Matt Casali: Acoustics Engineering if I can find a cool program
3/19/20, 4:32 PM - Matt Casali: Applied physics if not
3/19/20, 4:32 PM - Collin Hurst: Nice
3/19/20, 4:32 PM - Alex Starr: Masters?
3/19/20, 4:35 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah probably unless I really really like it
3/19/20, 4:37 PM - Alex Starr: Makes sense
3/19/20, 4:37 PM - Alex Starr: What’s the application process like?
3/19/20, 4:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oo sounds cool
3/19/20, 4:39 PM - Matt Casali: No idea at all, I've only looked for a little bit
3/19/20, 4:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: Does that let you use physics?
3/19/20, 4:39 PM - Matt Casali: But theres a cool program in france!
3/19/20, 4:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: Buh bye!
3/19/20, 4:40 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah it will, but not a lot of big boy physics
3/19/20, 4:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: I see I see
3/19/20, 4:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: Maybe they need someone to bring them the big boy physics
3/19/20, 4:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: There’s your essay right there
3/19/20, 5:09 PM - Matt Casali: Haha I like thay
3/19/20, 6:12 PM - Parker: <Media omitted>

3/20/20, 1:15 PM - Collin Hurst: Just read the damned article
3/20/20, 1:17 PM - Alex Starr: Unless there are some blurry tattoos idk what you mean by read
3/20/20, 1:54 PM - Tim Ko: Lol I’m never clicking a link that collin provides again
3/20/20, 1:54 PM - Collin Hurst: There’s a damn preview video
3/20/20, 1:54 PM - Collin Hurst: I sent the evidence

3/20/20, 4:34 PM - Alex Starr: Since we are imprisoned for two months, will everyone become absolutely jacked? What is the least safe food to get as takeout?
3/20/20, 4:37 PM - Darren: I will likely be the same as before shelter-in-place started
3/20/20, 4:40 PM - Collin Hurst: I don’t have any equipment in sc
3/20/20, 4:41 PM - Matt Casali: Same
3/20/20, 4:43 PM - Alex Starr: I think sushi is probably the most infectious takeout, and ramen as takeout seems like a terrible idea in general.
3/20/20, 4:43 PM - Tim Ko: I will be much more out of shape
3/20/20, 4:45 PM - Darren: PSA: Alex hates Asian people
3/20/20, 4:45 PM - Collin Hurst: What’s new

3/20/20, 5:14 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah that’s what I thought
3/20/20, 5:14 PM - Alex Starr: Absolutely let me know how it goes
3/20/20, 5:14 PM - Alex Starr: And if possible, eat it on a bumpy road trip

3/22/20, 2:54 PM - Parker: i’m not!
3/22/20, 2:57 PM - Parker: ya know that’s a good question. I told her initially  with everyone going on in my life and finding a job/school along with the uncertainty of life beyond june, a relationship wasn’t a priority in my life at the time and i was more down to keep things chill but now that she kinda said some other guy opened up to her and wants something more along the lines of what she wants (a relationship) it’s bummed me out a bit
3/22/20, 2:58 PM - Parker: Bc she’s cool and we went on a couple dates and have had fun together
3/22/20, 3:01 PM - Darren: Bummed to the point of second guessing your decision?

3/23/20, 12:13 AM - Darren: You're not necessarily wrong, but the context behind the situations are definitely different
3/23/20, 12:14 AM - Darren: Especially the rigor of our self isolations thus far
3/23/20, 1:06 AM - Collin Hurst: makes sense
3/23/20, 1:06 AM - Collin Hurst: im down tho
3/23/20, 6:32 AM - Alex Starr: Looking like my comment on callous disregard for public health was spot onactually
3/23/20, 6:38 AM - Alex Starr: I mean you might have given it to whatshername and now she can transmit it to her family.  Just because you are asymptomatic doesn’t mean you don’t have it/can’t transmit it
3/23/20, 8:00 AM - Parker: ^
3/23/20, 8:00 AM - Parker: for all we know we could all have it rn

3/23/20, 1:27 PM - Ricky: Hi guys

I know you are aware and vigilant but I was reminded again today. Thanks for taking measures in this tough time. 

I read a report from an epidemiologist that said that visiting girls friends is dangerous to the community.  So from now on I think that you guys should meet at a distance.  The whole 6 feet thing.  So sorry.

3/25/20, 2:26 PM - Parker: Wait rick are you home? i’m confused
3/25/20, 3:16 PM - Ricky: Yeah!

3/25/20, 5:23 PM - Alex Starr: We should have a corona Deadpool.  Guess death toll by 8:00 pm the next day.  Each put in 1.00 dollar
3/25/20, 5:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: Sick pool could be fun
3/25/20, 5:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: First to get sick
3/25/20, 5:24 PM - Darren: Collin free
3/25/20, 5:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’m going with Vaughn bc his house is basically a wet market
3/25/20, 5:25 PM - Darren: If either of them get it, it'll be impossible to know who got it first
3/25/20, 5:36 PM - Matt Casali: Alex would I be able to buy one of your gamecube controllers off you?
3/25/20, 7:25 PM - Alex Starr: If I can find them
3/25/20, 7:26 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah betting on Collin or Vaughn doubles the odds
3/25/20, 7:52 PM - Matt Casali: Well I have a lot of them rn
3/25/20, 7:52 PM - Matt Casali: Maybe even all of them
3/25/20, 8:16 PM - Alex Starr: That’d explain it lol
3/26/20, 1:30 AM - Tim Ko: Just watched frozen 2, it was not great
3/26/20, 7:00 AM - Alex Starr: Did you guys see that YouTube is only streaming videos in sd for a month?
3/26/20, 7:10 AM - Jason Greenberg: Wow
3/26/20, 7:58 AM - Collin Hurst: Dang
3/26/20, 8:00 AM - Jason Greenberg: Update on entering the stock market: despite recent and likely continued rally, I’m very wary about buying anything long because it doesn’t seem like the number of current jobless claims has been priced in (3.3 million) but most importantly that things are about to get a lot worse and there doesn’t seem to be general consensus about that
3/26/20, 8:02 AM - Jason Greenberg: Unless you’re extremely risk averse I’d hold off dollar-cost averaging (dumb boomer strategy of easing into the market which they’re all about to start doing)
3/26/20, 10:46 AM - Parker: So can peeps do poker this aft?
3/26/20, 11:02 AM - Darren: Yes, but Kristoff's ballad was fantastic

3/27/20, 1:46 AM - Parker: next thing you know you go to the corner store to get some beers and you kill an old lady
3/27/20, 6:34 AM - Alex Starr: My math class has replaced our final exam with making 4 math based tiktok videos...
3/27/20, 7:46 AM - Matt Casali: Wait
3/27/20, 7:46 AM - Matt Casali: Alex
3/27/20, 7:46 AM - Matt Casali: That has to be a joke

3/27/20, 8:13 AM - Matt Casali: I'm so sorry
3/27/20, 8:14 AM - Alex Starr: 4 topics, 1 of which has to be branches, 2 videos per topic.  One explaining the concept one working out a problem.  Video editing and creativity will be graded.
3/27/20, 8:14 AM - Alex Starr: Plus I have to take an oral exam cuz I missed midterm 1
3/27/20, 8:14 AM - Matt Casali: Oh nooo
3/27/20, 8:15 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah I’m not happy about it and will definitely be getting ideas from you guys
3/27/20, 8:17 AM - Collin Hurst: Lmao
3/27/20, 8:17 AM - Collin Hurst: This is gonna be one for the books
3/27/20, 8:17 AM - Matt Casali: Only if you link them here
3/27/20, 8:17 AM - Matt Casali: You should do a dance
3/27/20, 8:19 AM - Alex Starr: I will share them with you guys.  Giving me likes improves my grade
3/27/20, 8:19 AM - Alex Starr: I’m not gonna dance
3/27/20, 8:20 AM - Matt Casali: Worth a try
3/27/20, 8:20 AM - Matt Casali: On my part, i mean
3/27/20, 8:41 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah haha
3/27/20, 8:41 AM - Alex Starr: I’m planning on putting it on the back burner til my exams/poster are over but then I’ll think more on it
3/27/20, 9:31 AM - Tim Ko: Oh my haha
3/27/20, 9:31 AM - Tim Ko: Oral math exam?? That’s insane haha
3/27/20, 9:34 AM - Parker: Lollll
3/27/20, 11:20 AM - Alex Starr: But now she sent a surprisingly heartfelt email about math education haha
3/27/20, 11:57 AM - Darren: Post the assignment instructions
3/27/20, 11:58 AM - Vaughn: That is incredible holy shit
3/27/20, 11:58 AM - Vaughn: Reach out to tiffany luther, get her to shout you out for more likes!
3/27/20, 12:37 PM - Alex Starr: Check out this.I’m assuming no one has made a TikTok video (much less a TikTok video on math!) I’m not expecting Hollywood level production. I do think there should be some editing involved because you can add finishing touches (captions, special effects, music, artwork, cartoons, maybe a Laurent series dance?🧐 I don’t know! Poetry, some computer program you wrote which graphs something,  etc) with editing. These finishing touches can be one way to make your videos creative. The possibilities are endless.
I clarified my definition of professional in the first announcement. Basically, I mean professional in the following sense: proofread to remove grammar and spelling errors, punctuation errors, typos, etc since you have the ability to edit your submissions.
Your target audience is students familiar with real analysis. Don’t spend time explaining Math 104 concepts in the videos. Don’t think of it as a video of you taking an exam (that’s not my intention). There are several TikTok vids of people solving puzzles/riddles. Think of this as your intent (just with Complex Analysis topics instead of regular brain teasers). Consider making your videos light hearted, as opposed to somber, affairs. Watch some TikTok videos to get a sense of TikTok culture. Our class will be bringing math to the masses!
I think there are many many many ways to be creative and I’ll be inclusive in my interpretation of creativity.
You don’t need to be in the entirety of each video- you just need to be visible long enough for me to recognize that it’s you.
It’s totally fine to use inspiration from other sources to create your own examples/problems. It’s not okay to regurgitate a fully worked out example from a textbook or website. You might even want to include some references in your vids.
This assignment can be very open ended, so don’t forget about time management. There’s no need to spend more time than what it would take you to study for and actually take a final. Let me know if you think your group could use more time. I can consider making the last homework optional and that could free up some time.
I would like for you to have fun creating the videos, or at least surprise yourself by  communicating math in novel ways. Think about which topics you’ve liked the most. Think about topics on which you would be interested in watching a short TikTok video.
Communication is fundamental in education. If you are able to share your videos with others that’s great! If you aren’t, it’s not a dealbreaker. I imagine if everybody puts their videos on Slack and everyone watches and likes other groups’ videos, each group  automatically has about 40 likes on each video. There is an amazing network of hardworking and good willed people just within our class.
3/27/20, 12:40 PM - Darren: Fuuuuuuck
3/27/20, 12:46 PM - Parker: oh my god
3/27/20, 12:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: what the actual fuck
3/27/20, 12:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: she's delirious from her 103 degree fever
3/27/20, 12:52 PM - Parker: For real

3/27/20, 1:15 PM - Tim Ko: Post it on some meme page
3/27/20, 1:25 PM - Alex Starr: It’s all because they banned zoom proctoring of exams over legal concerns
3/27/20, 2:04 PM - Darren: Wait, zoom had legal concerns but tiktok is ok?
3/27/20, 2:09 PM - Alex Starr: Zooming into your home is apparently an invasion of privacy.  I don’t think the tiktok thing is particularly widespread given there are 40 people in my class and ~1 professor crazy enough to do this
3/27/20, 2:11 PM - Parker: And apparently tiktok was the best alternative they could think of😂
3/27/20, 2:12 PM - Alex Starr: Desperate times call for tiktok
3/27/20, 2:12 PM - Parker: True
3/27/20, 2:13 PM - Parker: Also i was just thinking houseparty should make a comeback in times like these
3/27/20, 2:13 PM - Parker: we should all get it
3/27/20, 2:15 PM - Darren: Ok but the US government was literally looking into TikTok over data privacy and spyware concerns because they are majority owned by China
3/27/20, 2:21 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah I know
3/27/20, 2:25 PM - Tim Ko: Lol alex it’s already on the meme page
3/27/20, 2:26 PM - Tim Ko: <Media omitted>
3/27/20, 2:44 PM - Darren: I can feel the value of your degree decreasing Alex
3/27/20, 2:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: Time to dump your shares boys
3/27/20, 2:50 PM - Alex Starr: Eh grad schools are chill if I p/np all of them

3/27/20, 4:08 PM - Alex Starr: Idk
3/27/20, 4:08 PM - Alex Starr: Just something I heard
3/27/20, 4:10 PM - Tim Ko: Ah for sure
3/27/20, 4:11 PM - Tim Ko: I’ll prob ask the pre med advising at Berkeley and see if they have any info

3/30/20, 2:11 PM - Alex Starr: I can't do Friday as I have an exam 7:30-9:00 PM
3/30/20, 2:11 PM - Alex Starr: And it's a mathy one so I really shouldn't be drunk
3/30/20, 2:36 PM - Parker: happy hour =/ drunk
3/30/20, 2:36 PM - Parker: although no promises if we do one later at night
3/30/20, 2:38 PM - Alex Starr: True
3/30/20, 2:38 PM - Alex Starr: But I also shouldn't be doing anything pre exam
3/30/20, 2:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: Right maybe we do a 9pm kind of thing and you join after exam
3/30/20, 2:39 PM - Parker: haha yeah no i gotcha

3/30/20, 3:43 PM - Matt Casali: It was very hard to pay attention
3/30/20, 3:43 PM - Matt Casali: And I've been on a zoom call for work for the past 4 hours
3/30/20, 3:43 PM - Matt Casali: And I have to do it for 9 tomorrow!
3/30/20, 3:44 PM - Parker: Jeez

3/30/20, 3:54 PM - Collin Hurst: what
3/30/20, 3:57 PM - Darren: I guess that would be easy and useful
3/30/20, 3:57 PM - Darren: Did you research to see if this exists already?
3/30/20, 3:57 PM - Alex Starr: Nope
3/30/20, 3:57 PM - Alex Starr: Could pitch it as a way to deal with social distancing
3/30/20, 3:57 PM - Collin Hurst: probs does
3/30/20, 3:57 PM - Alex Starr: Then we should use it
3/30/20, 3:58 PM - Vaughn: Online poker with facecams at the table
3/30/20, 3:59 PM - Alex Starr: That is much more likely to exist
3/30/20, 4:00 PM - Vaughn: Havnt seen it yet
3/30/20, 4:01 PM - Darren: Online poker with facecams, but you can record video and loop it so people don't know if you're actually reacting at any given point and you have to be careful about what you say
3/30/20, 4:02 PM - Collin Hurst: or you can click on prerecorded reactions
3/30/20, 4:44 PM - Vaughn: <Media omitted>
3/30/20, 4:44 PM - Vaughn: Lets gooooooo!
3/30/20, 4:45 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeeeeeee

3/30/20, 6:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: They’re being dramatic
3/30/20, 6:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: Like when Matt says he’s permanently done with Abbey
3/30/20, 6:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: He doesn’t really mean it
3/30/20, 6:42 PM - Parker: Hahaha
3/30/20, 7:51 PM - Alex Starr: Update: the oral exam option seems to have been removed.  8 tik tok videos now constitute 60% of my grade.
3/30/20, 7:53 PM - Darren: This is the darkest timeline
3/30/20, 7:54 PM - Alex Starr: It’s horse shit
3/30/20, 7:54 PM - Alex Starr: It’s going to be more work for a worse grade and a less informative assignment and less knowledge of complex analysis
3/30/20, 10:27 PM - Tim Ko: Guys, we should all go to a basketball court and place horse through zoom
3/30/20, 10:27 PM - Tim Ko: Play

4/7/20, 10:53 AM - Matt Casali: So not as good as I really could be, ya know?
4/7/20, 10:53 AM - Parker: Wait did you guys all get tested?
4/7/20, 10:53 AM - Parker: yeah ifeel
4/7/20, 10:53 AM - Matt Casali: Haha no

4/7/20, 10:54 AM - Parker: wait what results? haha
4/7/20, 10:54 AM - Matt Casali: the herd meme

4/7/20, 10:55 AM - Parker: @14087310723
4/7/20, 10:55 AM - Parker: @14087310723
4/7/20, 10:55 AM - Matt Casali: staying up until 6 and he can't even give us the results
4/7/20, 10:55 AM - Matt Casali: sad.
4/7/20, 10:55 AM - Collin Hurst: Don’t @ me
4/7/20, 10:55 AM - Parker: ^
4/7/20, 10:55 AM - Collin Hurst: I actually went to bed at 2
4/7/20, 10:55 AM - Parker: ill continuously @ you
4/7/20, 10:55 AM - Collin Hurst: Woke up at 10
4/7/20, 10:55 AM - Matt Casali: Noiceee
4/7/20, 10:56 AM - Matt Casali: more time in the morning to send out those results!
4/7/20, 10:56 AM - Collin Hurst: Woohoo
4/7/20, 10:56 AM - Matt Casali: Also for anyone who has a switch at their quarantined household! Please get nintendo online so we can still play smash!
4/7/20, 11:00 AM - Collin Hurst: Eh
4/7/20, 11:00 AM - Collin Hurst: Are you gonna do IM Matt
4/7/20, 11:01 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah prob, it would be fun
4/7/20, 11:01 AM - Matt Casali: You?
4/7/20, 11:02 AM - Collin Hurst: Idk
4/7/20, 11:47 AM - Vaughn: <Media omitted>
4/7/20, 12:32 PM - Matt Casali: You should!
4/7/20, 12:34 PM - Matt Casali: 80
4/7/20, 12:36 PM - Ricky: 148
4/7/20, 12:44 PM - Alex Starr: 69^(69.69/69)
4/7/20, 1:02 PM - Darren: Honestly quarantine is pretty normal feeling for me
4/7/20, 1:03 PM - Alex Starr: It’s definitely off somehow though
4/7/20, 1:03 PM - Alex Starr: Apparently the virus can infect tigers
4/7/20, 1:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: and housecats
4/7/20, 1:05 PM - Alex Starr: I’m much more concerned about the tigers, but admittedly don’t have cats
4/7/20, 1:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: It'll probably just be the exotic pet ones that get infected
4/7/20, 1:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: Tiger king gang
4/7/20, 1:09 PM - Parker: Gang
4/7/20, 1:09 PM - Parker: yeah like 6 tested positive in the bronx zoo
4/7/20, 1:09 PM - Parker: but they’re fully recovering
4/7/20, 1:09 PM - Parker: how come?
4/7/20, 1:10 PM - Alex Starr: Why don’t I have cats?
4/7/20, 1:11 PM - Parker: No why concerned about tigers haha
4/7/20, 1:12 PM - Parker: or “much more” concerned
4/7/20, 1:12 PM - Matt Casali: Cause he hates cats haha
4/7/20, 1:12 PM - Alex Starr: Hates isn’t right
4/7/20, 1:13 PM - Alex Starr: Just they kill a lot of native species and spread a fairly nasty parasite that severely affects the immunocompromised
4/7/20, 1:14 PM - Parker: But tigers aren’t in human contact a lot are they?
4/7/20, 1:15 PM - Alex Starr: I meant housecats
4/7/20, 1:15 PM - Alex Starr: Tigers don’t do any of that
4/7/20, 1:15 PM - Parker: Ohh ok yeah that’s why i was confused why tigers were much more of a concern
4/7/20, 1:15 PM - Parker: Housecats for sure are
4/7/20, 1:16 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah housecats getting sick isn’t nearly as impactful as tigers getting sick (and dead feral cats is a win), but the potential to infect humans is real bad
4/7/20, 1:17 PM - Darren: Tigers are just slick as hell
4/7/20, 1:17 PM - Alex Starr: ^
4/7/20, 5:18 PM - Tim Ko: Wuhan just ended it’s lockdown today
4/7/20, 8:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: Gl with that
4/7/20, 8:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: They’ve been forcing people to go to work
4/7/20, 8:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: Looking at traffic data movement is up 80% and then on the weekends movement drops to -20%
4/7/20, 8:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: I don’t think it’s over for them
4/7/20, 8:12 PM - Alex Starr: There will likely be a second wave until we have a vaccine
4/7/20, 8:13 PM - Alex Starr: Although soon tests to see if you’ve had corona virus will be widely available so if you’ve had it you’re good to go
4/7/20, 8:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah looking forward to that
4/7/20, 8:45 PM - Alex Starr: The second wave or the test?
4/7/20, 9:18 PM - Jason Greenberg: Widespread testing
4/7/20, 9:24 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah would be kinda sweet to find out you’d already had it
4/7/20, 10:29 PM - Matt Casali: True
4/7/20, 11:17 PM - Vaughn: Woodland Explorer
4/7/20, 11:18 PM - Collin Hurst: weirdo
4/7/20, 11:18 PM - Matt Casali: No balls
4/7/20, 11:18 PM - Collin Hurst: what you mean
4/7/20, 11:25 PM - Parker: wat
4/7/20, 11:43 PM - Darren: <Media omitted>
4/7/20, 11:43 PM - Darren: RIP collin's free time activities
4/7/20, 11:57 PM - Parker: Ouch
4/8/20, 12:29 AM - Collin Hurst: Nah they just closed the parking lots
4/8/20, 12:29 AM - Collin Hurst: I still fish
4/8/20, 1:32 AM - Matt Casali: Please be a little more patient with lucas next time
4/8/20, 1:49 AM - Tim Ko: Aight our b Matt
4/8/20, 9:14 AM - Alex Starr: Yay sanders dropped out
4/8/20, 9:14 AM - Matt Casali: No prob! Just for next time
4/8/20, 9:17 AM - Parker: welp
4/8/20, 9:17 AM - Matt Casali: Yay we have an accused rapist!
4/8/20, 9:18 AM - Alex Starr: Better than trump winning
4/8/20, 9:18 AM - Parker: and someone who can’t speak words
4/8/20, 9:18 AM - Alex Starr: Which was more likely the longer sanders was in
4/8/20, 9:18 AM - Alex Starr: Regardless of whether you wanted sanders, at this point him staying in the race would only help trump
4/8/20, 9:25 AM - Parker: I know but also doesn’t mean he’s any more electable
4/8/20, 9:25 AM - Parker: That might’ve just sealed another four years for trump imho
4/8/20, 9:29 AM - Alex Starr: Idk trump is hardly eloquent and he won
4/8/20, 9:30 AM - Parker: yeah but he could literally do anything and his support base wouldn’t waver
4/8/20, 9:31 AM - Parker: i just don’t think enough dems will back biden bc people are stubborn
4/8/20, 9:32 AM - Parker: the fact that “not bernie” and “trump 4” are trending on twitter rn doesn’t make me feel confident
4/8/20, 9:37 AM - Alex Starr: I think the reverse
4/8/20, 9:41 AM - Parker: how come? ignoring the projections
4/8/20, 9:42 AM - Alex Starr: Sanders is too radical to get voters in the Midwest out in force and won’t get the black/Latino vote
4/8/20, 9:43 AM - Alex Starr: Sure sanders would win by a couple million more on the west coast, but that doesn’t matter.
4/8/20, 10:16 AM - Jason Greenberg: Woo!
4/8/20, 10:17 AM - Jason Greenberg: I’m forced choice it’s obvious who dems choose
4/8/20, 10:17 AM - Jason Greenberg: In forced choice*
4/8/20, 10:19 AM - Parker: yeah the diehard sanders supporters write in bernie or vote green which will fuck us
4/8/20, 10:23 AM - Tim Ko: I hope maybe Biden and Bernie can work together going forward
4/8/20, 10:24 AM - Alex Starr: That would be ideal.  Total endorsement and strong campaigning for Biden by sanders
4/8/20, 10:24 AM - Parker: true
4/8/20, 10:24 AM - Jason Greenberg: I'm not sure they would given that it would just divide the vote
4/8/20, 10:25 AM - Jason Greenberg: People who wanted Bernie also reeaaaaally didn't want trump
4/8/20, 10:25 AM - Parker: YeH i think bernie whole heartedly endorsing biden will prevent this for the most part
4/8/20, 10:25 AM - Parker: i just have seen some stubborn ass bernie supporters lol
4/8/20, 10:25 AM - Jason Greenberg: lol yeah
4/8/20, 10:25 AM - Parker: Where it’s bernie or bust
4/8/20, 10:26 AM - Parker: which is the mentality that will get trump 4 more years
4/8/20, 10:26 AM - Alex Starr: But that’s true for a lot of people for Biden as well.  Especially among African American voters
4/8/20, 10:26 AM - Parker: For the record, i’m not against biden i just have little faith in the american people
4/8/20, 10:26 AM - Parker: fair
4/8/20, 10:27 AM - Alex Starr: My lack of faith in the American people is why Biden over sanders for me haha
4/8/20, 11:38 AM - Parker: who do you guys want his VP to be?
4/8/20, 11:38 AM - Matt Casali: Probably gonna be Warren
4/8/20, 11:54 AM - Jason Greenberg: He already committed to a woman
4/8/20, 11:55 AM - Jason Greenberg: I’d bet warren too but I hope tulsi gabbard
4/8/20, 12:11 PM - Alex Starr: Klobuchar
4/8/20, 12:12 PM - Alex Starr: Want her then Biden to promptly die
4/8/20, 12:14 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
4/8/20, 12:14 PM - Tim Ko: Why doesn’t sanders have the support of African Americans?
4/8/20, 12:14 PM - Tim Ko: Thought they would like his social reforms
4/8/20, 12:25 PM - Darren: Yang gang round 2?
4/8/20, 12:26 PM - Parker: Yang’s tweets crack me up
4/8/20, 12:37 PM - Parker: Social media is making me lose more and more faith
4/8/20, 12:37 PM - Parker: so many people saying they will not vote for biden under any circumstances
4/8/20, 12:38 PM - Parker: (bernie people)
4/8/20, 12:50 PM - Alex Starr: Those are the loudest voices.  But it is absolutely a bummer than people can be so shortsighted/closed minded etc.
4/10/20, 10:55 AM - Parker: New york now has more cases than any other country
4/10/20, 10:56 AM - Parker: that’s nuts
4/10/20, 11:00 AM - Alex Starr: Go team!
4/10/20, 7:13 PM - Vaughn: Olympics officially postponed 😮
4/10/20, 7:17 PM - Alex Starr: Makes sense
4/12/20, 9:06 AM - Vaughn: <Media omitted>
4/12/20, 9:07 AM - Vaughn: At least i dont need a car for the next few months
4/12/20, 9:08 AM - Jason Greenberg: Bruh are you f ing kidding me??
4/12/20, 9:08 AM - Jason Greenberg: No note?!

4/12/20, 9:13 AM - Vaughn: Police are on patrol now
4/12/20, 10:11 AM - Jason Greenberg: Are they on the case?
4/12/20, 10:11 AM - Jason Greenberg: That’s suuucks Vaughn
4/12/20, 10:11 AM - Matt Casali: God damn Vaughn that's fucked
4/12/20, 10:11 AM - Matt Casali: I'm so sorry
4/12/20, 10:12 AM - Vaughn: Mucho fucked, playin phone tag with the insurance and parents

4/12/20, 10:20 AM - Parker: do they know what happened yet?
4/12/20, 10:25 AM - Jason Greenberg: I think someone hit him but yeah it’s up in the air
4/12/20, 10:27 AM - Vaughn: Twas a hit and run
4/12/20, 10:28 AM - Vaughn: They it so hard it bumped into my housemates car and onto the sidewalk
4/12/20, 10:28 AM - Alex Starr: That’s terrible.  Hopefully insurance works out well
4/12/20, 10:28 AM - Vaughn: Hopefully!
4/12/20, 10:28 AM - Vaughn: And the timing couldnt be better, no need for a car for a while
4/12/20, 10:29 AM - Parker: Haha i got that i just meant whether it was an accident or if someone intentionally rammed his car
4/12/20, 10:29 AM - Vaughn: Oh lol
4/12/20, 10:29 AM - Vaughn: Nah their gunna update me if they find the car that did it
4/12/20, 10:29 AM - Vaughn: Theyre
4/12/20, 10:34 AM - Matt Casali: Intentionally ram his car?
4/12/20, 10:35 AM - Jason Greenberg: Do we know if he rammed it or bammed it?
4/12/20, 10:35 AM - Matt Casali: Or slammed it
4/12/20, 10:36 AM - Vaughn: Ive caused some bad blood here in the og sc, i wouldnt be surprised
4/12/20, 10:37 AM - Matt Casali: It was nick
4/12/20, 10:37 AM - Matt Casali: He never got over you completely disgracing him in smash
4/12/20, 10:37 AM - Vaughn: On a scale from 1 - rambammed id give it 3 doug dimmadamns
4/12/20, 10:38 AM - Matt Casali: Hahaha
4/12/20, 10:38 AM - Jason Greenberg: Hahah

4/12/20, 10:39 AM - Vaughn: https://youtu.be/ts5af0aFcuw
4/12/20, 10:39 AM - Parker: vs unintentionally
4/12/20, 10:40 AM - Parker: Lol
4/12/20, 11:06 AM - Tim Ko: Damn dude I’m sorry vaughn :((
4/12/20, 11:07 AM - Tim Ko: That’s so messed up
4/12/20, 11:07 AM - Tim Ko: With the amount of cars on the road nowadays, there is some chance that they find them
4/12/20, 11:08 AM - Jason Greenberg: Lolol
4/12/20, 11:09 AM - Ricky: Ur the only one that has powe over it
4/12/20, 11:09 AM - Ricky: Oops
4/12/20, 11:09 AM - Parker: hopefully SC police actually follows up with you. some dude ripped my side mirror off in eugene back in the fall and i filed a report and everything and the eugene PD never followed up with me
4/12/20, 11:11 AM - Tim Ko: Aww dang :(( yeah I bet chances are higher now that police don’t have as much cases
4/12/20, 11:11 AM - Jason Greenberg: He must have owned an ass haberdashery
4/12/20, 11:12 AM - Jason Greenberg: My side mirror is held on with tape for the same reason
4/12/20, 11:13 AM - Parker: Damn
4/12/20, 11:13 AM - Ricky: Dang :( IM sorry Vaughn and all with car troubles
4/12/20, 11:13 AM - Parker: yeah i got it fixed but pretty shitty considering the dude essentially got off with no consequence of doing it
4/12/20, 11:19 AM - Vaughn: He has to live with being a shitty person, itll even out eventually
4/12/20, 11:22 AM - Collin Hurst: Goddamn
4/12/20, 11:22 AM - Vaughn: Whoa youre up early
4/12/20, 11:22 AM - Collin Hurst: Yep
4/12/20, 11:36 AM - Tim Ko: ^
4/12/20, 11:36 AM - Tim Ko: Justice will prevail
4/12/20, 11:37 AM - Tim Ko: Everytime collin goes through minor BS inconveniences, I’d like to think it’s dhingra dicking him over for missing his shift that one time
4/12/20, 11:39 AM - Tim Ko: Collin got up early for Easter Sunday
4/12/20, 11:39 AM - Collin Hurst: Ye gotta get them eggs
4/12/20, 11:39 AM - Collin Hurst: The hunt starts at 12
4/12/20, 11:39 AM - Tim Ko: Save me some
4/12/20, 12:02 PM - Parker: in my case the dude did it in front of his kid so i feel worse for his kid/would want some reprimanding for that reason
4/12/20, 12:02 PM - Parker: He left a note when he did it saying “this is for parking too close to my car so i couldn’t get my son in his seat”
4/12/20, 12:13 PM - Tim Ko: Nothing beats alex giving a dude a love tap in the Safeway parking lot as he is walking to his car
4/12/20, 12:14 PM - Parker: Hahaha true
4/12/20, 12:14 PM - Parker: All time herd moment
4/12/20, 12:14 PM - Ricky: Lmao
4/12/20, 12:14 PM - Ricky: That dude was PISSED
4/12/20, 12:15 PM - Tim Ko: ^
4/12/20, 12:15 PM - Tim Ko: Haha ikr, I vividly remember his facial expression
4/12/20, 12:16 PM - Parker: there was no stopping alex either lol we all told him he wouldn’t make the turn and he just went for it
4/12/20, 12:16 PM - Tim Ko: It was a combo of shock, disapproval, and a little bit off anger
4/12/20, 12:16 PM - Tim Ko: Lolol
4/12/20, 12:17 PM - Tim Ko: Alex was determined
4/12/20, 12:17 PM - Tim Ko: “Who can stop me?”
4/12/20, 12:17 PM - Tim Ko: - alex probably
4/12/20, 12:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hahah
4/12/20, 12:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lmaoo
4/13/20, 3:40 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
4/13/20, 4:20 PM - Alex Starr: I am hyped
4/13/20, 9:18 PM - Collin Hurst: You seem pretty hyped
4/13/20, 9:22 PM - Alex Starr: You bet
4/14/20, 1:47 AM - Parker: <Media omitted>
4/14/20, 1:48 AM - Collin Hurst: Tru but why he say that
4/14/20, 2:11 AM - Tim Ko: #shah 2020
4/14/20, 9:42 AM - Parker: Lol beats me
4/14/20, 9:42 AM - Parker: his twitter is just him stating very obvious things haha
4/14/20, 9:44 AM - Tim Ko: Not much different from our current prez
4/14/20, 9:45 AM - Alex Starr: Pretty different
4/14/20, 9:46 AM - Parker: ^
4/14/20, 9:46 AM - Parker: Rushil doesn’t lie atleast
4/14/20, 2:33 PM - Tim Ko: It’s funny, for one of my class the quarantine has deterred people from cheating I think. The problem set class averages went way down from low 90s to mid 70s. For this class, ur not actually allowed to work on problems together, only allowed to discuss general concepts
4/14/20, 2:37 PM - Darren: Everything is online p/np by default so people may just care less about getting top marks
4/14/20, 2:41 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah that too
4/14/20, 3:31 PM - Alex Starr: Probably the larger factor
4/14/20, 3:31 PM - Alex Starr: The best anti cheating option is to make everything tiktoks
4/14/20, 3:54 PM - Vaughn: Oh shit hows that going alex?
4/14/20, 3:56 PM - Alex Starr: The assignment is constantly changing
4/14/20, 3:56 PM - Alex Starr: But I’m pretty set on what I’ll do
4/14/20, 3:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: You better post your handle here when you upload
4/14/20, 3:57 PM - Alex Starr: I convinced her to let me just email them to her
4/14/20, 3:57 PM - Ricky: Boooo hah
4/14/20, 3:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’d still like a bcc
4/14/20, 4:33 PM - Parker: ^
4/14/20, 4:47 PM - Alex Starr: I’ll definitely share.  Fair warning they will be boring.  I went with poetry as my creative aspect cuz nothing says entertainment like complex analysis and poetry
4/14/20, 4:49 PM - Matt Casali: Oo I'm excited
4/14/20, 5:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: As you get close you should give us a release date so we can get adequately hyped
4/14/20, 5:11 PM - Matt Casali: ^
4/14/20, 5:13 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
4/14/20, 5:13 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
4/14/20, 5:14 PM - Matt Casali: *dune
4/14/20, 5:14 PM - Darren: No one gives a fuck
4/14/20, 5:14 PM - Vaughn: Is that zendaya?
4/14/20, 5:15 PM - Darren: Yeah
4/14/20, 5:15 PM - Vaughn: K
4/14/20, 5:15 PM - Vaughn: K maybe a sprinkle of hype
4/14/20, 5:16 PM - Matt Casali: Hey
4/14/20, 5:19 PM - Collin Hurst: cool pics I guess
4/14/20, 5:33 PM - Parker: ^
4/14/20, 5:34 PM - Collin Hurst: hype is a strong word for this circumstance
4/14/20, 5:35 PM - Alex Starr: I’ll bring enough hype for all of you
4/14/20, 5:38 PM - Alex Starr: Apparently they made Liet a woman.  Not sure how I feel about it.  Will definitely be jarring at first I think.
4/14/20, 5:44 PM - Parker: Zendaya just increased it ever so slightly but .00001 x 0 = 0 i guess
4/17/20, 1:54 AM - Tim Ko: If Covid-19 doesn’t take you out, can I?
4/17/20, 1:56 AM - Darren: No I'm ok
4/17/20, 1:57 AM - Tim Ko: 😞
4/17/20, 10:50 AM - Parker: Draft day!!! Get hyped everyone! The goat will be drafted first overall in the wnba draft around 4pm
4/17/20, 10:50 AM - Parker: y’all should tune in
4/17/20, 11:53 AM - Tim Ko: Lmao
4/17/20, 11:53 AM - Tim Ko: I was like, I thought the nfl Draft was next week
4/17/20, 11:54 AM - Parker: Lol true, two goats being drafted this month

4/17/20, 12:24 PM - Tim Ko: One time I was watching sportscenter and at the bottom was a headline that read “famous WNBA player will miss the rest of the season” and then usually it ends with a parenthesis of what injury they have. So I was expecting to ready like torn acl or something like that but instead it said “pregnant”
4/17/20, 12:24 PM - Tim Ko: Then I was like, oh shit forgot that was a thing lol
4/17/20, 12:25 PM - Parker: that women get pregnant?
4/17/20, 12:27 PM - Tim Ko: Or like that would be an issue for women’s pro sports

4/18/20, 4:35 PM - Matt Casali: Fuck you're right
4/18/20, 4:36 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah it was a pretty chill night
4/18/20, 4:42 PM - Parker: That’s cool
4/18/20, 4:42 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah I'd definitely want to try again
4/18/20, 4:43 PM - Parker: who woulda thunk the man who was against alcohol 5 years ago ended up doing more drugs than anyone else in the herd haha
4/18/20, 4:43 PM - Parker: the santa cruz effect
4/18/20, 4:44 PM - Matt Casali: Haha I think about that a lot
4/18/20, 4:44 PM - Alex Starr: I was gonna say Matt needs to a long look at his senior thesis
4/18/20, 4:45 PM - Matt Casali: It's like those Christian kids who grow up in really strict households and then really dive into the deep end in college
4/18/20, 4:46 PM - Alex Starr: Except you weren’t raised super Christian and just kinda experimented occasionally with party drugs
4/18/20, 4:48 PM - Matt Casali: I actually had a 3 month long fight with opioids so mind your own business please
4/18/20, 4:49 PM - Parker: yeah i wouldn’t call an mdma addiction “experimenting”
4/18/20, 4:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
4/18/20, 4:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: Weeerr?
4/18/20, 4:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: I will say I was surprised about the mdma but only cuz you didn’t saying anything at the time
4/18/20, 4:51 PM - Collin Hurst: is mdma the same as molly
4/18/20, 4:51 PM - Parker: ^
4/18/20, 4:51 PM - Parker: yeah
4/18/20, 4:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yes
4/18/20, 4:52 PM - Alex Starr: MDMA = ecstasy?
4/18/20, 4:52 PM - Parker: methaldoxy whTever the fook it’s called
4/18/20, 4:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: If anyone says they aren’t or it’s more pure they are the biggest moron you have ever met in your goddamn short life
4/18/20, 4:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yes
4/18/20, 4:52 PM - Alex Starr: Wow.  I’ve heard if you do that more than once a year it seriously fucks up your brain
4/18/20, 4:52 PM - Alex Starr: My source is coke addicted neuro pre med
4/18/20, 4:52 PM - Alex Starr: Is a*
4/18/20, 4:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: 3,4-Methyl​enedioxy​methamphetamine
4/18/20, 4:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: It may be neurotoxic we aren’t sure
4/18/20, 4:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: Blood activity across the whole brain decreases for like 3 weeks after taking it
4/18/20, 4:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: And the mechanisms for how it works in the brain seem fucked up
4/18/20, 4:54 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah most things I saw said waiting about a month or two between using it
4/18/20, 4:54 PM - Alex Starr: Well it’s certainly neuro something then haha
4/18/20, 4:54 PM - Matt Casali: It messes up serotonin levels big time
4/18/20, 4:54 PM - Matt Casali: You're usually big depressed the next couple days after
4/18/20, 4:54 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah and serotonin is kind of a big one
4/18/20, 4:54 PM - Matt Casali: Mhm
4/18/20, 4:55 PM - Alex Starr: Some call it the dopamine of the future
4/18/20, 4:55 PM - Alex Starr: Gut*
4/18/20, 5:08 PM - Ricky: My roommate does it at all his raves and has vitamins on deck for the whole week on his comedown
4/18/20, 5:08 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah I don’t think those increase serotonin levels
4/18/20, 5:08 PM - Ricky: And yeah, he said it makes you just sad and feel little emotions for a few weeks depending on how well you rest and how much you recover
4/18/20, 5:08 PM - Ricky: I think it’s for the rest of the body
4/18/20, 5:08 PM - Ricky: Just so everything is running smoothly
4/18/20, 5:09 PM - Ricky: Idk, he just swears by using vitamins on comedown
4/18/20, 5:22 PM - Jason Greenberg: Surprisingly some antidepressants that lower serotonin levels are effective too
4/18/20, 5:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: Which suggests that dysfunction caused by changes in serotonin aren’t only from “too low” serotonin
4/18/20, 5:24 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah, but long term depression of serotonin levels probably isn’t good especially if you aren’t suffering from abnormal serotonin levels
4/18/20, 5:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’m wondering if that’s true
4/18/20, 5:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: But you’re probably right
4/18/20, 10:54 PM - Parker: Donya visiting collin🤨🤨
4/18/20, 10:54 PM - Parker: smh
4/18/20, 10:55 PM - Vaughn: biiiig smh

4/18/20, 11:05 PM - Vaughn: Biiiiig eyebrow raise for the other reasons
4/18/20, 11:21 PM - Collin Hurst: Can’t say we kept to 6ft the whole time but we never touched so that’s a dub
4/18/20, 11:21 PM - Matt Casali: Wait tf?

4/18/20, 11:25 PM - Collin Hurst: nah we just walked down west cliff and she watched me eat a burrito
4/18/20, 11:25 PM - Collin Hurst: And she tried our home brew
4/18/20, 11:26 PM - Parker: That’s not the point
4/18/20, 11:27 PM - Parker: she shouldn’t be coming to santa cruz
4/18/20, 11:27 PM - Collin Hurst: True
4/18/20, 11:27 PM - Vaughn: Collin wouldnt even have me over :(
4/18/20, 11:27 PM - Collin Hurst: She tested negative a week ago so we felt better about it
4/18/20, 11:27 PM - Vaughn: I wish i could try the homebrew :((

4/18/20, 11:29 PM - Parker: But she could’ve contracted it since then
4/18/20, 11:30 PM - Parker: And if social media is any indicator, it’s not the first time she’s left her house this quarantine lol
4/18/20, 11:30 PM - Parker: no shade though
4/18/20, 11:31 PM - Collin Hurst: I was just more worried of giving it to her
4/18/20, 11:32 PM - Collin Hurst: You guys should have seen west cliff today, it was super weird everyone walking around like normal and there was 100 surfers out I bet they close it again
4/18/20, 11:33 PM - Tim Ko: Does she still have a boyfriend?
4/18/20, 11:34 PM - Tim Ko: Collin I just looked at her snap story

4/25/20, 1:59 PM - Matt Casali: Going down highway 1 and there are thousands of people going to the beaches so not looking like that's coming for a while haha
4/25/20, 2:03 PM - Parker: go throw bleach bottles at them
4/25/20, 2:24 PM - Collin Hurst: There’s a lot of beaches that have small parking lots but a lot of space so definitely an option
4/25/20, 2:25 PM - Collin Hurst: I also happen to know some secret beaches now after spending so much time looking for fishing spots lol
4/25/20, 2:25 PM - Matt Casali: But some parking lots are closed and people are just parking on the side of the highway
4/25/20, 2:26 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah but that’s still less people than if the lots were full
4/25/20, 2:27 PM - Collin Hurst: It’s deceiving tho cause a huge beach like Laguna Creek has 4x the space of Bonny doon and a 1/4 of the parking space of bonny doon
4/25/20, 2:30 PM - Matt Casali: I mean there's still more people than usual from what I can tell
4/25/20, 2:32 PM - Collin Hurst: True
4/25/20, 2:32 PM - Collin Hurst: For sure

4/30/20, 9:42 PM - Collin Hurst: idk how rachel got my dad to put her as independent
4/30/20, 9:42 PM - Parker: doesn’t that mean she did her own taxes last year?

4/30/20, 9:46 PM - Alex Starr: But don’t have anything
4/30/20, 9:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: Don’t have anything?
4/30/20, 9:51 PM - Collin Hurst: ^?
4/30/20, 9:51 PM - Alex Starr: No stimulus checks I mean
4/30/20, 10:10 PM - Parker: Then there must be more criteria then
4/30/20, 10:10 PM - Parker: but all i know is i ain’t getting one

5/1/20, 10:44 AM - Alex Starr: There’d probably be some pretty heavy violence
5/1/20, 10:44 AM - Jason Greenberg: If it's true it's pretty much a coin flip whether this is good or bad for us.
5/1/20, 10:44 AM - Alex Starr: I like those odds
5/1/20, 10:46 AM - Alex Starr: I think Jason put it best when he said “she’s not even hot”
5/1/20, 3:10 PM - Vaughn: Did we ever get those results?
5/1/20, 3:18 PM - Jason Greenberg: Smh

5/8/20, 10:55 PM - Tim Ko: Today was my last gathering for my Christian fellowship and as one of the seniors I led a song, I decided, well ive always wanted to try singing falsetto and this could be one of my last chance leading worship so I put it in a key with high notes. I practiced for a couple hours and was able to hit the notes, but when it came time, I got super super nervous and just couldn’t support the falsetto too well lol. Luckily it was over zoom so it wasn’t too awkward 😅. One of those times where I’m kinda embarrassed but I’m glad I tried it

5/16/20, 7:06 AM - Ricky: Okay, I ain’t a guy who has strong political stances or likes to start convos about it cuz I’m usually not educated enough to develop a strong opinion that I can back with facts but living with a doctor for the last two months who has been telling about me about what could happen if everything went south made me actually laugh at this news cast that showed up on my feed. Like it feels so weird and sad to watch this news cast, and know that it’s real and to see the comments and that so many people are so dumb and buy into it or that make individuals who believe in distancing look like people that just wanna turn the us “into China” idk, just makes both the left and the right look like fucken stupid ass pieces of shit but I guess that’s YouTube comments for you? Idk, just made me feel gross experiencing this. Like it’s literally reporting where they accuse a lack of science while showing 0 science, and exclusively utilizing random ass accusations about the mayor as reasons why things are going it, it’s just hard to believe a real national news station can exist operate, and profit while spewing this actually laughable shit
5/16/20, 7:07 AM - Ricky: Okay, weird morning rant over, Miss you boys
5/16/20, 7:33 AM - Jason Greenberg: Are you suggesting that saying someone’s decisions are driven by the pure animal joy of controlling other people’s lives somehow contains bias?
5/16/20, 7:44 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah Ricky it’s also pretty much the case with everything.  People are not data driven and easily manipulated by and large.
5/16/20, 7:46 AM - Alex Starr: It’s also interesting to think about how this is affecting India, Bangladesh, Africa etcetera
5/18/20, 3:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: <Media omitted>

5/19/20, 6:29 AM - Alex Starr: Nice
5/19/20, 12:23 PM - Alex Starr: Had my appointment.  Unclear what is causing my issues.  She didn’t think it’s ms.  I will get an mri soonish.  They also ordered blood tests for autoimmune, inflammatory, and diabetes stuff.  She seemed to think it would be unlikely that we find anything.  Neurological exam was normal except for reflex issues on my right side.
5/19/20, 12:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hmmm
5/19/20, 12:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: Have you had an mri before?
5/19/20, 12:25 PM - Alex Starr: I’ve had 5
5/19/20, 12:25 PM - Alex Starr: Hardest part is not falling asleep haha
5/19/20, 12:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh damn haha
5/19/20, 12:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah the scientists don’t like that
5/19/20, 12:27 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah it was cuz I participated in a study
5/19/20, 12:28 PM - Alex Starr: Even when doing the task I almost fell asleep
5/19/20, 12:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Berkeley mri > Stanford mri in terms of overall experience imo
5/19/20, 12:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: Berkeley had more memory foam and better earplugs
5/19/20, 12:29 PM - Alex Starr: Interesting
5/19/20, 12:29 PM - Ricky: Alex!!! My mom said to look into Meistinia Gravis
5/19/20, 12:29 PM - Alex Starr: I think I agree
5/19/20, 12:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: Pro move is being your own ear plugs
5/19/20, 12:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: bringing*
5/19/20, 12:29 PM - Ricky: Apperently a totally curable disease that causes a lot of the things you’ve been describing
5/19/20, 12:30 PM - Alex Starr: Hmmm I don’t really have weakness
5/19/20, 12:31 PM - Ricky: You said doing repetitive things was a no go
5/19/20, 12:31 PM - Ricky: And tought you said it made you tired
5/19/20, 12:31 PM - Alex Starr: Yes it does
5/19/20, 12:31 PM - Ricky: Well that’s what I told my mom
5/19/20, 12:31 PM - Ricky: And she said check this out haha
5/19/20, 12:31 PM - Alex Starr: I’m pretty sure that the autoimmune check thing will include that one

5/19/20, 12:32 PM - Ricky: Cool cool just thought I’d give ya anything I got
5/19/20, 12:32 PM - Alex Starr: I appreciate it for sure
5/19/20, 12:33 PM - Alex Starr: I’ve been trying to avoid the Mayo Clinic website cuz like everything causes my symptoms haha
5/19/20, 12:34 PM - Alex Starr: That’s an interesting disease
5/19/20, 12:35 PM - Alex Starr: She also said that stress and depression like symptoms can cause a lot of these things or exacerbate them and I seem to be struggling with some combination of both
5/19/20, 12:48 PM - Ricky: What’s dat?
5/19/20, 12:48 PM - Ricky: And damn, that deff ain’t good for the body, don’t forget ya got us here

5/19/20, 12:58 PM - Parker: or is that too late
5/19/20, 12:58 PM - Alex Starr: Most medicine in Texas is either walking it off or a bullet.  Both are cheap
5/19/20, 12:58 PM - Parker: Lol
5/19/20, 12:58 PM - Parker: i think i was thinking of the big cancer clinic in houston? is that right
5/19/20, 12:59 PM - Parker: i know there’s some significant medical center in texas lol
5/19/20, 12:59 PM - Alex Starr: Idk

5/19/20, 1:11 PM - Alex Starr: I’d definitely show up at 8:00
5/19/20, 1:12 PM - Alex Starr: 9:00 is iffy because I’ve been having so much trouble sleeping
5/19/20, 1:18 PM - Parker: Ah ok then yeah i’m down for 8

5/19/20, 6:46 PM - Vaughn: I didnt come around to making a new round yet, but would love to set one up this week!
5/19/20, 6:46 PM - Alex Starr: Sounds good
5/19/20, 6:47 PM - Vaughn: If we were thinking of doing herd questions, maybe everyone could send me 5 questions and answers for themselves
5/19/20, 6:48 PM - Alex Starr: Wait how would it work?
5/19/20, 6:49 PM - Vaughn: We could just play normally, you just arent allowed to buzz in for your own questions
5/19/20, 6:49 PM - Alex Starr: Oh no I mean like what would the questions be
5/19/20, 7:33 PM - Matt Casali: What time?
5/19/20, 7:34 PM - Matt Casali: Also down for jeopardy submissions!
5/19/20, 7:34 PM - Matt Casali: It would be cool if you chose a couple categories and then we each took one and came up with questions
5/19/20, 7:36 PM - Alex Starr: 8:00 i believe
5/19/20, 7:38 PM - Matt Casali: Okeydoje
5/19/20, 7:39 PM - Alex Starr: But in all honesty it’ll be later if I had to guess
5/19/20, 7:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: Could we send them about other people?
5/19/20, 7:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’m confused
5/19/20, 7:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: ^
5/19/20, 7:49 PM - Alex Starr: That’s what confused me as well
5/19/20, 7:50 PM - Vaughn: To make it simple i think yall should just send 5 questions about yourself
5/19/20, 7:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’m not just here to flex about my resistance bands training in the form of jeopardy questions
5/19/20, 7:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ok if we do that then can we send more about other people
5/19/20, 7:50 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah I think we should be randomly assigned other people
5/19/20, 7:50 PM - Vaughn: Id hope you come up with questions that most of us have a chance of knowing lol
5/19/20, 7:50 PM - Alex Starr: And not do them about ourselves
5/19/20, 7:51 PM - Vaughn: Maybe a baseline of 5 for yourself, then send as many about other people as you want
5/19/20, 7:51 PM - Collin Hurst: Can’t join tn, fuck 103

5/22/20, 4:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: If I want to plug my computer into ethernet, can I just plug it into one of the ethernet ports in a wall
5/22/20, 4:05 PM - Matt Casali: I think so!
5/22/20, 4:05 PM - Ricky: you gotta pick it in your settings
5/22/20, 4:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: or do I need to plug it directly into the router
5/22/20, 4:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: which settings
5/22/20, 4:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: router or computer

5/22/20, 4:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: right thats what i'm wondering
5/22/20, 4:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: cuz router is plugged in the other room to the wall
5/22/20, 4:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: and there is a port in the bedroom
5/22/20, 4:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: so does that mean I can just plug in and we gucci

5/22/20, 4:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: I think theoretically
5/22/20, 5:05 PM - Collin Hurst: There should be a breaker somewhere that routes your internet to the different ports around the house
5/22/20, 5:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ok great
5/22/20, 5:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah there is
5/22/20, 5:05 PM - Collin Hurst: My house had a network cabinet like that
5/22/20, 5:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: I'm not at my apt any more but gonna try it out tomorrow
5/22/20, 5:06 PM - Collin Hurst: There should be labels and make sure there’s one connected to the port of the room you’re connecting into

5/26/20, 9:27 AM - Alex Starr: That’s awesome also Ricky.  What inspired it?
5/26/20, 9:29 AM - Parker: I looked into grad school a bit more too but didn’t end up applying anywhere, i think more people who would normally find a job after grad are looking into it more because of the job market
5/26/20, 9:30 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah definitely.  It’s gonna be brutal for grad school after this year I think but hopefully not too bad this year.  Was wondering if he’d been thinking about it more before the virus
5/26/20, 9:40 AM - Jason Greenberg: Lol
5/26/20, 10:21 AM - Ricky: was debating it before hand but the virus definitely kicked it up a notch.
5/26/20, 10:21 AM - Ricky: this is the only one im likely gonna apply to considering deadlines
5/26/20, 10:21 AM - Alex Starr: Cool
5/26/20, 10:21 AM - Alex Starr: What’s the program like? What doors does it open?
5/26/20, 10:21 AM - Ricky: apparently the average gpa is 3.3 which is ez money, but also most people are 27 with 26 months of experiences not including internships haha
5/26/20, 10:22 AM - Ricky: biggest thing they advertise is connections in silicon valley
5/26/20, 10:22 AM - Collin Hurst: Yeah rick I got one for you
5/26/20, 10:22 AM - Ricky: as for me personally I want to get more specialized in analytics
5/26/20, 10:22 AM - Ricky: and Santa Clara lets me do that while living at home lol
5/26/20, 10:23 AM - Parker: ganggg
5/26/20, 10:23 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah it’s a sweet deal
5/26/20, 10:23 AM - Parker: what specifically attracted you to their program?
5/26/20, 10:23 AM - Parker: or was it mostly location
5/26/20, 10:24 AM - Ricky: location and connections and availability ahah
5/26/20, 10:25 AM - Ricky: doesn't seem impossible to get in to
5/26/20, 10:25 AM - Ricky: know people that go, seems like a p good school
5/26/20, 10:25 AM - Ricky: they deff got a shit ton of silicon valley high ups helping with the curriculum which is cool
5/26/20, 10:41 AM - Ricky: In my four years in undergrad a single concept has emerged as a unifying truth in my pursuit of academic success: I love analytics. Everything I engage in is connect to my analytical mindset; I use it to find success as well as problem solve.  With the amazing opportunity that a Master’s in Business Analytics at Santa Clara University could offer my future as a professional business leader, it would be a calamity for canceled standardized testing to be the barrier to entry. Not only am I certain that pursuing a masters at Santa Clara University could benefit my future but I believe I could be a valuable resource to the program. Coming fresh out of undergrad I am thirsty for knowledge, prepared to take chances, and ready to put myself out there in order to maximize my educational potential. I pride myself on my diversity and the ability to connect with others and think my addition to Santa Clara would benefit both the cohesiveness and transparent communication of the classroom setting. Most of all I have been working hard to achieve academic excellence as I narrowed down my studies on the subject I find most alluring: Analytics.
5/26/20, 10:42 AM - Ricky: I gotta turn in a 200 word thing about why I should be waived from taking the GRE/GMAT (I haven't done it) so if anyone wants to take a look and give some critiques I would appreciate it
5/26/20, 11:07 AM - Alex Starr: If you share it with me or email it to me I’d be happy to
5/26/20, 11:15 AM - Ricky: dope imma throw you on a google doc that I working with grace if thats cool
5/26/20, 11:17 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah sounds good

5/28/20, 3:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: got your letters?
5/28/20, 3:52 PM - Tim Ko: I thought the sign on the freeway was just the OG sign for Stanford lol
5/28/20, 3:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: haha
5/28/20, 3:52 PM - Tim Ko: Got 4 out of 5, but I can still submit without them
5/28/20, 3:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: I'll be able to get lunch with Alex if I get in
5/28/20, 3:52 PM - Tim Ko: Ooo nice
5/28/20, 3:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: holy fuck 5 letters are you kidding
5/28/20, 3:52 PM - Tim Ko: How many schools u applying to?
5/28/20, 3:53 PM - Tim Ko: Haha yeah, that’s like the average for med
5/28/20, 3:53 PM - Tim Ko: 3 is minimum
5/28/20, 3:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: I'm literally only applying to the one for this cycle cuz it's the only one I was interested that extended their deadline for the coming year
5/28/20, 3:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: If I get in I won't need to gap year, if I don't gap year ahoy
5/28/20, 3:54 PM - Tim Ko: Ohhh I see
5/28/20, 3:54 PM - Tim Ko: Wait that’s dope
5/28/20, 3:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: damn we have 3 max
5/28/20, 3:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: I don't even know 5 people haha
5/28/20, 3:55 PM - Tim Ko: So like this is kinda like ur house money year
5/28/20, 3:55 PM - Tim Ko: Haha I had to ask some professors I didn’t know too well
5/28/20, 3:56 PM - Parker: I’ve always seen that sign too lol
5/28/20, 3:56 PM - Tim Ko: But yeah, I started trying to connect with potential LORs starting spring of junior year
5/28/20, 3:56 PM - Parker: where is the school?
5/28/20, 3:57 PM - Tim Ko: If I was a betting man, I’d say Palo Alto 😆
5/28/20, 3:57 PM - Parker: no way
5/28/20, 3:58 PM - Parker: where specifically lol
5/28/20, 3:58 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah that I don’t know
5/28/20, 3:58 PM - Tim Ko: Looks like page mill road on the hill side of 280
5/28/20, 3:59 PM - Tim Ko: Dang it’s specifically for psychology, pretty cool
5/28/20, 4:02 PM - Alex Starr: One of my letters was from a prof who I hadn’t spoken to for a letter
5/28/20, 4:06 PM - Tim Ko: Wut like u never asked him/her for a letter?
5/28/20, 4:07 PM - Alex Starr: No I asked him in person but up to that point hadn’t spoken to him
5/28/20, 4:12 PM - Tim Ko: Ahh I remember u telling me I think
5/28/20, 4:12 PM - Tim Ko: Well his letter helped get u into Stanford!
5/28/20, 4:12 PM - Tim Ko: Must been decent
5/28/20, 4:12 PM - Tim Ko: Musta
5/28/20, 4:28 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah no I think he wrote a good one
5/28/20, 4:28 PM - Alex Starr: Honestly the best move is to just ask professors in order of fame
5/28/20, 4:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah I should've asked my Stanford P.I. but it's too late for me
5/28/20, 4:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: He has 100,000+ citations on google scholar
5/28/20, 4:33 PM - Alex Starr: Ask him for next year holy fuck
5/28/20, 4:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah if I don't get in this time I will
5/28/20, 4:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: His name is on my CV but I know it's not the same
5/28/20, 4:34 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah a good rec letter from a very famous PI is better than a paper imo
5/28/20, 4:35 PM - Alex Starr: Or at least comparable
5/28/20, 4:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah definitely a missed opportunity
5/28/20, 4:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: Are you going to get RAs and stuff?
5/28/20, 4:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: Cuz that would be dope
5/28/20, 4:43 PM - Alex Starr: RAs?
5/28/20, 4:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: research assistants
5/28/20, 4:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: underlings
5/28/20, 4:43 PM - Alex Starr: Oh maybe
5/28/20, 4:43 PM - Alex Starr: Depends on me
5/28/20, 4:43 PM - Alex Starr: And my pi
5/28/20, 4:43 PM - Alex Starr: They are a lot of work
5/28/20, 5:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: I see
5/28/20, 5:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: What's your start date again?
5/28/20, 5:38 PM - Alex Starr: Sep 14
5/28/20, 5:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: oh damn you got a while
5/28/20, 5:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: anything to be done beforehand?
5/28/20, 5:48 PM - Alex Starr: Not really
5/28/20, 6:02 PM - Parker: a whole lotta gang shit that’s what
5/28/20, 6:11 PM - Tim Ko: Lolol facts
5/29/20, 7:17 AM - Parker: 4 years ago today, Alex died an American hero
5/29/20, 7:18 AM - Parker: <Media omitted>
5/29/20, 10:10 AM - Tim Ko: GANG
5/29/20, 10:12 AM - Tim Ko: I randomly bumped into Sam like in February and we chatted for a bit and I wanted to catch up and asked her when she was free for lunch. She said she’d check her schedule and get back to me but she never did rip lol
5/29/20, 10:12 AM - Jason Greenberg: RIIIP
5/29/20, 10:12 AM - Jason Greenberg: haha
5/29/20, 10:27 AM - Parker: awww rip😂
5/29/20, 4:18 PM - Ricky: Yessirrrrr
5/30/20, 8:38 AM - Alex Starr: Hey guys, thanks so much for the masterclass subscription! Hopefully it’ll help keep me sane and I’m looking forward to diving in soon.  Also, here’s an update on my health.  Good news: most of symptoms are gone.  Bad news: I still occasionally feel mentally foggy/have a headache.  Baaaaad news:  my legs are not improving much at all.  They are sore, fatigued, and tingly.  My theory is pinched nerves in my hips (the previous cause of the tingling) but just much worse.  To combat this, I’m going to pretty much entirely stop exercising for at least a couple days.  If that doesn’t help, it might be something worse or might need a more aggressive treatment.
5/30/20, 8:39 AM - Alex Starr: I can still do upper body/abs stuff, but walking for example is off limits
5/30/20, 8:40 AM - Alex Starr: I’m hoping that the end to exercising won’t significantly affect my mental state, especially considering how down/anxious I’ve been feeling.
5/30/20, 8:45 AM - Vaughn: Oh man thanks for the update and please keep em coming. Hoping for the best for ya man 💚
5/30/20, 9:02 AM - Jason Greenberg: Ah jeez I know how much you love to walk
5/30/20, 9:02 AM - Jason Greenberg: Hopefully a few days off won’t be too bad
5/30/20, 9:16 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah I hope so
5/30/20, 9:38 AM - Matt Casali: Thanks for keeping us updated Alex! I hope that this works out and I'm glad that you're feeling at least a little better
5/30/20, 9:47 AM - Alex Starr: Thanks!  I wouldn’t say feeling better, but we are at least slowly ruling out serious stuff.  For example, my heart is fine.
5/30/20, 2:33 PM - Tim Ko: ❤️ show us all the stuff that u will make!!!
5/30/20, 2:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: Who’s tryna have a distanced herd hangout this week?
5/30/20, 2:48 PM - Matt Casali: Me!
5/30/20, 2:49 PM - Vaughn: Id find my way to mv for that!!
5/30/20, 2:50 PM - Ricky: Yes let’s do this!
5/30/20, 2:51 PM - Parker: i’ll be back next week!
5/30/20, 2:56 PM - Vaughn: <Media omitted>
5/30/20, 2:56 PM - Matt Casali: Curly! What??
5/30/20, 2:57 PM - Vaughn: <Media omitted>
5/30/20, 2:57 PM - Matt Casali: Hahaha no wayyy
5/30/20, 2:57 PM - Ricky: Haha whaaaaat
5/30/20, 2:58 PM - Vaughn: Big moves!!! I think it looks awesome
5/30/20, 2:59 PM - Matt Casali: It does!
5/30/20, 3:01 PM - Tim Ko: Woahhhh
5/30/20, 3:08 PM - Parker: I like it!
5/30/20, 3:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: Wow new shaun
5/30/20, 3:37 PM - Ricky: It’s dope!
5/30/20, 3:38 PM - Ricky: E-boy status
5/31/20, 2:04 PM - Vaughn: Shits getting pretty crazy in the world right now. All this has had an emotional toll on a couple of my housemates. I thought I'd open up a dialogue here in case any of us need to clear their headspace by sharing their thoughts or let off some steam
5/31/20, 2:13 PM - Jason Greenberg: Did something happen with your housemates?
5/31/20, 2:13 PM - Jason Greenberg: You got me curious
5/31/20, 2:17 PM - Vaughn: Oh theyre just extremely activistic and having to keep up with everything and educating everyone through instagram stories has been stressfull for them
5/31/20, 2:27 PM - Alex Starr: I haven’t been keeping track much other than shit seems to be going south.
5/31/20, 2:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Alrighty then
5/31/20, 3:01 PM - Ricky: Deff a horrible time for a lot of minorities in America rn
5/31/20, 3:10 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah did u guys hear about the cnn reporter who got arrested for covering the protest
5/31/20, 3:11 PM - Vaughn: Whoa whyd they get arrested?
5/31/20, 3:14 PM - Tim Ko: Was a black Hispanic reporter and they just arrested him even after he provided all his credentials and was willing to move out of the way to wherever the police wanted him
5/31/20, 3:14 PM - Tim Ko: Arrested his camera crew too
5/31/20, 3:14 PM - Tim Ko: But they released them all after an hour
5/31/20, 3:16 PM - Matt Casali: Crazy stuff
5/31/20, 3:16 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah I heard about that
5/31/20, 3:16 PM - Alex Starr: Seeing the footage of the aftermath of the riots is crazy
5/31/20, 3:17 PM - Alex Starr: Minnesota looks like Detroit
5/31/20, 3:19 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah I think this situation for me has got me thinking of what it means for me to be an Asian American and how we perpetuate this injustice by conforming to the model minority stereotype. All my life I’ve honestly kinda embraced it, and even at times been proud of it. Like when ppl have stereotypes me as being good at math or studying or whatever part of me feels proud that we are thought of smart and hard working. But I can see now how embracing that feeds into the same american racism that greatly hurts the black and brown community.
5/31/20, 3:19 PM - Matt Casali: ❤
5/31/20, 3:20 PM - Matt Casali: I'm sorry tim, that sounds difficult to handle
5/31/20, 3:20 PM - Matt Casali: Thanks for sharing though!
5/31/20, 3:23 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah for sure!
5/31/20, 3:24 PM - Darren: Tim you are maybe the most stereotypical Asian American
5/31/20, 3:24 PM - Vaughn: ^
5/31/20, 3:24 PM - Darren: Like, ever
5/31/20, 3:24 PM - Vaughn: ^
5/31/20, 3:24 PM - Parker: ❤️❤️
5/31/20, 3:25 PM - Tim Ko: I’m just wondering why it took until now for it to get so much attention, since there have been so many instances of racism like this recently
5/31/20, 3:25 PM - Parker: it’s mostly just all pretty depressing
5/31/20, 3:25 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah ik lol, that’s why I’ve been thinking a lot about this
5/31/20, 3:26 PM - Alex Starr: Tim you should pivot, buy a motorcycle, and become a failed actor/mildly successful waiter
5/31/20, 3:26 PM - Parker: Not sure but as far as the video evidence/actual incident, i’d say this was one of the most merciless killings
5/31/20, 3:26 PM - Parker: not to downplay all the others at all
5/31/20, 3:27 PM - Parker: like the dude was on the ground for 9 mins straight, not resisting arrest, begging for his life, and the cop just had his hands in his pockets and showed no mercy
5/31/20, 3:28 PM - Tim Ko: I think this is not neccisarily a call for Asians to completely change who they are but more of a call to stop, for a lack of a better term, “kissing up” to white america
5/31/20, 3:28 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah that’s true, the video was super clear for this one
5/31/20, 3:28 PM - Parker: Who woulda known corona would blow a 3-1 lead to racism
5/31/20, 3:29 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah I’m struggling how to phrase “guys stop protesting we have very immediate very large fish to fry” without sounding insensitive or worse
5/31/20, 3:30 PM - Matt Casali: Gdi haha
5/31/20, 3:31 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
5/31/20, 3:32 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah, though if they stop protesting this is all gonna blow over and nothing will change
5/31/20, 3:34 PM - Matt Casali: True
5/31/20, 3:36 PM - Alex Starr: Which is true every time it happens
5/31/20, 3:38 PM - Darren: I saw a tweet about how the Santa Cruz police chief joined the BLM protest in downtown by taking a knee with the protestors. The sentiment seemed to be "see this is what cops should be doing, not dawning paramilitary gear to fight us".

Of course, one of the top replies was about the graduate student protests and how the police chief apparently beat up some protestors there so...
5/31/20, 3:40 PM - Alex Starr: Given the virus, it doesn’t seem like anything will get done now
5/31/20, 3:49 PM - Alex Starr: Which is really unfortunate
5/31/20, 3:51 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah but idk how much policy can fix this. It’s more of a mindset and values thing
5/31/20, 3:57 PM - Alex Starr: Regardless of the level at which change needs to occur, the virus seems like a serious impediment
5/31/20, 3:59 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah that’s true
5/31/20, 11:28 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
5/31/20, 11:28 PM - Matt Casali: collin i heard you were into techno
5/31/20, 11:31 PM - Matt Casali: I made this by taking a clip of me saying 'hello my name is matthew', detecting frequencies for different time frames, making a new clip with a dominant frequency from those times with the same shaped fourier transform of a clip of me saying 'hello', then stringing it all together.
5/31/20, 11:31 PM - Matt Casali: one of the weirder things that I've created I think
6/1/20, 12:20 AM - Darren: You must be done with your thesis, then
6/1/20, 12:26 AM - Matt Casali: Haha yeah I turned it in on friday
6/1/20, 12:26 AM - Matt Casali: Had to give enough time for edits
6/1/20, 1:15 AM - Tim Ko: Should be Collin and donyas wedding song

6/1/20, 5:34 PM - Parker: Lol
6/1/20, 5:44 PM - Tim Ko: Haha the 25 person limit basically disqualifies most religious gatherings
6/1/20, 5:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: Do you think people will do the services in different shifts thing?
6/1/20, 5:45 PM - Tim Ko: No I don’t think they’ll do it at all lol
6/1/20, 5:45 PM - Tim Ko: Maybe if u have 50 ppl they could have multiple service
6/1/20, 5:46 PM - Tim Ko: But most gatherings are hundreds at least
6/1/20, 5:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah you would think most people wouldn't be into it
6/1/20, 5:47 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah the point of those gatherings is for everyone to be together
6/1/20, 5:47 PM - Tim Ko: Wait so is that like the new guideline for California or something?
6/1/20, 7:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: yeah new guidelines
6/1/20, 7:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: for the county

6/2/20, 2:05 PM - Vaughn: Specific to you!
6/2/20, 2:06 PM - Vaughn: Things youd expect most of us to maybe know

6/2/20, 3:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: Vaughn I fixed my dumb questions where the answer to each one was my name
6/2/20, 3:26 PM - Ricky: Hahahaah
6/2/20, 3:26 PM - Ricky: Category: Jason, every answer, who is Jason?
6/2/20, 3:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: I thought the categories would be like, "Harry Potter" or whatever some other crap than just our name!!!
6/2/20, 3:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: ahahaha
6/2/20, 3:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ok to be fair Harry Potter is just a name but you know what I mean

6/2/20, 7:41 PM - Tim Ko: Gang
6/2/20, 7:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: Is 8 too early?
6/2/20, 7:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: We could push back
6/2/20, 7:45 PM - Alex Starr: Do you want to do 8 for a particular reason?
6/2/20, 7:45 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz I can make that work
6/2/20, 7:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: Well mostly I thought we'd get to hang out with you longer
6/2/20, 7:45 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah that’s a solid option

6/2/20, 8:09 PM - Alex Starr: Zoom has to update

6/2/20, 8:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: this is slow
6/2/20, 9:15 PM - Ricky: <Media omitted>
6/2/20, 9:54 PM - Parker: Oh wait wtf i thought jeopardy was wednesday? :(
6/2/20, 9:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: F
6/2/20, 9:58 PM - Parker: i was taking grad pics and then got food
6/2/20, 9:58 PM - Parker: big Fs
6/2/20, 9:59 PM - Alex Starr: We used your height question for final jeopardy.  Got me to second place and Jason the win
6/2/20, 10:07 PM - Vaughn: All good we only played 1 round
6/2/20, 10:07 PM - Tim Ko: :(
6/2/20, 10:07 PM - Vaughn: Everyone who played should send me 5 more
6/2/20, 10:08 PM - Vaughn: And those who havnt sent any yet can suck a wide one
6/2/20, 10:11 PM - Darren: Yessir
6/2/20, 10:19 PM - Collin Hurst: I suck wide ones on the daily
6/2/20, 10:21 PM - Alex Starr: The correct response was “yessir how wide sir”
6/2/20, 11:19 PM - Parker: Haha nice
6/2/20, 11:19 PM - Parker: Like only one round of questions?
6/3/20, 7:15 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah
6/3/20, 1:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: PSA: Don't use Q-Tips or maybe do
6/3/20, 1:29 PM - Darren: That's a weak PSA
6/3/20, 1:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: This morning I pulled a q-tip out of my ear and saw that that the cotton tip was missing. It seemed like it had broken off inside so after googling and Hayley searching with a flashlight we went to urgent care to have it removed, because if it stayed in it would get infected really fuck up my ear. Went to PAMF and it was super empty inside, got seen in 5 minutes. Doctor looks and says it's clear. It's possible the qtip never had the cotton swab and I didn't notice.
6/3/20, 1:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: After this I will not be using qtips because of what could have happened
6/3/20, 1:32 PM - Collin Hurst: Dang
6/3/20, 1:32 PM - Collin Hurst: Good that it’s ok
6/3/20, 1:32 PM - Matt Casali: You're also not supposed to in general I've heard
6/3/20, 1:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah I told the doctor and he said don't put foreign bodies in your ear
6/3/20, 1:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: Never had a problem my whole life until I did
6/3/20, 1:34 PM - Matt Casali: I saw something that said not to put anything smaller than your elbow? Which is like wtf?
6/3/20, 1:35 PM - Jason Greenberg: I think they're going for shock factor with that
6/3/20, 1:35 PM - Jason Greenberg: But if could be a porn quote lol
6/3/20, 1:39 PM - Parker: Jeez lol glad you’re clear
6/3/20, 2:17 PM - Tim Ko: Damn Jason that’s scary
6/3/20, 2:18 PM - Tim Ko: U should sue them lol
6/3/20, 2:18 PM - Vaughn: Hopefully its not so far in there that they could find it
6/3/20, 2:18 PM - Vaughn: And is laying qtip eggs in your brain
6/3/20, 2:22 PM - Jason Greenberg: LOL
6/4/20, 2:18 PM - Vaughn: Guys serious idea
6/4/20, 2:18 PM - Vaughn: We should make a herd+SO chat
6/4/20, 2:19 PM - Matt Casali: But what if we wanna talk shit about our SOs and then accidentally put it in the wrong chat?
6/4/20, 2:20 PM - Alex Starr: Matt stop selling, you and Vaughn have convinced me
6/4/20, 2:20 PM - Vaughn: Herd+4!
6/4/20, 2:21 PM - Vaughn: Cant wait to catch up with donya
6/4/20, 2:24 PM - Matt Casali: Same!
6/4/20, 2:24 PM - Matt Casali: We have to add shayda because she's gonna end up with someone here
6/4/20, 2:24 PM - Collin Hurst: hm
6/4/20, 2:25 PM - Darren: Hm
6/4/20, 2:26 PM - Alex Starr: A hm of approval?
6/4/20, 2:27 PM - Darren: No
6/4/20, 2:28 PM - Vaughn: That would be a power move
6/4/20, 2:28 PM - Vaughn: Shed see the participants and immediately know whats up
6/4/20, 2:28 PM - Parker: Hahah
6/4/20, 2:29 PM - Vaughn: Does sarafina use whatsapp?
6/4/20, 2:29 PM - Parker: i have no boat in this race so i’m down
6/4/20, 2:29 PM - Alex Starr: I didn’t until Vaughn’s comment and am now firmly against it
6/4/20, 2:30 PM - Parker: Are you implying that sarafina is your boat👀😲
6/4/20, 2:30 PM - Alex Starr: No I’m implying go fuck yourself
6/4/20, 2:31 PM - Alex Starr: But can see where the confusion could have come from
6/4/20, 2:33 PM - Darren: I sense a leak in that boat
6/4/20, 2:34 PM - Alex Starr: Also isn’t it horse in that race?
6/4/20, 2:35 PM - Darren: I sense his horse is taking a leak
6/4/20, 2:37 PM - Alex Starr: Still works
6/4/20, 3:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: I don’t see much of a need for it
6/4/20, 3:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: I won’t stop you tho
6/4/20, 3:11 PM - Darren: Hayley must remain an enigma we see once every 2 years
6/4/20, 3:11 PM - Darren: See/talk to
6/4/20, 3:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hey that’s gonna be your job soon
6/4/20, 3:23 PM - Tim Ko: I think I missed initial meetings with Haley and juj and so I have yet to formally introduced myself but at this point I don’t think it’s nevcisary?
6/4/20, 3:23 PM - Tim Ko: Correct me if I’m wrong @16502079920 @16507995462
6/4/20, 3:24 PM - Tim Ko: *its not neccisary
6/4/20, 3:24 PM - Tim Ko: lmao
6/4/20, 3:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: You weren’t at the New Years party right?
6/4/20, 3:24 PM - Tim Ko: No
6/4/20, 3:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ok yeah I don’t think so. I’ll introduce you guys next chance we’re all in a room
6/4/20, 3:26 PM - Tim Ko: Lol ok 👌
6/4/20, 3:27 PM - Ricky: Haha what does that mean haha
6/4/20, 3:27 PM - Alex Starr: I think it means Darren will be showing up every couple years on a zoom call
6/4/20, 3:30 PM - Darren: Fuck you
6/4/20, 3:30 PM - Darren: And the horse you leaked on
6/4/20, 3:31 PM - Tim Ko: What would be wild if we did herd + parents
6/4/20, 3:32 PM - Tim Ko: We could ask Barry about his best high
6/4/20, 3:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: Just not Barry
6/4/20, 3:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: Never meet your heroes
6/4/20, 3:33 PM - Alex Starr: He’s never done drugs
6/4/20, 3:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: Everyone has done drugs
6/4/20, 3:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: Even Obama
6/4/20, 3:34 PM - Darren: Thanks key and peele
6/4/20, 3:35 PM - Collin Hurst: thats what my dad used to tell me too
6/4/20, 3:35 PM - Alex Starr: No he’s pretty insistent on it
6/4/20, 3:36 PM - Darren: My dad always told me about his peyote days
6/4/20, 3:36 PM - Parker: My mom told me she did acid once in australia
6/4/20, 3:36 PM - Parker: idk about my dad though
6/4/20, 3:37 PM - Parker: Boats race too
6/4/20, 3:37 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah I’d just never heard that before
6/4/20, 3:38 PM - Parker: It’s definitely horse haha boat just popped into my head first
6/4/20, 3:42 PM - Ricky: My mom is in the same boat, can’t say the same about my dad though
6/4/20, 3:46 PM - Tim Ko: Same with my parents and I believe them lol
6/5/20, 1:39 AM - Tim Ko: https://deadline.com/2020/06/los-angeles-mayor-eric-garcetti-city-officials-cutting-100-150-million-from-lapd-budget-funds-to-be-reinvested-in-communities-of-color-1202950811/
6/5/20, 1:40 AM - Tim Ko: Seems like the protests are getting at least something done
6/5/20, 1:40 AM - Collin Hurst: eyy
6/5/20, 1:40 AM - Collin Hurst: now lets see the other states hop on
6/5/20, 1:40 AM - Darren: Holy shit the LAPD had a 1.8 billion dollar annual budget
6/5/20, 1:40 AM - Darren: That's insane
6/5/20, 1:41 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah I’d like to see some big southern cities do that, would be huge
6/5/20, 1:41 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah ikr
6/5/20, 1:41 AM - Tim Ko: Apparently it made up like over 50% of the city budget or something
6/5/20, 1:42 AM - Collin Hurst: it'd be nice to allocate some of the 150 BILLION dollars billionaires have made too maybe that's just me though
6/5/20, 1:42 AM - Collin Hurst: made during corona*
6/5/20, 1:42 AM - Tim Ko: 50% of general funds actually
6/5/20, 1:44 AM - Darren: I mean, sure. But probably expand the outrage to be anyone in the upper-middle and upper  classes, not just the top of the top
6/5/20, 1:47 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah, I’m sure most of the ppl here in tech have not been financially affected one bit
6/5/20, 1:48 AM - Tim Ko: In fact, in my moms case she got extra money to recreate her office environment at home (monitor, chair, standing desk, etc)
6/5/20, 1:52 AM - Darren: To be fair, the population of engineers who make a lot of money but have started recently and don't have that much stored up was probably hit pretty hard (although not as much as other people, relatively speaking)
6/5/20, 1:54 AM - Darren: Also, if getting money from your work to build a home office is actually a big deal to you, you're either not in the "holy shit you have too much money and capitalism is failing" category or you're Asian and tacaño
6/5/20, 1:54 AM - Matt Casali: That's awesome!
6/5/20, 2:11 AM - Tim Ko: I’m everything u described there
6/5/20, 2:12 AM - Tim Ko: I get excited about the free shoes my mom’s work allows us to get every year
6/5/20, 2:20 AM - Parker: Lmao
6/5/20, 7:28 AM - Alex Starr: As a health update, we think we’ve determined the cause of my chest pain.  https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/costochondritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20371175
6/5/20, 7:28 AM - Alex Starr: Good news is it almost certainly isn’t serious, bad news is it feels like I’m having a heart attack when I cough.
6/5/20, 7:41 AM - Jason Greenberg: Oh wow
6/5/20, 7:42 AM - Jason Greenberg: That’s a relief
6/5/20, 7:43 AM - Jason Greenberg: Are you gonna do stuff for the pain?
6/5/20, 7:43 AM - Jason Greenberg: Not a joke I wonder if topical CBD cream would help with the imflammation
6/5/20, 7:43 AM - Ricky: ^is there anything you know of that can help?
6/5/20, 7:43 AM - Ricky: Glad nothings going too wrong though :)
6/5/20, 7:46 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah I’m gonna get back on Advil
6/5/20, 7:51 AM - Alex Starr: And heating pad it
6/5/20, 11:52 AM - Parker: Im glad it’s nothing super serious!
6/5/20, 11:52 AM - Parker: ^
6/5/20, 11:55 AM - Tim Ko: Yay! Good to hear that it’s nothing too serious!

6/5/20, 9:01 PM - Tim Ko: Damn
6/5/20, 9:10 PM - Alex Starr: Did a study for 4 of them
6/5/20, 9:30 PM - Ricky: Damn, that’s sick
6/5/20, 9:30 PM - Ricky: U gon become the hulk wit all dat radiation
6/5/20, 9:31 PM - Ricky: Jkjk ily hope everything goes well
6/5/20, 9:50 PM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
6/5/20, 9:51 PM - Darren: I feel like reopening schedules should take a 2 week pause just to let the next wave catch up before we open anything more
6/5/20, 9:59 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah theres already a bit of an increase from opening up before and I thought that it would slow it down in CA, but yeah I hope they reevaluate
6/6/20, 3:55 PM - Parker: I just cleared enough room on my ps4 for the Warzone update so i can run with you guys now sometime gang gang
6/6/20, 3:55 PM - Parker: im straight garbage but still down lol

6/6/20, 4:02 PM - Tim Ko: Every night I text Collin and Vaughn if they wanna play Warzone with me
6/6/20, 4:03 PM - Tim Ko: Some nights I get rejected, and some nights I get ghosted, but the nights when they say yes are so exciting for me
6/6/20, 4:03 PM - Parker: Lmao
6/6/20, 4:08 PM - Alex Starr: Tim you need to make that your LinkedIn profile description or something
6/6/20, 4:10 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
6/6/20, 4:10 PM - Tim Ko: Alex I sent u a request to connect
6/6/20, 5:47 PM - Jason Greenberg: <Media omitted>
6/6/20, 5:50 PM - Alex Starr: How long did it take? How do you feel having consumed the body of George Floyd? Were you shocked that Detroit didn’t just eat itself?
6/6/20, 5:51 PM - Parker: Ayyyy
6/6/20, 5:51 PM - Parker: lol
6/6/20, 5:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lol
6/6/20, 5:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ngl it I’ve been at it for days and I’ve learned a lot ahaha
6/6/20, 5:55 PM - Alex Starr: What strategy propelled you to the top?
6/6/20, 6:02 PM - Parker: there are lots of dark jokes there
6/6/20, 6:02 PM - Parker: considering who got 2nd
6/6/20, 6:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: 1) At spawn split as soon as your mass allows, for speed and better collection. Immediately begin searching for a red virus, as you'll need it soon. If you divide the map into 3rds on the x and y axes, red viruses seem to spawn most often on these dividing lines, so hunt here. 2) Eat a green virus as soon as your size allows but be careful of nearby players 3) Next eat a red virus. 4) Next eat any nearby virus, red is preferable. When you mass explodes this time, use the largest part of your mass to continue eating nearby viruses. For a short window, your mass won't explode all over the place but just gets bigger when you eat a virus. 5) After the second boundary shrinking, avoid eating viruses and go after players. Making allies with W in tight spots can be the difference between 1st and 2nd place.
6/6/20, 6:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh shit I just saw George Floyd on there jeez
6/6/20, 6:16 PM - Ricky: Damn go you, I honestly didn’t even know a battle royal version existed haha

6/6/20, 7:24 PM - Vaughn: Does exploding from the greens count as eating?
6/6/20, 7:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah you gain mass but get split up
6/6/20, 7:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: When you reconsolidate you’re bigger
6/6/20, 7:52 PM - Ricky: Oh shit! I did not know that at all
6/6/20, 10:18 PM - Vaughn: <Media omitted>

6/10/20, 9:17 PM - Matt Casali: Disc golf
6/10/20, 9:31 PM - Collin Hurst: Well the closest you get to people is if there’s a back up at the tee
6/10/20, 9:31 PM - Collin Hurst: Then you just stand behind them like 10 feet at least
6/10/20, 9:31 PM - Collin Hurst: Safer than most things you can do rn
6/10/20, 9:33 PM - Ricky: Oooooh that sounds fun to me!
6/10/20, 9:48 PM - Alex Starr: Hard to distance from others in your party tho
6/10/20, 9:48 PM - Collin Hurst: Eh not really
6/10/20, 9:48 PM - Collin Hurst: People take turns putting anyways
6/10/20, 9:49 PM - Collin Hurst: It’s so much safer than going into any store
6/10/20, 9:50 PM - Alex Starr: True probably
6/10/20, 9:51 PM - Tim Ko: I might be interested
6/10/20, 9:51 PM - Tim Ko: Idk if my parents would let me tho
6/10/20, 9:51 PM - Tim Ko: So far my parents have been ok with me going anywhere that’s biking distance
6/10/20, 9:55 PM - Ricky: It’s technically in biking distance

6/10/20, 10:01 PM - Matt Casali: Biking is prob worse haha
6/10/20, 10:02 PM - Matt Casali: Especially if we're riding close together
6/10/20, 10:02 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah, my parents just don’t want me venturing too far out there

6/11/20, 10:03 AM - Matt Casali: There was a very very low chance it was going to be one of my friends
6/11/20, 10:10 AM - Darren: I feel like matt would hate someone named Emerson until he got drunk with him once and then realized "wow Emerson is actually a pretty cool guy"
6/11/20, 10:13 AM - Alex Starr: Girl I think
6/11/20, 10:13 AM - Alex Starr: But yes
6/11/20, 10:14 AM - Matt Casali: Or maybe me getting drunk would make me hate them more
6/11/20, 3:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ahaha true
6/11/20, 11:05 PM - Ricky: Just to clarify, we meeting Cuesta tomorrow?
6/11/20, 11:05 PM - Matt Casali: Yeee

6/12/20, 8:26 AM - Alex Starr: Ur up tho
6/12/20, 8:30 AM - Parker: We don’t have to do it if the majority can’t
6/12/20, 8:30 AM - Parker: but if it’s a problem of waking up...
6/12/20, 8:30 AM - Collin Hurst: I may not be sober enough to get back home
6/12/20, 8:33 AM - Alex Starr: As in you won’t be sober by noon?
6/12/20, 8:34 AM - Collin Hurst: Yeah maybe not enough to drive

6/12/20, 8:41 AM - Collin Hurst: Yeah
6/12/20, 10:03 AM - Jason Greenberg: I most likely won’t be able to make it until 1
6/12/20, 10:03 AM - Jason Greenberg: I’ll let y’all know if that changes
6/12/20, 10:04 AM - Matt Casali: Should we just do 4 then?
6/12/20, 10:05 AM - Jason Greenberg: I can’t make 4 at all
6/12/20, 10:05 AM - Ricky: idk about you guys, but that will greatly decrease the amount of time i can see yall
6/12/20, 10:05 AM - Matt Casali: Oh then 1 it is

6/12/20, 1:06 PM - Alex Starr: I’ll be there in 10.
6/12/20, 1:20 PM - Alex Starr: Alright I’ve been walking around for 5 minutes where r u guys
6/12/20, 1:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’m here
6/12/20, 1:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: Parking lot
6/12/20, 3:29 PM - Alex Starr: Parker it sucks I missed you but we should hang out this week maybe Tuesday
6/12/20, 3:29 PM - Alex Starr: Could do a bring your own glass thing so you can show off your mixology ability
6/12/20, 3:30 PM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
6/12/20, 3:30 PM - Matt Casali: Yes pleasw
6/12/20, 3:30 PM - Alex Starr: Also we should probably all be wearing masks for these things/be a little further apart
6/12/20, 3:30 PM - Parker: i know im sad i just barely missed you
6/12/20, 3:31 PM - Parker: Yes!!! rick and i were saying we should do a socially distanced get drunk together since we’re all done now and that deserves a celebration
6/12/20, 3:31 PM - Parker: and yeah if i could make drinks that’d be sweet haha
6/12/20, 3:31 PM - Alex Starr: I was also contemplating distanced edibles
6/12/20, 3:32 PM - Alex Starr: Tough to pass a pipe around, easy to pass edibles
6/12/20, 3:32 PM - Parker: Yeah just a general get zooted together session to celebrate
6/12/20, 3:32 PM - Parker: True
6/12/20, 3:32 PM - Parker: i can bring my bong and we can disinfect it after every hit
6/12/20, 3:32 PM - Alex Starr: Finally up the dose so I feel something
6/12/20, 3:32 PM - Alex Starr: More than just have a really hard time peeing and feel kinda lightheaded haha
6/12/20, 3:33 PM - Parker: I also brought some joints home that might be easier than a bong
6/12/20, 3:33 PM - Parker: and there’s also a way you can smoke them without your mouth touching it
6/12/20, 3:33 PM - Parker: Lol
6/12/20, 3:34 PM - Alex Starr: Also Parker you’re backyard might be a good bet in terms of size and not a public place
6/12/20, 3:38 PM - Parker: true
6/12/20, 3:39 PM - Parker: i’d be down
6/12/20, 3:39 PM - Parker: i also have a little front area that would be perfect for this
6/12/20, 3:39 PM - Darren: Out of context, this is hilarious
6/12/20, 3:40 PM - Alex Starr: Realized it as soon as I said it haha
6/12/20, 3:49 PM - Collin Hurst: So Tuesday? Just need to reserve a day
6/12/20, 4:07 PM - Parker: I’d be down for tuesday
6/12/20, 4:09 PM - Alex Starr: I was thinking Tuesday
6/12/20, 4:09 PM - Alex Starr: It should be fairly early though
6/12/20, 4:14 PM - Parker: what time can you do?
6/12/20, 4:14 PM - Parker: or want to do
6/12/20, 4:22 PM - Alex Starr: Just wanna be able to quit before midnight.  Idk how I’d get home tho.  This needs some thinking
6/12/20, 4:53 PM - Parker: agreed
6/12/20, 4:54 PM - Parker: if people can figure out a way home , y’all are welcome here on tuesday
6/12/20, 4:59 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah ill have to talk with my family to see if they’re comfortable.  If not we can do Cuesta round 3
6/12/20, 5:02 PM - Alex Starr: Which it’s honestly looking more like a Cuesta situation for me.
6/12/20, 5:03 PM - Matt Casali: Edibles at cuesta!
6/12/20, 5:03 PM - Alex Starr: This is a solid option
6/12/20, 5:04 PM - Matt Casali: Same for me but admittedly I have a bias
6/12/20, 5:05 PM - Parker: and we can bring drinks in unsuspecting water bottles
6/12/20, 5:05 PM - Parker: Im down for either way
6/12/20, 5:11 PM - Collin Hurst: Any
6/12/20, 5:32 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah idk about the someone’s house thing.  There weren’t a lot of masks and wasn’t a ton of distancing
6/12/20, 5:56 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah I’d be more comfortable outside
6/12/20, 6:12 PM - Parker: It’d for sure be outside at someone’s house but yeah the park is probably a better option
6/13/20, 7:37 PM - Tim Ko: U guys hear about the man in atlanta?
6/13/20, 7:48 PM - Ricky: What happened?
6/13/20, 7:52 PM - Parker: the guy that got shot?
6/13/20, 7:53 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah
6/13/20, 7:54 PM - Tim Ko: Black man fell asleep drunk in his car at a Wendy’s, police came and tried to arrest him, he took the police’s taser and ran away and fired the taser back at police, then the police shot him
6/14/20, 12:22 PM - Collin Hurst: Why do they always shoot to kill I don’t understand that
6/14/20, 12:24 PM - Alex Starr: Hard to hit limbs
6/14/20, 12:25 PM - Parker: for someone who’s not trained yeah
6/14/20, 12:25 PM - Collin Hurst: Ok but if he’s tazing distance you can hit limbs easily
6/14/20, 12:26 PM - Tim Ko: https://www.quora.com/Are-police-not-trained-to-shoot-in-the-leg-Why-do-they-always-go-for-the-kill
6/14/20, 12:26 PM - Tim Ko: I was curious too and found an answer on quora
6/14/20, 12:27 PM - Collin Hurst: well I get that for life or death situations
6/14/20, 12:27 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah they definitely shouldn’t have been shooting in the first place
6/14/20, 12:27 PM - Matt Casali: Well it does seem like life or death for them when a black man feels like a threat
6/14/20, 12:27 PM - Collin Hurst: But that doesn’t explain when they kill someone who’s running away
6/14/20, 12:27 PM - Tim Ko: And they shouldn’t have tried to arrest him
6/14/20, 12:29 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah but the thing is he clearly was super drunk and didn’t have a lethal weapon
6/14/20, 12:29 PM - Matt Casali: Well then it was a much more conscious racism?
6/14/20, 12:30 PM - Parker: those answers just all tried to justify it being only in life or death situations but most of these haven’t been
6/14/20, 12:30 PM - Parker: ^
6/14/20, 12:31 PM - Parker: exactly, so they see encountering a black man as a life or death situation
6/14/20, 12:31 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah I’m starting to think it’s just the police wanting to show their superiority
6/14/20, 12:31 PM - Tim Ko: Idk
6/14/20, 12:32 PM - Tim Ko: Don’t think it’s as simple as that
6/14/20, 12:33 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah exactly, Using a lethal weapon should only be in life and death situation
6/14/20, 12:34 PM - Parker: no one here is disagreeing haha
6/14/20, 12:34 PM - Parker: a lot of these incidents haven’t been though
6/14/20, 12:35 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah totally agree
6/14/20, 12:35 PM - Tim Ko: I looked up why don’t they use tranquilizers like they do for animals
6/14/20, 12:36 PM - Tim Ko: And it’s a baaaaad idea to do so lol
6/14/20, 12:36 PM - Tim Ko: https://www.quora.com/Why-don-t-law-enforcement-officers-use-tranquilizer-guns-when-they-re-shooting-someone-as-a-way-to-control-the-situation-without-definite-consequences
6/14/20, 12:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: I guess another tough element is that the man took his non lethal weapon
6/14/20, 12:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: Bc I def think it wasn’t a situation that required lethal force
6/14/20, 12:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: Maybe cops need multiple options for ranged non lethal weapons
6/15/20, 12:17 PM - Ricky: Where t f is the white fish tubes for imitation crab at Nikita?
6/15/20, 12:17 PM - Ricky: Nijiya*
6/15/20, 12:22 PM - Vaughn: Askin the real questions
6/15/20, 12:23 PM - Vaughn: Back right wall last time I went
6/15/20, 12:34 PM - Alex Starr: I couldn’t find it at nijiya and had to go to Safeway
6/15/20, 12:34 PM - Ricky: Found it
6/15/20, 12:35 PM - Ricky: Was next to the tofu
6/15/20, 12:35 PM - Alex Starr: Ah okay
6/15/20, 12:35 PM - Ricky: Forgot I was looking for “sea sticks”
6/15/20, 12:35 PM - Alex Starr: Didn’t look there
6/15/20, 12:35 PM - Alex Starr: Lol
6/15/20, 12:35 PM - Alex Starr: It’s like fish sticks
6/15/20, 12:35 PM - Alex Starr: Didn’t have a follow up to that one unfortunately
6/15/20, 12:35 PM - Jason Greenberg: Loll
6/15/20, 12:36 PM - Ricky: Haha yeah, just funny
6/15/20, 12:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: Something something bukake

6/16/20, 10:54 AM - Jason Greenberg: We could try to get jeopardy going
6/16/20, 10:55 AM - Ricky: We will need mr. Vaughn Trebek for that one
6/16/20, 10:56 AM - Ricky: Not because we can’t make it without him, but because I refuse to trust anyone but him with the power to make seemingly random gamechanging point adjustments
6/16/20, 11:21 AM - Alex Starr: There has to be a way to do CAH
6/16/20, 11:45 AM - Darren: Have we looked at https://www.azala.info/static/index.html?
6/16/20, 11:45 AM - Darren: it appears to do CAH with custom decksk
6/16/20, 11:47 AM - Darren: Whether it's good or not is a different question
6/16/20, 12:04 PM - Parker: yeah there has to be platforms out there
6/16/20, 12:05 PM - Parker: i know Hanna played it with her friends i can ask what she used

6/16/20, 2:15 PM - Tim Ko: Hahaha

6/16/20, 2:33 PM - Tim Ko: I just thought of a funny one
6/16/20, 2:33 PM - Tim Ko: “This girl politely told Parker she wanted to go to prom without a date but ended up taking a bag of nuts from another guy and going as his date”
6/16/20, 2:34 PM - Alex Starr: Idk that one
6/16/20, 2:34 PM - Ricky: Is that big S?
6/16/20, 2:34 PM - Tim Ko: Yes indeed hahaha
6/16/20, 2:34 PM - Ricky: Going with skinny S
6/16/20, 2:34 PM - Alex Starr: That was my guess as well but not sure
6/16/20, 2:39 PM - Vaughn: Its unlikely, but if everyone whos free tonight could send me questions for themself thatd be dope
6/16/20, 2:49 PM - Alex Starr: Anyone ever made steamed buns?
6/16/20, 2:50 PM - Alex Starr: If yes, how’d you go about doing the steaming?
6/16/20, 2:52 PM - Tim Ko: Do u have a thing to put in the pot that raises the buns above water?
6/16/20, 2:52 PM - Alex Starr: Yes
6/16/20, 2:53 PM - Tim Ko: Ok, just fill the pot with water, then put the thing, close the lid then boil
6/16/20, 2:53 PM - Tim Ko: Make sure buns isn’t touching water
6/16/20, 2:53 PM - Alex Starr: Oh okay lid completely closed?

6/16/20, 2:53 PM - Alex Starr: You ever tried doing it in an instant pot?
6/16/20, 2:54 PM - Tim Ko: Don’t put fire too hot or pot will start bubbling like crazy
6/16/20, 2:54 PM - Tim Ko: I have not
6/16/20, 2:54 PM - Alex Starr: I won’t then.  Is there a way to do a lot of buns at once?
6/16/20, 2:55 PM - Tim Ko: If there is a way to stack them on top of each other? That’s the only way I know
6/16/20, 2:55 PM - Tim Ko: Other than a bigger pot
6/16/20, 2:55 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah I may try to stack them
6/16/20, 2:55 PM - Tim Ko: Like how u do in an oven
6/16/20, 2:55 PM - Tim Ko: What kinda buns u making?
6/16/20, 2:55 PM - Alex Starr: Or just do them 3 at a time
6/16/20, 2:56 PM - Alex Starr: Just plain ones that look like tacos to fill later
6/16/20, 2:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: lolol

6/16/20, 3:26 PM - Tim Ko: Ricky coulda had both in the movie theatre tbh
6/16/20, 3:27 PM - Darren: I didn't realize this was an option at the time, but it's > BvS for sure

6/16/20, 3:44 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah absolutely a reasonable call
6/16/20, 3:47 PM - Parker: Wait so vaughn you want us to send them in about only us? or can i do 5 questions on different exes
6/16/20, 3:48 PM - Alex Starr: I may not make it tonight, but regardless do the exes one

6/17/20, 11:07 AM - Parker: i feel like one has to be a stretch though
6/17/20, 11:09 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah, I played with another 7’3 paint beast and it was fun just clogging up the paint and throwing up hooks all day haha
6/17/20, 11:10 AM - Tim Ko: It’s more of just fun messing around than trying ur best to win
6/17/20, 11:10 AM - Tim Ko: Next time we play together we should do that
6/17/20, 11:10 AM - Tim Ko: Since ur guys is a glass cleaning , rebound and defense beast right
6/17/20, 11:29 AM - Parker: yeah true, and also if you have 3 competent players it’s not too hard to run people in park most of the time

6/17/20, 12:04 PM - Tim Ko: ^
6/17/20, 12:46 PM - Alex Starr: This was an interesting article about sushi grade fish
6/17/20, 12:46 PM - Alex Starr: https://sushimodern.com/sushi/sushi-grade-myth/
6/17/20, 12:49 PM - Alex Starr: TLDR only certain fish often have parasites, and even with parasites it probably won’t get you
6/17/20, 12:55 PM - Darren: Interesting
6/17/20, 12:55 PM - Matt Casali: Cheap sushi time
6/17/20, 12:56 PM - Darren: Shame that salmon is one of the types of fish they say to use an alternate for
6/17/20, 12:56 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah
6/17/20, 12:56 PM - Alex Starr: But tuna it seems is totally fine
6/17/20, 12:56 PM - Alex Starr: Other issue is that Safeway doesn’t carry all that much fish that’s commonly used in sushi
6/17/20, 12:58 PM - Darren: True
6/17/20, 12:59 PM - Alex Starr: Farmed salmon though is very low risk
6/17/20, 12:59 PM - Alex Starr: https://sushimodern.com/sushi/safe-sushi-grade-species/
6/17/20, 12:59 PM - Darren: Would be interesting to buy fish in half Moon Bay or similar and then make an ass ton of sushi
6/17/20, 12:59 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah get it extremely fresh
6/17/20, 1:00 PM - Tim Ko: Interesting
6/17/20, 1:00 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah 90% of my raw fish consumption is tuna from Costco
6/17/20, 1:00 PM - Tim Ko: And haven’t had any problems yet
6/17/20, 1:00 PM - Alex Starr: What to you eat it in?
6/17/20, 1:00 PM - Alex Starr: Do*
6/17/20, 1:01 PM - Tim Ko: Just seer the outside and leave the inside raw
6/17/20, 1:01 PM - Tim Ko: Eat with doc
6/17/20, 1:01 PM - Tim Ko: Rice
6/17/20, 1:01 PM - Tim Ko: Also Costco has tuna poke
6/17/20, 1:01 PM - Alex Starr: Just checking
6/17/20, 1:01 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah true
6/17/20, 1:01 PM - Alex Starr: Might be making a Safeway run this weekend
6/17/20, 1:02 PM - Alex Starr: Might as well use my parents meal funding for the last couple months I have it haha
6/17/20, 1:02 PM - Tim Ko: Haha tru
6/17/20, 1:04 PM - Alex Starr: This is the real key.  Raw salmon is so good.  It also just seemed better quality than the maguro we bought
6/17/20, 1:07 PM - Collin Hurst: Trader Joe’s Norwegian farmed baby
6/17/20, 1:07 PM - Collin Hurst: Shit is bomb
6/17/20, 1:07 PM - Alex Starr: Eh wild is better imo
6/17/20, 1:08 PM - Alex Starr: Plus way better for the environment
6/17/20, 1:09 PM - Tim Ko: The salmon nigiri we had in LA was the best I’ve ever had I think
6/17/20, 1:16 PM - Alex Starr: Ya it was randomly super good
6/17/20, 1:16 PM - Alex Starr: Sucks we won’t be able to do kenzo forever
6/17/20, 1:38 PM - Tim Ko: :((
6/17/20, 1:38 PM - Tim Ko: Next summer!
6/17/20, 1:47 PM - Darren: Maguro is famously mislabeled super frequently because the food dying process can hide the type of fish it actually is
6/17/20, 2:07 PM - Alex Starr: That makes sense.
6/17/20, 2:07 PM - Alex Starr: Whereas salmon is hard to fake
6/17/20, 2:07 PM - Alex Starr: But red dye handles tuna
6/17/20, 2:17 PM - Parker: I’ve been wanting to try this
6/17/20, 2:17 PM - Parker: so fire
6/17/20, 2:41 PM - Collin Hurst: With place and white sesame seed crust
6/17/20, 2:42 PM - Collin Hurst: Black*
6/17/20, 3:08 PM - Parker: Nüt
6/17/20, 3:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: Wow did not know this and it’s a game changer
6/17/20, 3:40 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah tho I still think it has to be quality to taste good
6/17/20, 3:57 PM - Tim Ko: Yeee Costco is the plug
6/17/20, 3:57 PM - Tim Ko: Can get a huge piece for a good price and usually very fresh
6/17/20, 3:59 PM - Alex Starr: I’m not so sure about quality haha
6/17/20, 4:15 PM - Tim Ko: Costco usually has decent quality
6/17/20, 4:15 PM - Tim Ko: It’s not the high end stuff
6/17/20, 4:15 PM - Tim Ko: But at least u won’t get old or spoil stuff
6/17/20, 4:15 PM - Tim Ko: I’ve definitely seen those at Safeway and nob hill
6/17/20, 4:16 PM - Tim Ko: Especially when the raw fish is discounted at half price
6/17/20, 4:20 PM - Collin Hurst: Trader Joe’s Norwegian farm raised
6/17/20, 4:20 PM - Collin Hurst: Trader Joe’s Norwegian farm raised
6/17/20, 6:04 PM - Ricky: <Media omitted>

6/24/20, 12:46 PM - Darren: That would certainly give Matt's car time to charge
6/24/20, 12:46 PM - Alex Starr: The extended edition all 3 movies comes in at around 12 hours
6/24/20, 12:47 PM - Tim Ko: Damn that’s like 4 hrs per movie

7/2/20, 12:14 AM - Darren: Hate to see it
7/2/20, 12:17 AM - Darren: (for context, Captainzack was also the kid who had a relationship with Ally and got him kicked out of smash)
7/2/20, 1:07 AM - Collin Hurst: Damn
7/2/20, 1:15 AM - Darren: Nairo also paid Zack over 2 grand via an anonymous paypal to stay quiet and lie about it...

The psychologist then diagnosed him with delusions because in an interview with her he described his parents as telling him that he needed to be competitive with white boys his age.

7/3/20, 9:31 AM - Alex Starr: Also it’s interesting to see the graph of cases in the EU and the US.  The EU one is a hump and the US is just shooting up

7/8/20, 4:55 PM - Alex Starr: Nah
7/8/20, 4:55 PM - Matt Casali: It needs at least 2 votes to be let in
7/8/20, 4:55 PM - Alex Starr: I like the absolutely arbitrary and undemocratic current version
7/8/20, 4:55 PM - Matt Casali: I would have liked to see my cards yesterday

7/8/20, 5:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: It was tough to narrow them down
7/8/20, 5:22 PM - Matt Casali: I still think a more democratic approach would be nice
7/8/20, 5:23 PM - Matt Casali: Although it would take the surprise factor out of it
7/8/20, 5:23 PM - Matt Casali: Or we just add all of them
7/8/20, 5:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: Network TV is democratic
7/8/20, 5:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: democracy makes creativity harder
7/8/20, 5:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: bc you try to please everyone
7/8/20, 5:23 PM - Matt Casali: ^
7/8/20, 5:24 PM - Matt Casali: Creativity flourishes with constraints
7/8/20, 5:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: I'm fine with that
7/8/20, 5:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: The delete card function on azala works pretty well in game
7/8/20, 5:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: We can just dump them all in no filter
7/8/20, 5:29 PM - Matt Casali: Yee
7/8/20, 5:38 PM - Tim Ko: Ayyy u back on fb alex??
7/8/20, 5:38 PM - Tim Ko: Gang gang
7/8/20, 5:38 PM - Tim Ko: I suggest maybe changing ur number so it’s not public to see for everyone haha
7/8/20, 5:38 PM - Alex Starr: Probably a good move
7/8/20, 5:38 PM - Tim Ko: *like make it private
7/8/20, 5:40 PM - Alex Starr: It’s just friends I think but I made it private
7/8/20, 5:48 PM - Darren: What's the Stanford thing?
7/8/20, 5:54 PM - Alex Starr: Group for biosciences first years
7/8/20, 5:57 PM - Alex Starr: I’m not sure I’m a fan of the write in or delete options.  Makes for fewer creative combos I think
7/8/20, 5:59 PM - Matt Casali: Write in I dont like but delete is good
7/8/20, 6:12 PM - Alex Starr: We got pretty quickly to repeats due to delete
7/8/20, 6:13 PM - Matt Casali: Well we just need more then
7/8/20, 6:53 PM - Alex Starr: That is one solution
7/8/20, 8:58 PM - Parker: And deleting less of the originals will help with not getting repeats haha
7/8/20, 8:58 PM - Parker: I think that’s the move
7/9/20, 10:08 AM - Alex Starr: The economist gave Biden an 8 in 9 chance of winning
7/9/20, 10:09 AM - Matt Casali: It'll be interesting to see a debate
7/9/20, 10:13 AM - Parker: honestly at this rate he shouldn’t debate and just let trump continue to lose it lol
7/9/20, 10:18 AM - Matt Casali: I know haha
7/9/20, 10:18 AM - Matt Casali: That's why they fought against a fourth debate
7/9/20, 3:44 PM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
7/9/20, 3:45 PM - Collin Hurst: The one I caught wasn’t as cool as this, but I knocked off a bucket list item today!!
7/9/20, 3:55 PM - Alex Starr: Nice!
7/9/20, 4:15 PM - Tim Ko: That’s dope
7/9/20, 4:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: V cool
7/9/20, 5:10 PM - Ricky: Anybody heard of a wiesen technical assessment?
7/9/20, 5:11 PM - Collin Hurst: Is it given by the sukma society?
7/9/20, 5:11 PM - Collin Hurst: I feel like maybe
7/9/20, 5:12 PM - Ricky: Sukma dickhole
7/9/20, 5:13 PM - Ricky: It’s for a sales thing at a Japanese company and I was like “sukma” maybe that’s some Japanese thing? You almost got me
7/9/20, 5:13 PM - Collin Hurst: Lol damn it
7/9/20, 5:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: You gonna work with machines?

7/9/20, 6:45 PM - Tim Ko: Sukma what?
7/9/20, 7:26 PM - Alex Starr: Leg went numb again...
7/9/20, 7:38 PM - Parker: Yikes
7/9/20, 7:38 PM - Alex Starr: So looking coin flippy on the hike
7/9/20, 7:58 PM - Ricky: np, i hope its better so you cna come but don't push yourself if you can't
7/9/20, 9:08 PM - Tim Ko: :((
7/9/20, 9:08 PM - Tim Ko: Have u gone to the pain doctor yet?
7/9/20, 9:08 PM - Alex Starr: At least it doesn’t hurt like hell rn haha
7/9/20, 9:08 PM - Alex Starr: Don’t have an appointment yet
7/9/20, 9:11 PM - Tim Ko: Ah for sure
7/9/20, 9:15 PM - Tim Ko: Still numb now?
7/9/20, 9:16 PM - Alex Starr: Little better
7/9/20, 9:16 PM - Alex Starr: I also pretty definitely have carpal tunnel.
7/9/20, 9:18 PM - Tim Ko: Dang, is the tingling in hands a new development?
7/9/20, 9:22 PM - Alex Starr: It’s pain and falling asleep while I’m asleep.  Not super new no but took a while to better confirm
7/9/20, 9:25 PM - Tim Ko: I see
7/9/20, 9:26 PM - Tim Ko: Alright, hope you’ll feel better tomorrow, and don’t push it if ur hurting too much
7/10/20, 11:29 AM - Matt Casali: Does anyone have nintendo online
7/10/20, 11:29 AM - Matt Casali: ?
7/10/20, 11:31 AM - Vaughn: Nope :(
7/10/20, 11:33 AM - Parker: I think Hanna might on our switch
7/10/20, 11:33 AM - Parker: actually im almost positive she does
7/10/20, 12:02 PM - Matt Casali: Get smash! Play with me
7/10/20, 12:05 PM - Parker: she took it back with her so i can’t until im back home
7/10/20, 12:05 PM - Parker: I’d be more down to do animal crossing haha i’m getting into it
7/10/20, 12:05 PM - Parker: just upgraded my house
7/10/20, 12:08 PM - Matt Casali: I was very into it for a little bit, but it got old soo fast haha
7/10/20, 12:08 PM - Matt Casali: Smash will always be there for me
7/10/20, 12:15 PM - Parker: Aw i was the exact opposite haha
7/10/20, 12:16 PM - Parker: Hanna built up our island and i was just getting into it since i’ve been up in seattle
7/10/20, 12:17 PM - Matt Casali: I mean hey I'll definitely play with you all
7/10/20, 12:17 PM - Matt Casali: But my island's probably shit now
7/10/20, 12:39 PM - Tim Ko: We all need to get back on clash of clans
7/10/20, 8:13 PM - Alex Starr: Should we start making more cards?
7/10/20, 8:14 PM - Vaughn: Yes!
7/10/20, 8:15 PM - Alex Starr: I think we need way more if we are going to keep the delete feature
7/10/20, 8:15 PM - Vaughn: I was thinking we could do honor system
7/10/20, 8:15 PM - Vaughn: maximum you can delete 1 per turn
7/10/20, 8:16 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah plus no blanks
7/10/20, 9:38 PM - Parker: down for that
7/10/20, 9:39 PM - Parker: i didn’t even use the blanks haha
7/11/20, 1:05 AM - Tim Ko: I used 2 blanks and got 2 pts from it haha
7/11/20, 5:21 PM - Alex Starr: Random question, what’s everyone’s favorite thing to put in pancakes?
7/11/20, 5:21 PM - Ricky: In or on?
7/11/20, 5:21 PM - Ricky: And is nothing an option
7/11/20, 5:23 PM - Parker: Banana has to be top for me
7/11/20, 5:23 PM - Parker: On top, you know my answer
7/11/20, 5:32 PM - Darren: Chocolate chips the fuck
7/11/20, 5:34 PM - Tim Ko: Fruits like strawberries banana and blueberries
7/11/20, 5:35 PM - Jason Greenberg: I like them plain
7/11/20, 5:35 PM - Jason Greenberg: But chocolate can be good
7/11/20, 5:36 PM - Alex Starr: Now same question no syrup
7/11/20, 5:36 PM - Alex Starr: In
7/11/20, 5:38 PM - Alex Starr: Can be on as long as you don’t say maple syrup
7/11/20, 5:38 PM - Alex Starr: I’m actually against chocolate chips in pancakes, unless there are only a few.
7/11/20, 5:39 PM - Darren: The fuck
7/11/20, 5:39 PM - Alex Starr: I agree tim berries in pancakes (and bananas/pears) are top, but as looking for creative ideas
7/11/20, 5:39 PM - Alex Starr: I like the syrup flavor more
7/11/20, 5:40 PM - Alex Starr: Than chocolate chips I mean
7/11/20, 5:47 PM - Parker: Too many chocolate chips is no bueno but i also like chocolate chips
7/11/20, 5:47 PM - Parker: but with maple syrup it can verge on too sweet
7/11/20, 5:49 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah exactly
7/11/20, 5:53 PM - Ricky: Naw if I have a pancake I think the more chocolate chips the better
7/11/20, 5:53 PM - Ricky: Just make that thing a cookie
7/11/20, 5:54 PM - Ricky: Lmk when we get real and start talking about waffles
7/11/20, 5:55 PM - Alex Starr: We mostly eat pancakes.  Turns out waffles really need sugar (my dad can’t eat sugar)
7/11/20, 5:55 PM - Parker: Facts
7/11/20, 5:55 PM - Parker: banana waffles >>
7/11/20, 5:57 PM - Alex Starr: With nuts
7/11/20, 5:57 PM - Matt Casali: Banana walnut
7/11/20, 5:57 PM - Matt Casali: Cant beat it
7/11/20, 5:58 PM - Alex Starr: Macadamia nut
7/11/20, 5:58 PM - Matt Casali: I'm not a huge fan of chocolate chips in pancakes either
7/11/20, 5:58 PM - Alex Starr: Check mate
7/11/20, 5:58 PM - Parker: disagree
7/11/20, 5:58 PM - Darren: Matt being pro an opinion is almost a negative signal
7/11/20, 5:58 PM - Parker: but i know that’s probably an unpopular opinion
7/11/20, 5:58 PM - Alex Starr: I’m just not huge on banana
7/11/20, 5:58 PM - Parker: i don’t like nuts in things
7/11/20, 5:59 PM - Parker: well that’s your first mistake
7/11/20, 5:59 PM - Alex Starr: Also purely in terms of taste, French toast > waffles > pancakes
7/11/20, 5:59 PM - Alex Starr: It’s growing on me though, especially with nuts or tropical fruit
7/11/20, 6:00 PM - Parker: bananas foster french toast is next level
7/11/20, 6:01 PM - Ricky: Eggs > everything else
7/11/20, 6:02 PM - Darren: Other meals > breakfast
7/11/20, 6:05 PM - Ricky: 100% agree
7/11/20, 6:08 PM - Alex Starr: Breakfast as a dessert, good once in a while
7/12/20, 11:51 AM - Jason Greenberg: Can I say I like the location as one of the reason for "why this school"?
7/12/20, 11:51 AM - Jason Greenberg: @16507145032
7/12/20, 11:53 AM - Jason Greenberg: So far I have 1) areas of emphasis available 2) i match well with several profs and 3) available patient population
7/12/20, 12:04 PM - Alex Starr: What’s the reason location is good?
7/12/20, 12:05 PM - Alex Starr: For example, if it’s job opportunities after then totally.  Weather, not so much.
7/12/20, 12:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: yeah it was more the idiosyncratic preference
7/12/20, 12:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: I could maybe work the job opportunities angle
7/12/20, 12:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: Would you add anything to those 3?
7/12/20, 12:10 PM - Tim Ko: For med school I definitly did that for Bay Area and so cal schools
7/12/20, 12:12 PM - Alex Starr: Also close by family/SO is generally okay I think. I wouldn’t focus on it tho
7/12/20, 12:13 PM - Alex Starr: Prestige maybe? I think also saying what the university would enable you to do.  E.g. PAU has X which will really allow me to pursue Y or open up opportunities in Z
7/12/20, 12:14 PM - Alex Starr: Also altruism angle.  I always said something about how I really want to do research and grad school is the best way to do that.
7/12/20, 12:14 PM - Alex Starr: Sort of immediate benefits of going as well as long term
7/12/20, 12:18 PM - Jason Greenberg: I don't quite understand the altruism
7/12/20, 12:19 PM - Alex Starr: They seem to really like basically “this will enable me to help people”
7/12/20, 12:19 PM - Alex Starr: It’s kind of a played out angle but important to include I think
7/12/20, 12:19 PM - Alex Starr: Obviously more specific is good haha
7/12/20, 12:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ok gotcha
7/12/20, 12:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: yeah sounds like a good idea
7/12/20, 2:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: Any hard questions you were asked that you wished you'd prepared for?
7/12/20, 2:40 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah but they tended to be pretty specific to things I said I was interested in.
7/12/20, 2:41 PM - Alex Starr: My interviews were generally very laid back with like 10-15 minutes of me saying what I’ve done and answering questions then hearing about their research.  The ones where I talked more were generally laid back.
7/12/20, 2:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ok that's good
7/12/20, 2:42 PM - Alex Starr: Who are your interviews with? Professors?
7/12/20, 2:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: I have a 30 minute interview with a student tomorrow
7/12/20, 2:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: And 30 min with a professor on friday
7/12/20, 2:48 PM - Alex Starr: Oh nice.  Student one is a good sign imo.
7/12/20, 2:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah?
7/12/20, 2:49 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah implies it’s sort of a final round thing I think
7/12/20, 2:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: lets pray lol
7/12/20, 2:50 PM - Matt Casali: That would be awesome
7/12/20, 4:02 PM - Alex Starr: But either way you’ve got this! People seemed to think my interviews were decent and you’ll be waaaaaay better at it haha
7/12/20, 4:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Bruh I've been in those socratic seminars where you calmly decimate the competition
7/12/20, 4:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: And thank you, def nervous
7/12/20, 4:15 PM - Alex Starr: Nah there’s no need to be.  Plus it can be good to be nervous sometimes.  My interview go to is essentially way too much energy and nervousness can fuel that
7/12/20, 4:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: That's true
7/12/20, 11:04 PM - Parker: Hahaha
7/12/20, 11:04 PM - Parker: good luck jason!!
7/12/20, 11:05 PM - Parker: i got my 2nd round interview tmrw too
7/13/20, 12:14 AM - Tim Ko: Ayy gang gang
7/13/20, 1:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: First interview down
7/13/20, 1:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: It was a fourth year PhD student and I felt like we connected. I think I could have elaborated more in certain areas but overall felt good after
7/13/20, 1:29 PM - Alex Starr: Nice! Next is the Professor?
7/13/20, 1:31 PM - Parker: noice
7/13/20, 1:49 PM - Tim Ko: That’s awesome!
7/13/20, 3:41 PM - Ricky: Ayyyyyy that’s awesome J!
7/13/20, 3:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yup
7/13/20, 6:20 PM - Tim Ko: Damn they closing California back again
7/13/20, 6:20 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah indoor stuff right?
7/13/20, 6:21 PM - Tim Ko: Yup
7/13/20, 6:21 PM - Collin Hurst: Should’ve been that way for a while
7/13/20, 6:21 PM - Collin Hurst: Some businesses for indoor don’t follow guidelines at all rip
7/13/20, 6:22 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah ikr
7/13/20, 7:47 PM - Jason Greenberg: Damn not that I want anyone to go to hair salons but I got a “We’re opening!” email blast from mine AND they announced they were opening a second location
7/13/20, 7:47 PM - Jason Greenberg: It’s gotta suck BEEG time to be a hair dresser rn
7/13/20, 7:48 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah closed now right?
7/13/20, 8:06 PM - Parker: Yeah barbers definitely got fucked by this
7/13/20, 8:06 PM - Parker: i was talking about it to my barber in eugene
7/13/20, 8:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah
7/13/20, 8:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: Open for 48 hours only
7/13/20, 8:36 PM - Alex Starr: My dad is contemplating it
7/13/20, 8:36 PM - Alex Starr: He has a mane
7/13/20, 9:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: Damn wanna sneak a sneaky pic?
7/13/20, 9:19 PM - Alex Starr: Nah
7/13/20, 9:29 PM - Tim Ko: Alex ur whole fam should go to Ricky’s mom to get their haircut
7/13/20, 9:29 PM - Tim Ko: Doctor/barber 😄😄
7/13/20, 9:29 PM - Parker: ^
7/15/20, 12:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: Darren do you use a reMarkable?
7/15/20, 12:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: @16509468395
7/15/20, 12:13 PM - Vaughn: That does seem like a darren thing
7/15/20, 12:15 PM - Darren: I don't use one personally, but I recommend it to my dad and he got one and loved it (he returned it because the new models coming out soon)
7/15/20, 12:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: Good to know
7/15/20, 12:16 PM - Darren: I tried it for a day or two when I was home and the software on the tablet is kinda weak, but the pen on paper feel is actually really solid and the new one should be even better
7/15/20, 12:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: ok that's cool
7/15/20, 12:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: yeah I'm looking into the new one potentially
7/15/20, 12:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: Seems to be the best option for the pen and paper feel people say
7/15/20, 12:22 PM - Darren: I'd agree with that statement
7/15/20, 12:23 PM - Darren: Getting a surface or an ipad would be a way better experience if you want a great software experience (and want to be able to use big apps with it), but if you really care about the pen on paper feel you have to go with the reMarkable
7/15/20, 12:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: Do you use either of those? Or does anyone else?
7/15/20, 12:47 PM - Alex Starr: I have used all but remarkable.  They are fine.  Windows sucks.
7/15/20, 12:47 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
7/15/20, 12:50 PM - Darren: Niki seemed to enjoy writing/taking notes on her surface
7/15/20, 12:51 PM - Darren: And iPad OS is getting way better writing support in the next update
7/15/20, 1:02 PM - Parker: I know a bunch of people who used an ipad in classes and stuff and have heard good things
7/15/20, 1:02 PM - Parker: but i haven’t personally
7/15/20, 1:12 PM - Alex Starr: But I’ve always been restricted by the whole my writing isn’t legible on paper.
7/15/20, 3:46 PM - Vaughn: 500 pushups in a full 24 hrs is def doable
7/15/20, 3:46 PM - Alex Starr: Hell its doable in 12
7/15/20, 3:46 PM - Collin Hurst: I’ll do 1000 in 12 rn
7/15/20, 3:46 PM - Alex Starr: I’m betting even I could do it in my piss poor state
7/15/20, 8:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: Guys you all wet your hands first before using soap right?
7/15/20, 8:11 PM - Tim Ko: Yup
7/15/20, 8:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: Instead of going in dry like a savage
7/15/20, 8:13 PM - Alex Starr: Not for foamy soap
7/15/20, 8:13 PM - Alex Starr: Other soap yes
7/15/20, 8:14 PM - Matt Casali: I thought you said soups
7/15/20, 8:15 PM - Parker: yeah
7/15/20, 8:17 PM - Vaughn: When else would your hands even get wet?
7/15/20, 8:19 PM - Jason Greenberg: lol
7/15/20, 8:37 PM - Ricky: Is there someone who is not doing it this way? Has Hayley been going in raw?
7/15/20, 8:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: Dude she poured soap on my hands before I turned the water on
7/15/20, 8:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: I was like, are you educated?
7/15/20, 8:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: Jk but had to clear that up
7/15/20, 8:42 PM - Ricky: Just kidding about questioning her education, or jk about it ever a happening
7/15/20, 8:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: questioning her education
7/15/20, 8:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: I can say that stuff to you guys but that seemed mean
7/15/20, 8:45 PM - Parker: Haha
7/15/20, 8:46 PM - Ricky: Haha, I don’t think that’s mean, seems playful
7/15/20, 8:47 PM - Ricky: Grace and I deff get each other with things of equal or greater meanness
7/15/20, 8:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: Alright alright I just realized I was doing it behind her back is all
7/15/20, 8:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: I hadn't gotten the chance to question her education in person
7/15/20, 8:48 PM - Ricky: Ohhhh gotcha gotcha
7/15/20, 8:52 PM - Matt Casali: She may have only gone through preschool for all we know
7/15/20, 8:52 PM - Matt Casali: They dont cover it there
7/15/20, 8:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: I forget to we go to the same preschool matt?
7/15/20, 8:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: did we*
7/15/20, 8:57 PM - Tim Ko: Sign of a great relationship ☺️
7/15/20, 8:58 PM - Tim Ko: Or a really really shitty one, but u guys have been together for more than 2 years so my money is on the former
7/15/20, 8:59 PM - Ricky: 3*
7/15/20, 8:59 PM - Ricky: Same with Jason and Hayley!!
7/15/20, 9:03 PM - Tim Ko: Ayyyy that’s right
7/15/20, 9:06 PM - Matt Casali: I went to Stratford did you??
7/15/20, 9:06 PM - Matt Casali: :)
7/15/20, 9:07 PM - Parker: Montecito gang
7/15/20, 9:10 PM - Darren: Hahaha
7/15/20, 10:18 PM - Jason Greenberg: Update from Hayley she says she only “goes in raw sometimes”
7/15/20, 11:18 PM - Parker: good to know
7/16/20, 10:33 AM - Ricky: The truth comes out
7/16/20, 10:35 AM - Alex Starr: I did it once on accident never again
7/16/20, 5:12 PM - Ricky: ONE WEEK
7/16/20, 5:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: Until
7/16/20, 5:22 PM - Ricky: Baeeeeeeeesbol

7/16/20, 6:01 PM - Tim Ko: Gang
7/16/20, 6:01 PM - Tim Ko: GANG
7/16/20, 9:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: Got to 2nd today in Agar FFA
7/16/20, 9:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: It was crazy, once I got large enough to see the first place guy, it was clear the gap in size between us was massive. He was easily 50x larger and just meandered over SO slow to kill me
7/16/20, 9:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: <Media omitted>
7/16/20, 9:32 PM - Collin Hurst: I believed you haha
7/16/20, 9:32 PM - Collin Hurst: That’s what she said
7/16/20, 9:32 PM - Collin Hurst: Phrasing*
7/16/20, 9:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: Fuck haha
7/16/20, 10:38 PM - Parker: GANG
7/17/20, 1:50 PM - Alex Starr: My sister just crashed the car... into our other car lol.
7/17/20, 1:50 PM - Darren: How bad?
7/17/20, 1:56 PM - Alex Starr: Fixable easily luckily
7/17/20, 1:56 PM - Alex Starr: But we nearly went from 2 to 0 (the other is ironically broken)
7/17/20, 2:06 PM - Tim Ko: Oh my goodness
7/17/20, 2:06 PM - Tim Ko: What happened?
7/17/20, 2:16 PM - Alex Starr: She just backed into it
7/17/20, 2:16 PM - Alex Starr: Lamely.
7/17/20, 2:17 PM - Alex Starr: No one hurt
7/17/20, 2:17 PM - Vaughn: Jeeze
7/17/20, 2:17 PM - Alex Starr: Tho tbh I’ve been pretty out of it the last couple days.  The pain medicine they put me on is having some side effects
7/17/20, 2:17 PM - Vaughn: If your gunna crash your car into another car at least do it in a cool way
7/17/20, 2:17 PM - Alex Starr: Right?
7/17/20, 2:17 PM - Vaughn: Or hurt at least one person gosh
7/17/20, 2:18 PM - Alex Starr: That’s what I was saying
7/17/20, 2:19 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
7/17/20, 2:19 PM - Tim Ko: At least have it be pulling out and side swiping a door dash car 😁
7/17/20, 2:20 PM - Tim Ko: Dang, what kinda side effects? Has ur pain been better?
7/17/20, 2:24 PM - Alex Starr: No it isn’t supposed to kick in for a couple weeks.  Main thing is just feeling tired and out of it
7/17/20, 2:38 PM - Tim Ko: Ah I see for sure
7/17/20, 2:51 PM - Parker: i was gonna say this hahaha
7/17/20, 2:51 PM - Parker: atleast rip the front bumper off or something
7/17/20, 2:55 PM - Alex Starr: Weirdly feels like it’s not me taking the actions.  Like when I baked yesterday it felt like I wasn’t focused on it at all even though I definitely was
7/17/20, 2:55 PM - Alex Starr: She actually did just get back from door dashing so...
7/17/20, 3:08 PM - Tim Ko: Interesting, seems like it affects ur concentration a bit?
7/17/20, 3:08 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
7/17/20, 3:11 PM - Alex Starr: More than a bit and not really concentration.  Hard to describe better than “pretty out of it” but it’s not great
7/17/20, 3:54 PM - Parker: Lmao
7/17/20, 4:12 PM - Tim Ko: I see
7/17/20, 5:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: Like dissociating?
7/17/20, 5:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: That is strange
7/17/20, 5:12 PM - Alex Starr: Kind of dissociated yeah
7/17/20, 5:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: Is it bad enough that you’d want to try a different painkiller?
7/17/20, 5:16 PM - Alex Starr: My neurologist said to give it a few days but if it doesn’t improve I’ll quit.  It’s an SNRI so not exactly a painkiller but treats neuropathic pain.
7/17/20, 5:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: Gotcha
7/19/20, 11:19 AM - Ricky: Hello, would anybody be free Thursday at 7pm to watch the A’s opening game and chat?

7/20/20, 1:50 PM - Ricky: Damn, can u not go to a place with better WiFi?
7/20/20, 1:50 PM - Matt Casali: I accidentally yelled god fucking damn it while they were recording me haha

7/20/20, 1:50 PM - Ricky: They’ll remember that
7/20/20, 1:50 PM - Tim Ko: Oh noooo I’m so sorry Matt 😢😢
7/20/20, 1:50 PM - Tim Ko: Haha
7/20/20, 1:51 PM - Matt Casali: I tried to do it in a room because you need to like have a blank room with good lighting but I think I'm just gonna do it right next to my router and ask everyone to leave the house for a couple hours
7/20/20, 1:52 PM - Tim Ko: Would u not want to go to Stockton?
7/20/20, 1:52 PM - Tim Ko: It’s a little far but at least you’ll have peace of mind that u can take the test
7/20/20, 1:52 PM - Matt Casali: I could?? But 2h is a lot
7/20/20, 1:53 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah true
7/20/20, 1:53 PM - Matt Casali: I'd rather just try it online one more time and then reschedule it later for stockton if I have to
7/20/20, 1:53 PM - Tim Ko: Ah for sure
7/20/20, 1:53 PM - Matt Casali: I'm just pissed that they kept logging me back in and then one time decided that I couldn't continue the test
7/20/20, 1:53 PM - Matt Casali: Bs
7/20/20, 1:54 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah that’s rough, I can’t imagine taking a test and having to deal with WiFi issues at the same time
7/20/20, 1:54 PM - Tim Ko: Would throw me off my concentration
7/20/20, 1:54 PM - Tim Ko: Also cuz one of my pet peeves is bad internet lol

7/25/20, 10:51 AM - Alex Starr: Might be utah? I’ve certainly been to dinosaur themed things there
7/25/20, 10:55 AM - Alex Starr: Anyone have recommendations for local poke places?
7/25/20, 11:03 AM - Parker: I know a good place in eugene if you’re willing to drive
7/25/20, 11:29 AM - Alex Starr: For dinosaur themed poke?
7/25/20, 11:32 AM - Parker: yeah
7/25/20, 11:55 AM - Matt Casali: I've heard of it and might do that!
7/26/20, 1:51 PM - Tim Ko: Ohtani’s first start since surgery: 5 runs, didn’t record an out, replaced in the first inning
7/26/20, 2:15 PM - Parker: oof
7/26/20, 2:17 PM - Ricky: Yup biggggg rip
7/26/20, 2:29 PM - Tim Ko: This A’s player is making his mlb debut today and so far he’s grounded into a double play in his first 2 at bats 🤦‍♂️
7/26/20, 2:29 PM - Ricky: Lmao, machin?
7/26/20, 2:34 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah lol
7/26/20, 3:09 PM - Parker: stud
7/26/20, 3:47 PM - Ricky: Verlander our for the season 👀 A’s take AL west? 👀
7/26/20, 3:55 PM - Tim Ko: Yeahhh I saw that
7/26/20, 3:55 PM - Tim Ko: Hope so
7/26/20, 3:55 PM - Tim Ko: Tho it doesn’t matter as much this year cuz every team that makes the playoffs play a 3 game series
7/26/20, 3:56 PM - Tim Ko: And I have absolutely no faith in the A’s when it comes to the playoffs
7/26/20, 3:56 PM - Tim Ko: Unless luzardo is pitching
7/26/20, 3:57 PM - Ricky: Gang,  can hardly trust em to hold a 5 run lead 😂
7/26/20, 4:20 PM - Tim Ko: Ikr lol
7/26/20, 4:51 PM - Parker: tested negative gang
7/26/20, 4:51 PM - Alex Starr: Nice
7/26/20, 4:56 PM - Tim Ko: Gang gang
7/26/20, 4:56 PM - Parker: was slightly uncomfy
7/27/20, 12:16 PM - Alex Starr: Lol
7/27/20, 12:16 PM - Alex Starr: Yes it was
7/27/20, 10:33 PM - Darren: Jesus my SC housemates from SoCal got back today/yesterday to clean the house for move out and they are throwing a party downstairs
7/27/20, 10:33 PM - Vaughn: Goddamn is your landlord inspecting soon?
7/27/20, 10:37 PM - Parker: big yikes
7/27/20, 10:39 PM - Darren: Im honestly not sure. The one person who talks to the landlord is still in SoCal because their dad is in the hospital (not covid related as far as I know) so it's just kinda a shit show
7/27/20, 10:45 PM - Tim Ko: Dang haha
7/28/20, 5:37 PM - Darren: @16505758873 can you describe where/when/what your covid test was like?
7/28/20, 5:38 PM - Alex Starr: I also had one, but went to the er
7/28/20, 5:38 PM - Darren: Pray tell
7/28/20, 5:38 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t think you should do the er one unless you have symptoms
7/28/20, 5:40 PM - Alex Starr: I have another one scheduled for August 2nd but that one I got referred for.  You drive up and get the test.  Feels like 4 inches of swab tickling your uvula through your nose.  Painful but over pretty fast.
7/28/20, 5:40 PM - Darren: How'd you schedule your test?
7/28/20, 5:41 PM - Darren: It is it literally like a drive through?
7/28/20, 5:41 PM - Alex Starr: Yes
7/28/20, 5:41 PM - Darren: How long did you wait for results?
7/28/20, 5:41 PM - Alex Starr: Through Stanford myhealth
7/28/20, 5:41 PM - Alex Starr: I waited 4 hours, but it can be that short or two weeks
7/28/20, 5:42 PM - Darren: Maybe the ER one is faster than typical?
7/28/20, 5:42 PM - Alex Starr: Definitely
7/28/20, 5:42 PM - Darren: Something I'll look into for sure
7/28/20, 5:42 PM - Alex Starr: I think 1-2 days is the norm
7/28/20, 5:42 PM - Darren: And that's for viral tests, not antibodies?
7/28/20, 5:42 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah the antibody test is by all accounts useless
7/28/20, 5:43 PM - Darren: Makes sense
7/28/20, 5:43 PM - Alex Starr: It shouldn’t be that hard to get tested I think
7/28/20, 5:44 PM - Darren: Ok, thanks for the info
7/28/20, 5:44 PM - Alex Starr: Np
7/28/20, 5:49 PM - Tim Ko: They trying to develop a spit test
7/28/20, 5:49 PM - Alex Starr: It’s not bad enough that I feel like we need it tho
7/28/20, 5:50 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah, but it’s cheaper I think
7/28/20, 5:50 PM - Tim Ko: And faster results
7/28/20, 5:51 PM - Tim Ko: I thought the antibody test shows if u could be immune or not
7/28/20, 5:52 PM - Parker: I called around a few places in eugene for rapid testing and everywhere directed me to an urgent care so i called there, they had walk ups but i had to book a spot online but they were available anytime so i booked one for right away(i was driving home to family yesterday after being in a few places so i needed results basically within the day), went and checked in and then they swabbed my nose like alex said, was uncomfortable and a little painful but not like terrible, and then i waited in the room for 15 mins and the doctor came back in and said i was negative and that was about it
7/28/20, 5:53 PM - Parker: I lucked out with the quick turnaround though bc most of the regular medical centers in eugene I called 1) only took appts if you were experiencing symptoms and 2) didn’t have a 15 min turnaround
7/28/20, 5:54 PM - Darren: Wow 15 minutes is crazy fast
7/28/20, 5:54 PM - Darren: Ok, thanks
7/28/20, 5:54 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah wut, 15 mins?? That’s dope
7/28/20, 6:04 PM - Parker: Yeah haha
7/28/20, 6:04 PM - Parker: Hanna got an appt here that was a rapid testing center that was the same
7/28/20, 6:05 PM - Parker: idk if those are being more and more prominent or what
7/28/20, 6:05 PM - Alex Starr: Antibodies doesn’t mean immune
7/28/20, 6:06 PM - Alex Starr: Most places pool their tests
7/28/20, 6:22 PM - Tim Ko: But it means u had it and the thought is that u can be immune
7/28/20, 6:37 PM - Alex Starr: Can
7/28/20, 6:42 PM - Parker: don’t they not know if you can get it again or not though
7/28/20, 6:54 PM - Tim Ko: Nah it’s uncertain
7/28/20, 6:57 PM - Parker: yeah makes sense
7/28/20, 6:57 PM - Parker: so the antibodies test only shows you that you had it or not?
7/28/20, 6:57 PM - Parker: or can you have them even if you were never had it
7/28/20, 6:57 PM - Alex Starr: It only shows if you had it or not
7/28/20, 6:58 PM - Parker: got it
7/28/20, 6:58 PM - Alex Starr: You can’t have them, but false positives (you don’t have them and positive test) or false negatives are possible
7/28/20, 7:10 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah
7/28/20, 7:12 PM - Tim Ko: Also someone with a positive antibody test may be inclined to be less responsible with distancing and stuff so that’s not good
7/28/20, 8:19 PM - Parker: anyone watch last chance U?
7/29/20, 9:11 AM - Ricky: Also, I’m sure you can find them, but my mom was saying that testing centers and supply for COVID tests in general is running out because of the huge rush of people getting tested
7/29/20, 9:16 AM - Matt Casali: Prob cause Donya got tested 5 times in 1 week
7/29/20, 9:16 AM - Matt Casali: They ran out
7/29/20, 9:18 AM - Ricky: Lmao
7/29/20, 9:43 AM - Jason Greenberg: Lolol
7/29/20, 10:38 AM - Tim Ko: Hahaha
7/29/20, 10:38 AM - Tim Ko: Impacting the community, one test at a time 😄
7/29/20, 10:53 AM - Ricky: https://www.mlb.com/app/atbat/cheer
7/29/20, 10:54 AM - Ricky: Found this, apparently you can make a noise for the crowd online!? Not sure how it works but fun addition!
7/29/20, 10:56 AM - Tim Ko: Yooooo
7/29/20, 10:57 AM - Tim Ko: Aw it only lets u cheer clap or boo
7/29/20, 10:57 AM - Tim Ko: I wanted to do gang gang
7/29/20, 11:01 AM - Ricky: Hahaha
7/29/20, 11:01 AM - Vaughn: Imagine watching a game and faintly hearing a cardboard cut-out saying gang gang all game
7/29/20, 11:01 AM - Ricky: Can someone make a bot that will spam boos when we want?
7/29/20, 11:02 AM - Ricky: Hahaha
7/29/20, 4:23 PM - Parker: Joe kelly got suspended wtf is that
7/29/20, 4:38 PM - Tim Ko: Jeez
7/29/20, 4:38 PM - Tim Ko: I mean idk if it was intentional or not cuz cuz he was wild all inning
7/29/20, 4:39 PM - Parker: who cares though
7/29/20, 4:39 PM - Parker: 8 games??
7/29/20, 4:40 PM - Parker: there was no warning beforehand and even if there was dudes who get ejected don’t even get that much haha
7/29/20, 4:44 PM - Tim Ko: Lol u can’t not punish someone who intentionally aims for the head
7/29/20, 4:44 PM - Tim Ko: I bet if the pitches were at the legs he wouldn’t have gotten 8
7/29/20, 5:22 PM - Parker: Im not saying they couldn’t punish him but strickland and harper literally threw punches on the mound and both got less😂 also the fact that they barely punished the astros players for the whole scandal and then do this
7/29/20, 5:22 PM - Parker: i just think it’s extremely soft on the leagues part
7/29/20, 5:23 PM - Parker: they better be ready to hand out a bunch of suspensions this year if that’s the case haha
7/29/20, 5:27 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah they definitly should have punished the astros more
7/29/20, 5:27 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah true but Strickland threw at Harpers thighs
7/29/20, 5:27 PM - Tim Ko: U can actually kill someone by throwing at their head
7/29/20, 5:29 PM - Parker: But the fact that he didn’t hit him in the head just means it’s all subjective
7/29/20, 5:29 PM - Parker: if he hit him in the head it’s a different story
7/29/20, 5:30 PM - Parker: The number of games might have to do with Kelly’s past apparently he’s a repeat offender lol
7/29/20, 5:30 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah probably
7/29/20, 5:32 PM - Tim Ko: I just remmeber in like 2012 he predicted to everyone that he was gonna win the cy young award but then ended up having like the worse starting pitcher season in history
7/29/20, 5:32 PM - Parker: Lmao
7/29/20, 9:58 PM - Parker: <Media omitted>
7/29/20, 10:17 PM - Tim Ko: Lmaoooo
7/30/20, 8:49 AM - Parker: anyone have interest in getting dinner tn? maybe get stuff to go and have a picnic or something

8/5/20, 1:01 PM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
8/5/20, 2:07 PM - Ricky: That’s a bit up there on the price range haha sry
8/5/20, 2:08 PM - Collin Hurst: I meaannnnnn 1 Bdrm would be less then 500$ if it’s not the master
8/5/20, 2:09 PM - Darren: That's $1500 for the whole house?
8/5/20, 2:09 PM - Darren: Honestly I'm down to pay < $500 for a bedroom in tahoe so long as the internet is fine
8/5/20, 2:09 PM - Darren: That's less than my rent with my parents so it would be the financially responsible move for me to do that
8/5/20, 2:11 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah I’m worried about the internet
8/5/20, 2:13 PM - Darren: If you ask them for an internet speed test and it's decent, I'd join
8/5/20, 2:15 PM - Parker: $1500/month?
8/5/20, 2:19 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah total
8/5/20, 2:19 PM - Collin Hurst: For 3bdrm
8/5/20, 2:20 PM - Matt Casali: 500/mo for a single is pretty damn good
8/5/20, 2:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: That's a great deal
8/5/20, 2:38 PM - Parker: Yeah that is
8/5/20, 2:38 PM - Parker: sadly can not commit to multiple months haha
8/5/20, 2:38 PM - Tim Ko: That’s pretty sick haha
8/5/20, 2:39 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah make sure u can run Warzone
8/5/20, 2:47 PM - Matt Casali: When would you be moving?
8/5/20, 2:48 PM - Matt Casali: If its next year and things are clearing up then we should all definitely visit a couple times
8/5/20, 2:50 PM - Vaughn: If internet is good I'm down
8/5/20, 2:51 PM - Darren: I imagine it's not gonna be cheap as soon as things start clearing up
8/5/20, 2:52 PM - Alex Starr: You guys should wait a month
8/5/20, 3:06 PM - Ricky: I interpreted that as $1500 per 3 bedroom
8/5/20, 3:06 PM - Ricky: Like the $1500 / 3br
8/5/20, 3:06 PM - Ricky: But if it’s only 500 I may very easily be down
8/5/20, 3:08 PM - Ricky: <Media omitted>
8/5/20, 3:17 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah you guys wouldn’t have to commit, I’d just be putting down the money and it could be flexible for you guys
8/5/20, 3:17 PM - Collin Hurst: And then you could get tested when if you want to move back home
8/5/20, 3:34 PM - Vaughn: 🤣🤣
8/5/20, 3:38 PM - Darren: Very generous
8/5/20, 3:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ahahahaha
8/5/20, 3:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: It’s a four second video and he didn’t say it for the first four seconds almost I didn’t think he would lmaoooo
8/5/20, 3:48 PM - Parker: hahaha
8/5/20, 6:04 PM - Tim Ko: Lmaoooo
8/5/20, 6:04 PM - Tim Ko: Where is this from?
8/5/20, 6:16 PM - Matt Casali: Does anyone wanna come to Santa Cruz next week?
8/5/20, 6:17 PM - Collin Hurst: I’m down
8/5/20, 6:19 PM - Matt Casali: Cool
8/5/20, 6:22 PM - Matt Casali: Honestly the chances were low so I'll take it
8/5/20, 6:28 PM - Parker: I could be down
8/5/20, 6:55 PM - Tim Ko: I can do weekends!
8/5/20, 6:55 PM - Tim Ko: Not weekdays tho
8/5/20, 7:42 PM - Matt Casali: I can do this Saturday but thats it if its not a week day
8/5/20, 7:53 PM - Tim Ko: Oh shoot I don’t think I can do this Saturday
8/5/20, 7:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: I could be convinced
8/5/20, 8:05 PM - Ricky: I start work on Thursday
8/5/20, 8:05 PM - Ricky: So before then or the weekend and I’m down
8/5/20, 8:06 PM - Alex Starr: Nice!
8/5/20, 9:55 PM - Tim Ko: Ganggggg
8/5/20, 10:09 PM - Parker: Yuhhh
8/6/20, 6:17 AM - Jason Greenberg: Woohoo!!
8/6/20, 11:34 AM - Matt Casali: Hey this is not really directed towards everyone, but i kinda wanted to bring it up here just cause I feel like my feelings are directed towards the group for some reason? There's been a couple times recently where people have come to Santa Cruz and haven't told me or things have happened in Santa cruz and I didn't find out until afterwards and I want to express that I've been pretty hurt by it lately. I know Ricky let me know that he was here a couple days ago but that was like when he was already here and already heading out to do stuff. I didn't know Vaughn was here until I saw it on a snapchat story. I feel like I've expressed a strong desire to hang out and I just kinda wanna be included in things that are socially distanced. It especially hurt after trying to get a bike ride together for a while and it not really happening only to learn that there was another bike ride that happened like a week later without me in santa cruz. I just would like to be thought of and asked, I think. I dont mean to blame because I know that no one had malicient intent here or intended to hurt me, but I'm hurt nonetheless.
8/6/20, 11:43 AM - Tim Ko: Thanks for sharing Matt. Sorry about the bike rides! We could definitly work on our communication about things that are happening.
8/6/20, 11:46 AM - Parker: Sorry you feel that way matt, i honestly had no idea people had been going to santa cruz, maybe i just missed it in the chat, but i’ve also been gone for most of it i think
8/6/20, 11:46 AM - Matt Casali: Thats okay, Tim! I think I'm also just feeling a bit lonely and I just wanna hang out with you guys. I'll definitely be as proactive as I can about planning things as well.
8/6/20, 11:46 AM - Parker: Definitely down to make a trip over soon though im sad i missed a bunch of hikes and hangouts when i was out of town
8/6/20, 11:46 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah and I don't think people have gone to sc a ton, just a couple times
8/6/20, 11:47 AM - Jason Greenberg: I’m in Parker’s boat
8/6/20, 11:47 AM - Jason Greenberg: We should plan a poker night also side note
8/6/20, 11:47 AM - Alex Starr: Had no idea about any of it, sorry you were hurt by it.  If I manage to muster the energy to go to SC, you will know
8/6/20, 11:47 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah I think I have to be less picky too?
8/6/20, 11:48 AM - Matt Casali: A poker night could be fun
8/6/20, 11:48 AM - Parker: Down, also should start to organize a CAH
8/6/20, 11:48 AM - Matt Casali: I'm glad to hear that, I hope you will be able to soon for your sake as well as mine
8/6/20, 11:49 AM - Vaughn: Definitely on me, ive been to SC 4 times in the last week and I'm sorry I didn't reach out
8/6/20, 11:50 AM - Tim Ko: Down down
8/6/20, 11:50 AM - Tim Ko: !!
8/6/20, 11:51 AM - Matt Casali: Thats okay, Vaughn. Last night was Rohan's bday and I couldn't have gone to that. I just wanna see ya when I can. I just want to know if there's a reason that you guys would maybe not invite me?
8/6/20, 11:51 AM - Vaughn: Not sure if itd make you feel better, but i also wasn't invited to that bike ride cause it was only for the athletically elite
8/6/20, 11:51 AM - Vaughn: /people with nice ass bikes
8/6/20, 11:51 AM - Collin Hurst: Same sorry Matt, though my house does include Vaughn in our quarantine circle so that’s why he’s been here a lot for activities that I thought you wouldn’t want to join in
8/6/20, 11:51 AM - Collin Hurst: Like I think the last 3 times were for poker nights
8/6/20, 11:53 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah I get that, and I wouldn't want to like engage with your whole house. But I'd be down to social distance outside in your backyard or see you guys at my place, just to see you. I get that maybe I wouldn't be doing what you guys have been doing but we can always do something else too.
8/6/20, 11:53 AM - Matt Casali: I think it's more that I would like to be asked and thought of.
8/6/20, 11:54 AM - Collin Hurst: Yeah we should do it! I think I haven’t been hanging with you that much cause I associate going back to mv with herd hangouts
8/6/20, 11:55 AM - Jason Greenberg: I’ve been starting to make some cards
8/6/20, 11:57 AM - Matt Casali: I also totally get that vaughn is closer to your house so I definitely don't have to hang out every time you guys are together in sc, but maybe if its happening weekly then we can do something in the day one of the times before you guys have a poker night
8/6/20, 11:57 AM - Matt Casali: Like I said, I'm just pretty lonely
8/6/20, 11:57 AM - Darren: Really gonna act like UCSC and Chill and Blaze doesn't exist
8/6/20, 11:57 AM - Matt Casali: I think a lot of us are probably in the same boat
8/6/20, 11:58 AM - Collin Hurst: Don’t expose our secret chats shhhhhh
8/6/20, 11:58 AM - Parker: for sure
8/6/20, 11:58 AM - Parker: i’ve been feeling that to an extent
8/6/20, 11:58 AM - Vaughn: I'll definitely put more effort into reaching out and making a day out of my visits. A couple times ive gone down the 17 at 9pm and drove back to SJ at 2am
8/6/20, 12:00 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah like those times I definitely don't expect you to necessarily reach out
8/6/20, 12:00 PM - Matt Casali: Just if you're coming over to sc a couple times a week, I'd like to see ya
8/6/20, 12:01 PM - Vaughn: For sure for sure, and the drive is really nothing for me, im almost never doing anything important over here
8/6/20, 12:02 PM - Vaughn: collin texted me asking if i wanted to play tennis so i put pants on and left immediately
8/6/20, 12:02 PM - Vaughn: And I'll do the same for you anytime matt!
8/6/20, 12:02 PM - Alex Starr: Well maybe not put on pants
8/6/20, 12:02 PM - Darren: The king of comedy
8/6/20, 12:03 PM - Alex Starr: Better to rule in hell
8/6/20, 12:04 PM - Matt Casali: 😊
8/6/20, 12:04 PM - Ricky: Matt would you wanna surf sometime soon?
8/6/20, 12:05 PM - Matt Casali: If anyone is available to come to sc for a smash tournament next week I could make us a big dinner
8/6/20, 12:05 PM - Matt Casali: I could be down, my surfboard is in mv though and I'm not entirely sure where my wetsuit is
8/6/20, 12:06 PM - Matt Casali: But I could definitely try to find it when I go there next!
8/6/20, 12:06 PM - Tim Ko: I end work at 6:30 so I could reach Santa Cruz by 7:15ish
8/6/20, 12:06 PM - Ricky: Gotcha, I think for me smash is just a problem cuz it requires us to be so close together but if there is a clear distanced format I’d be down
8/6/20, 12:06 PM - Tim Ko: I would be down! We’d be in backyard?
8/6/20, 12:06 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah
8/6/20, 12:07 PM - Tim Ko: Plus each of us touching the controllers
8/6/20, 12:07 PM - Matt Casali: I think there is, but yeah I'll definitely research it
8/6/20, 12:07 PM - Matt Casali: Also surf rentals are probably open so i could try that
8/6/20, 12:08 PM - Darren: You could do it like a real tournament and have two monitors on different tables
8/6/20, 12:08 PM - Matt Casali: With a projector for spectarors
8/6/20, 12:08 PM - Collin Hurst: One of my friends has 2 or 3 wave storms we can borrow and our house has 1
8/6/20, 12:08 PM - Matt Casali: Ayy
8/6/20, 12:08 PM - Collin Hurst: And also 4 short less but I don’t think anyone wants those
8/6/20, 12:09 PM - Collin Hurst: Short boards*
8/6/20, 12:09 PM - Alex Starr: I’m in the same boat as Ricky and Tim on the smash tourney front.  Surfing might literally kill me, but poker/CAH I’m down for
8/6/20, 12:11 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah maybe smash is a no go but we'll see
8/6/20, 12:14 PM - Vaughn: Idea, we all play on solo joycons, stay six feet apart, and hook it up to a projector
8/6/20, 12:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: Very much in
8/6/20, 12:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: Y’all need to make some cards
8/6/20, 12:16 PM - Vaughn: I can also emulate a gamecube on my computer and screenshare with yall to play melee and mario party
8/6/20, 12:17 PM - Matt Casali: I will, but I'm cautious
8/6/20, 12:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: I understand why and I’m still down to drop any filtering
8/6/20, 12:38 PM - Parker: I like the rule of no filtering and unlimited card dumps
8/6/20, 12:38 PM - Parker: as long as people put some effort into their cards haha
8/6/20, 12:38 PM - Parker: I was gonna say if rentals are open i could potentially be down sometime! i only went that one time in SB but wanna try again
8/6/20, 12:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: I will say unlimited card dumps are frustrating from a creator's perspective
8/6/20, 12:39 PM - Alex Starr: This
8/6/20, 12:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: We blew through hundreds of cards in like 40 mins
8/6/20, 12:39 PM - Parker: Fair but so is making a bunch of cards and not having many of them make it haha
8/6/20, 12:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: I made 300
8/6/20, 12:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: It took me months
8/6/20, 12:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: Matt sent me like 20
8/6/20, 12:41 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah it was definitely a volume thing
8/6/20, 12:41 PM - Matt Casali: But I also don't know if I can do 300 haha
8/6/20, 12:41 PM - Alex Starr: I will also say when the winning card is a write in of “Ethan” it is pretty shitty
8/6/20, 12:41 PM - Parker: is there a setting to limit how many cards we get in a hand? Iirc we got like 10 where normally you get 7
8/6/20, 12:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah too many write ins
8/6/20, 12:41 PM - Parker: that could help with running through them
8/6/20, 12:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: We always get 10
8/6/20, 12:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: But yes there is a setting
8/6/20, 12:42 PM - Parker: I thought you get 7 with the normal game
8/6/20, 12:42 PM - Vaughn: If we're doing write ins we may as well play quiplash
8/6/20, 12:42 PM - Alex Starr: Ya I’m pretty sure it’s 7.
8/6/20, 12:42 PM - Vaughn: Which is a fun option we could use that site for
8/6/20, 12:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: the truth has been spat
8/6/20, 12:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: I agree that you're wrong
8/6/20, 12:44 PM - Parker: Also down for jackbox sometime
8/6/20, 12:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: <Media omitted>
8/6/20, 12:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: This ain't Uno bitches
8/6/20, 12:50 PM - Alex Starr: Thank god for that
8/6/20, 12:51 PM - Alex Starr: UNO’s tagline should really be CAH’s
8/6/20, 12:51 PM - Alex Starr: Swap that
8/6/20, 12:51 PM - Alex Starr: Or don’t
8/6/20, 1:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: I agree with this haha
8/6/20, 1:13 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah let’s do jack box!
8/6/20, 1:37 PM - Darren: But it won because it was more funny than any other cards available at the time
8/6/20, 1:57 PM - Tim Ko: Jerry Sandusky on a level 9 range spell is also a classic
8/7/20, 9:15 AM - Jason Greenberg: Are we doing fantasy football?
8/7/20, 9:40 AM - Matt Casali: We should!
8/7/20, 10:09 AM - Ricky: I got no clue how to set it up
8/7/20, 10:09 AM - Ricky: But it was fun and Im down
8/7/20, 10:26 AM - Parker: Yeah let’s do it
8/7/20, 10:26 AM - Parker: I can set it up
8/7/20, 10:34 AM - Jason Greenberg: Hype
8/7/20, 11:18 AM - Tim Ko: Yooo let do it
8/7/20, 11:18 AM - Tim Ko: Invite Christian Singh and Ethan again
8/7/20, 12:16 PM - Parker: yee
8/7/20, 6:08 PM - Tim Ko: Just did the COVID nasal test, damn that thing goes far into ur nose lol
8/7/20, 6:08 PM - Alex Starr: It literally enters your mouth
8/7/20, 6:09 PM - Parker: Yup haha
8/7/20, 6:16 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah it goes to ur throat through the nose
8/7/20, 6:17 PM - Tim Ko: After it went in it started smelling like the times I get bloody noses
8/7/20, 6:17 PM - Alex Starr: Yep
8/7/20, 6:18 PM - Parker: Haha yeah i kept checking for blood after i got mine
8/7/20, 6:53 PM - Tim Ko: Ok haha good to know it’s not just me
8/7/20, 10:17 PM - Darren: Did you guys know that mountain lion screams sound like a woman being murdered?
8/7/20, 10:17 PM - Darren: https://youtu.be/pxo8X5uIWRE
8/7/20, 10:18 PM - Darren: I was in my tent at 1am last night and heard the most awful, raspy screaming near me and couldn't tell whether there was a crime in process or it was an animal near my tent
8/7/20, 10:18 PM - Matt Casali: Oh no
8/7/20, 10:19 PM - Matt Casali: How did you figure out it was a mountain lion
8/7/20, 10:20 PM - Tim Ko: Oh shit dude
8/7/20, 10:20 PM - Darren: I tried to find my bike light to try to see it on my hill, but I think that was inside the house and I'm still not really allowed in there yet
8/7/20, 10:21 PM - Darren: The next day I described it to my brother and he said that mountain lions scream like a woman possessed by a devil, and that sounded about right. I looked it up on YouTube and the sound matched
8/7/20, 10:23 PM - Parker: Jesus
8/7/20, 10:24 PM - Ricky: Go A’d
8/7/20, 10:25 PM - Ricky: A’s*
And glad it wasn’t actually a woman being murmured
8/7/20, 10:25 PM - Ricky: Murdered

8/11/20, 11:06 AM - Matt Casali: Who would be down to come to sc tomorrow?
8/11/20, 11:06 AM - Jason Greenberg: I’ve got job app stuff but I’d be more down on a weekend

8/11/20, 12:29 PM - Tim Ko: 6 actually
8/11/20, 12:31 PM - Parker: yeah that’s reasonable
8/11/20, 12:32 PM - Parker: 20 games is like a 55 game suspension with a normal length season lol
8/11/20, 12:43 PM - Collin Hurst: Sasha and rohan both have wetsuits I can ask them
8/11/20, 12:46 PM - Matt Casali: Okay it would be a tight fit for me in their wet suits but maybe it would work
8/11/20, 12:51 PM - Matt Casali: Cowell's is probably best for us right?
8/11/20, 12:54 PM - Matt Casali: Pleasure point could be good too
8/11/20, 12:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: 😏
8/11/20, 12:55 PM - Matt Casali: Heh
8/11/20, 12:55 PM - Matt Casali: Alsoooo

8/11/20, 1:00 PM - Matt Casali: The second deadline is more strict
8/11/20, 1:06 PM - Ricky: Wtffff
8/11/20, 1:06 PM - Ricky: Collin won’t be up by then
8/11/20, 1:06 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
8/11/20, 1:07 PM - Tim Ko: Collin can just pull an all mightier
8/11/20, 1:07 PM - Tim Ko: Nighter
8/11/20, 1:07 PM - Ricky: He will have to be mightier than his current form to get up earlier
8/11/20, 1:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: What’s the interview for?
8/11/20, 1:24 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah what I can do anything before 11
8/11/20, 1:24 PM - Collin Hurst: Can’t
8/11/20, 1:25 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah idk about squeezing into their wetsuits Matt sry may just have to let someone else wear them like Vaughn and Jason I think
8/11/20, 1:40 PM - Ricky: Can you do after your interview?
8/11/20, 1:40 PM - Ricky: Or do you also have work then?
8/11/20, 1:40 PM - Ricky: And are the waves bad then?
8/11/20, 2:17 PM - Matt Casali: Sorry about that, I was interviewing
8/11/20, 2:17 PM - Matt Casali: Waves seem like they're better in the morning
8/11/20, 2:18 PM - Matt Casali: My last interview ends at 3:30 and we try after that but it might crowded/not as good
8/11/20, 2:19 PM - Matt Casali: I can ask my surfer housemate
8/11/20, 2:19 PM - Matt Casali: We can also just hang and do something else
8/11/20, 2:19 PM - Ricky: I mean, I’m down for the morning
8/11/20, 2:19 PM - Ricky: And Collin can come or not if he’s willing to commit to getting up
8/11/20, 2:20 PM - Ricky: What if we (whoever wants) surf in the morning
8/11/20, 2:20 PM - Matt Casali: If you wanted to stay most of the day we can go surfing in the morning and then do something later
8/11/20, 2:20 PM - Ricky: Then can hang later in the day, maybe chill with Collin till 3:30 then we can smash or something
8/11/20, 2:21 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah that sounds good to me
8/11/20, 2:21 PM - Ricky: Vaughn u awake and/or down?
8/11/20, 2:31 PM - Parker: Kamala gang
8/11/20, 2:37 PM - Collin Hurst: Jacks is better when tide is low
8/11/20, 2:38 PM - Collin Hurst: /pleasure point
8/11/20, 2:39 PM - Collin Hurst: Doesn’t really have anything to do with morning
8/11/20, 2:42 PM - Ricky: Also personally, starting surfing at 3:30 is just making it a much tighter fit late in the day versus doing it in the morning and being able to be flexible later
8/11/20, 2:43 PM - Collin Hurst: Oki
8/11/20, 2:44 PM - Collin Hurst: Well if Matt has work by 12 we gotta be in the lineup by like 9:30
8/11/20, 2:46 PM - Collin Hurst: Do Id have to wake up at 8:30
8/11/20, 2:46 PM - Collin Hurst: And for those reasons I’m out
8/11/20, 2:46 PM - Collin Hurst: Lol
8/11/20, 2:50 PM - Matt Casali: Low tide is mid-morning tomorrow
8/11/20, 2:51 PM - Matt Casali: We can 100% do something later as well
8/11/20, 2:52 PM - Collin Hurst: I meant in general but yeah tomorrow it is
8/11/20, 2:56 PM - Vaughn: Yeeee down all that
8/11/20, 2:57 PM - Collin Hurst: Also how many people are coming/what are Surfboard/suit rental numbers looking like
8/11/20, 3:00 PM - Matt Casali: I think its looking like you, me, vaughn and Ricky
8/11/20, 3:02 PM - Collin Hurst: Ok that’s a lot more manageable lol
8/11/20, 3:37 PM - Ricky: I also don’t need anything
8/11/20, 3:37 PM - Ricky: I got a board and suit
8/11/20, 3:38 PM - Ricky: Wait so when r we gonna go?
8/11/20, 3:39 PM - Matt Casali: Would you be cool with potentially picking some stuff up from my house in mv ricky? Like my board and wetsuit?
8/11/20, 3:39 PM - Ricky: Yeah sure
8/11/20, 3:39 PM - Matt Casali: If you got here at 9 that would be perfect i think
8/11/20, 3:39 PM - Matt Casali: Unless thats too early
8/11/20, 3:39 PM - Ricky: Can I do it tonight though, don’t wanna deal with it tomorrow morning
8/11/20, 3:40 PM - Ricky: I’m down for that
8/11/20, 3:40 PM - Ricky: As long as we got a hard commit
8/11/20, 3:40 PM - Matt Casali: yeah for sure haha, let me call my parents
8/11/20, 3:40 PM - Ricky: 👌
8/11/20, 3:40 PM - Matt Casali: What do ya think vaughn
8/11/20, 3:59 PM - Vaughn: Works for me! Anyone have an extra board?
8/11/20, 4:00 PM - Matt Casali: My stuff's on the porch ricky!
8/11/20, 4:02 PM - Ricky: Awesome I’ll get it in like 2 hours sry running errands rn
8/11/20, 4:07 PM - Matt Casali: No worries
8/11/20, 4:09 PM - Ricky: Collin, Can I use a lil of your roommates board wax?
8/11/20, 4:11 PM - Matt Casali: Same pls
8/11/20, 4:20 PM - Collin Hurst: I can get a board and suit for you Vaughn
8/11/20, 4:22 PM - Collin Hurst: Do you guys have longboards
8/11/20, 4:23 PM - Parker: what are rental prices?
8/11/20, 4:23 PM - Parker: im down to join next time you guys go
8/11/20, 4:23 PM - Collin Hurst: Probably expensive
8/11/20, 4:23 PM - Parker: i may also be able to borrow my stepsisters surfboard tho it may be small
8/11/20, 4:23 PM - Parker: yeah i assumed so
8/11/20, 4:24 PM - Parker: i’d need a wetsuit though
8/11/20, 4:24 PM - Collin Hurst: Best move would be for me to get stuff for people
8/11/20, 4:24 PM - Collin Hurst: Sasha Liam and Rohan all have wetsuits so we could use theirs
8/11/20, 4:25 PM - Collin Hurst: Plus my friend cal had wavestorms so those combined would save probably 50$ a session lol
8/11/20, 4:25 PM - Collin Hurst: Has*
8/11/20, 4:25 PM - Parker: Oh dope
8/11/20, 5:08 PM - Ricky: It’s a longboard for sur
8/11/20, 6:19 PM - Matt Casali: Wetsuit rental was 15, and I'm pretty sure that's a flat rate
8/11/20, 6:20 PM - Matt Casali: Surfboard is around 30
8/11/20, 6:20 PM - Matt Casali: Also, which house should we go to after 3:30?
8/11/20, 6:54 PM - Collin Hurst: We can go to mine as long as we’re just in the backyard
8/11/20, 6:56 PM - Matt Casali: Good with me!
8/11/20, 6:56 PM - Matt Casali: I wanna see your children
8/11/20, 6:56 PM - Matt Casali: Aka weed

8/11/20, 6:56 PM - Collin Hurst: My favorite children
8/11/20, 6:58 PM - Matt Casali: Uncle Ben's mushrooms?
8/11/20, 6:58 PM - Collin Hurst: Ye
8/11/20, 7:57 PM - Ricky: A’s eat da poopoo
8/11/20, 8:04 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah wtf
8/11/20, 8:04 PM - Tim Ko: Fires sucks
8/11/20, 8:05 PM - Tim Ko: Plus he’s a weirdo irl
8/11/20, 8:05 PM - Tim Ko: My friend said that he knew some girl at Berkeley that got a DM from him
8/11/20, 8:05 PM - Tim Ko: Like he’s a 30 something yr old man wtf
8/11/20, 8:07 PM - Alex Starr: Not that big of an age gap haha
8/11/20, 8:07 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah that’s not that crazy
8/11/20, 8:07 PM - Alex Starr: Especially for celebrities.
8/11/20, 8:17 PM - Tim Ko: True
8/11/20, 8:17 PM - Tim Ko: But also fires is balding and looks like he’s in his mid 40s
8/11/20, 8:24 PM - Collin Hurst: So you think he’s weird cause of the way he looks
8/11/20, 8:25 PM - Ricky: Lmao damn Tim, don’t judge a book by its bald spots
8/11/20, 8:26 PM - Matt Casali: 30 yo hitting on a 20 yo is weird haha
8/11/20, 8:27 PM - Collin Hurst: Says you
8/11/20, 8:32 PM - Tim Ko: More like 35 hitting on a 18-19 yr olds
8/11/20, 8:34 PM - Tim Ko: Collin just likes em young Matt
8/11/20, 8:34 PM - Darren: 18 year old hitting up a 35+ year old is the move
8/11/20, 8:34 PM - Tim Ko: L m a o
8/11/20, 8:42 PM - Ricky: Big moves
8/11/20, 9:10 PM - Parker: That’s like that girl Ian got hit up by Etwuan Moore on the Pelicans lol
8/11/20, 9:10 PM - Parker: or however you spell it
8/11/20, 9:10 PM - Parker: i asked my stepsister she said a longboard is $30 for 2hrs or $50 for the day

8/11/20, 9:16 PM - Ricky: Dope!

8/11/20, 9:18 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah i should have definitely just brought my surfing stuff from home haha
8/11/20, 9:19 PM - Matt Casali: I'm just scared of the locals here 😧
8/11/20, 9:27 PM - Ricky: Like them stealing your stuff?
8/11/20, 10:33 PM - Matt Casali: No them just being mean while you surf haha
8/11/20, 10:33 PM - Matt Casali: Getting territorial
8/11/20, 10:36 PM - Collin Hurst: If you go to jacks or cowells they don’t care you’re a beginner lol
8/11/20, 10:37 PM - Ricky: Matt, if they mess with you well kick their dick off
8/11/20, 10:38 PM - Matt Casali: I've had people at pleasure point tell me to surf somewhere else haha
8/11/20, 10:39 PM - Matt Casali: But this is very reassuring thank you
8/11/20, 10:50 PM - Tim Ko: Damn
8/11/20, 10:50 PM - Tim Ko: Politely at least?
8/11/20, 10:53 PM - Matt Casali: Not really
8/11/20, 10:53 PM - Matt Casali: As politely as they can say "go surf somewhere else" I guess
8/11/20, 10:55 PM - Tim Ko: U should ask them why
8/11/20, 10:55 PM - Tim Ko: Next time
8/11/20, 10:55 PM - Collin Hurst: Jacks at pleasure point?
8/11/20, 10:58 PM - Matt Casali: Thats kinda the same thing right?
8/11/20, 11:21 PM - Ricky: Just to clarify
8/11/20, 11:21 PM - Ricky: Where we meeting tomorrow
8/11/20, 11:21 PM - Ricky: And at 9?

8/11/20, 11:24 PM - Matt Casali: We can meet at my place at 9 and take a look at cowells to see if there's any waves
8/11/20, 11:43 PM - Ricky: Can u send ur address?
8/11/20, 11:43 PM - Ricky: I know the genes area but just for when I’m almost there
8/11/20, 11:43 PM - Matt Casali: No prob no prob
8/11/20, 11:44 PM - Matt Casali: Its 1316 laurel street
8/12/20, 9:00 AM - Ricky: 4 min away
8/12/20, 9:00 AM - Matt Casali: Cool cool

8/12/20, 9:01 AM - Matt Casali: Hahaha
8/13/20, 1:15 PM - Ricky: anyone free in the area to drinks on graces lawn with her and her "gal pals"
8/13/20, 1:16 PM - Alex Starr: When?
8/13/20, 1:17 PM - Alex Starr: Although I can’t drink
8/13/20, 1:29 PM - Ricky: “Maybe like 5:30?” It’s more of a free flowing thing
8/13/20, 1:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: Wait this is not gonna overlap with our virtual hang and gang right
8/13/20, 1:34 PM - Ricky: no, it would be for like an hour prob
8/13/20, 1:34 PM - Ricky: time for people to go home and eat dinner with respective families
8/13/20, 1:34 PM - Ricky: just a nice evening socializing
8/13/20, 1:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: I can’t bc I’m going over to see hayleys uncle’s new baby but that’s sound fun and I’d be down in the future
8/13/20, 1:37 PM - Ricky: wow typical jason, pulling the old "gotta visit the uncles baby" trick
8/13/20, 1:43 PM - Collin Hurst: ^
8/13/20, 1:50 PM - Parker: i have a call at 5 otherwise i’d be down
8/13/20, 1:50 PM - Parker: next time they do it im down
8/13/20, 2:15 PM - Ricky: danggg all good all good
8/13/20, 2:17 PM - Vaughn: Daaamn thats a good one, take notes matt!
8/13/20, 2:18 PM - Matt Casali: Haha will do
8/13/20, 2:19 PM - Matt Casali: Just told them it was hard to concentrate in my house of 8 people and they were cool with jt
8/13/20, 3:04 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah I’d be down in the future as well, ideally when I’m off the medication that prevents me from drinking
8/13/20, 3:05 PM - Alex Starr: And can drive
8/13/20, 3:05 PM - Alex Starr: Fuck
8/13/20, 3:06 PM - Ricky: allllll good, we will absolutely do a more planned in advance one in the future
8/13/20, 3:06 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah the “fuck” was mostly at my situation.
8/13/20, 3:06 PM - Alex Starr: Looking like this may be a permanent thing
8/13/20, 3:07 PM - Alex Starr: Not the not driving, but my symptoms
8/13/20, 3:11 PM - Ricky: as in thats what your tests are turning back?
8/13/20, 3:11 PM - Ricky: will that mean the medication as well?
8/13/20, 3:12 PM - Alex Starr: Nah as in tests are all negative so we are getting into the diagnosis of exclusion territory and my symptoms match really well with something that is typically permanent.  Medication might not and very likely will not be permanent because I can decide whether it’s worth it haha.
8/13/20, 3:13 PM - Ricky: i see, dang
8/13/20, 3:13 PM - Ricky: sorry man :(
8/13/20, 3:15 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah I have an appointment on the 28th to hopefully get some kind of official diagnosis, but this is at least an extremely accurate description of my symptoms:
https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6205/cramp-fasciculation-syndrome#diseaseOverviewSection
8/13/20, 3:15 PM - Alex Starr: I wouldn’t describe it as like a full blown intense cramp, but definitely cramping
8/13/20, 3:18 PM - Ricky: damn, i see, so is this what it seems the diagnosis will be or something for reference?
8/13/20, 3:18 PM - Alex Starr: More for reference but it’s what I’d bet on
8/13/20, 3:18 PM - Ricky: "Some people with CFS improve without treatment"
8/13/20, 3:18 PM - Ricky: hope!
8/13/20, 3:18 PM - Alex Starr: Yep it’s rare and poorly understood
8/13/20, 3:18 PM - Ricky: looks like it
8/13/20, 3:18 PM - Alex Starr: But the improvement is too haha
8/13/20, 3:19 PM - Ricky: damn, also looks like that
8/13/20, 3:19 PM - Ricky: wtf is immunosuppressive therapy
8/13/20, 3:19 PM - Alex Starr: I’m kinda moving onto accepting and adapting to it rather than hoping for a fix
8/13/20, 3:19 PM - Alex Starr: They suppress your immune system so it doesn’t do as much.  I’ll be avoiding that unless I get way worse haha
8/13/20, 3:19 PM - Ricky: oh shit
8/13/20, 3:19 PM - Ricky: yeah taht sounds kinda sketch
8/13/20, 3:20 PM - Ricky: well, with a lil Starr gene elbow grease, you'l be back to healthy faster than any of these randos
8/13/20, 3:21 PM - Ricky: for real though, if ya ever need anything, you know where to come
8/13/20, 3:23 PM - Alex Starr: Thanks I appreciate it.
8/13/20, 3:23 PM - Ricky: and above all else, once this gawd damn Covid isn't preventing in person hangouts, the city of Palo Alto will be nothing but a reminder of the strength of Herd Ragers
8/13/20, 3:24 PM - Ricky: the city of Palo Alto will be nothing but a pile of rubble to remind people of Herd Ragers?
8/13/20, 3:24 PM - Ricky: idk i worded that weird
8/13/20, 3:25 PM - Alex Starr: I think it worked great both ways haha.  And I’m looking forward to it almost more than I would to getting better
8/13/20, 3:26 PM - Ricky: If you aren't physically 100% by than i know damn well we gon get you to 100% mentally
8/13/20, 3:27 PM - Ricky: especially with all the shit Collin's been growing haha
8/13/20, 3:27 PM - Alex Starr: That is one thing that has gotten much better.  I’d say I’m at 95% mentally.
8/13/20, 3:27 PM - Alex Starr: Haha
8/13/20, 3:32 PM - Ricky: ayyyy good to hear!! good thing you only need like 75% max to kick Stanfords PHD program in the dick hole
8/13/20, 3:32 PM - Ricky: the rest we gon dedicate to raging and finding you a powerful greek god wife
8/13/20, 3:32 PM - Matt Casali: *up the dick hole
8/13/20, 3:33 PM - Ricky: massssive dick hole? or tiny foot?

8/13/20, 3:44 PM - Alex Starr: Also Stanford will be undergrad free so plenty of room for outdoor events
8/13/20, 3:44 PM - Ricky: Wait what? Like as in there are so few undergrads?
8/13/20, 3:45 PM - Parker: Nah they’re online as of today
8/13/20, 3:45 PM - Alex Starr: Yup
8/13/20, 3:45 PM - Ricky: Oh shit!!!!
8/13/20, 3:46 PM - Ricky: Cya kiddos

8/13/20, 3:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: No but his weakness are not well known

8/13/20, 10:42 PM - Alex Starr: It’s going to be hot as fuck Saturday so we should hike accordingly
8/14/20, 1:44 AM - Parker: you guys wanna do Arastradero?
8/14/20, 8:01 AM - Alex Starr: I think we should consider Sunday, it’ll be 89 instead of 94
8/14/20, 8:17 AM - Tim Ko: I could come Sunday
8/14/20, 9:35 AM - Ricky: I can’t till 11 Sunday but am down then? Lol
8/14/20, 9:35 AM - Alex Starr: Hmmm better to do Saturday at 10 maybe heat wise.  11 things get rough
8/14/20, 9:35 AM - Alex Starr: Idk
8/14/20, 9:36 AM - Alex Starr: We will see what others say
8/14/20, 10:49 AM - Parker: im down either way my weather app says it’ll be cooler sunday too
8/14/20, 10:49 AM - Parker: usually doesn’t peak until later anyways
8/14/20, 10:49 AM - Parker: but it’ll be hot regardless
8/14/20, 10:52 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah
8/14/20, 11:08 AM - Darren: On one hand, I can't Sunday. On the other, Saturday sounds way too hot
8/14/20, 11:09 AM - Ricky: we aint hiking to relax just sayin
8/14/20, 11:09 AM - Darren: ?
8/14/20, 11:09 AM - Darren: How profound
8/14/20, 11:10 AM - Jason Greenberg: Pretty sure Hayley can’t make Sunday
8/14/20, 11:10 AM - Jason Greenberg: So saturday is better for us
8/14/20, 11:10 AM - Jason Greenberg: ^
8/14/20, 11:15 AM - Jason Greenberg: We could pick a shady hike
8/14/20, 11:16 AM - Parker: true
8/14/20, 11:16 AM - Tim Ko: What if we just walked in flat ground
8/14/20, 11:16 AM - Tim Ko: On
8/14/20, 11:25 AM - Ricky: I'm down for a more shady hike
8/14/20, 11:26 AM - Ricky: I feel like around rancho is flatter and more shaded
8/14/20, 11:26 AM - Ricky: like near dear hollow farm
8/14/20, 11:37 AM - Tim Ko: Gang I can make it tomorrow
8/14/20, 11:38 AM - Parker: yeah rancho is fairly shaded
8/14/20, 11:38 AM - Parker: arastradero not as much
8/14/20, 11:40 AM - Alex Starr: Saturday at rancho it is at 10
8/14/20, 11:51 AM - Alex Starr: But could someone send an address
8/14/20, 11:53 AM - Tim Ko: Gang
8/14/20, 11:55 AM - Darren: I can walk to deer hollow farm from my house, so I'll meet y'all there
8/14/20, 11:55 AM - Alex Starr: Address?
8/14/20, 11:55 AM - Darren: If it's not too hot
8/14/20, 12:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: K down
8/14/20, 12:03 PM - Ricky: Darren wanna just set an address not far from ur home?
8/14/20, 12:05 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah we could just meet at closest parking to darrens house
8/14/20, 12:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: Also I just wanna mention that past hikes have not been the _best_ social distancing wise so if we’re going with an especially big group this time let’s try to keep more apart if possible
8/14/20, 12:09 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah I was also a little leery of the group size
8/14/20, 12:21 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah for sure
8/14/20, 12:21 PM - Tim Ko: Also just letting y’all know I tested negative
8/14/20, 12:22 PM - Tim Ko: Since I work at clinic, thought it’d be good to know
8/14/20, 12:22 PM - Tim Ko: But yeah maybe we can do pairs and walk in front of each other
8/14/20, 12:23 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah I’ve tested negative quite a bit at this point but I don’t think we’re the major concern tbh
8/14/20, 12:47 PM - Vaughn: True true, also just got my negative result today, thanks for the swab tim!
8/14/20, 12:47 PM - Parker: Gnag
8/14/20, 12:48 PM - Alex Starr: And Darren quarantined hardcore so that’s at least 4 negatives
8/14/20, 12:48 PM - Alex Starr: But all should wear masks
8/14/20, 12:50 PM - Tim Ko: Yeee
8/14/20, 12:51 PM - Tim Ko: I hear 50% is close to the threshold to attain herd immunity
8/14/20, 12:51 PM - Alex Starr: That’s not how that works haha
8/14/20, 12:53 PM - Tim Ko: Isn’t it a big enough percentage gets immune and the spread of disease is much lower?
8/14/20, 12:53 PM - Matt Casali: I appreciate the pun though
8/14/20, 12:53 PM - Matt Casali: One more person and we're good
8/14/20, 12:53 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah but a negative test isn’t immunity.  It would only work if half of us had the disease and had recovered and then had immunity
8/14/20, 12:54 PM - Tim Ko: Oh yeah true
8/14/20, 12:54 PM - Collin Hurst: Hear me out, we all expose ourselves and get it and then quarantine together
8/14/20, 12:54 PM - Collin Hurst: Boom instant 2 week trip
8/14/20, 12:54 PM - Tim Ko: Throw a COVID party
8/14/20, 12:55 PM - Tim Ko: Ppl have died from that
8/14/20, 12:55 PM - Tim Ko: Also getting it doesn’t mean ur immune
8/14/20, 12:55 PM - Parker: all the cool kids are doing it
8/14/20, 1:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lol
8/14/20, 1:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’m not opposed to masks in a group that big
8/14/20, 2:09 PM - Ricky: why not test negative then all quarantine together haha
8/14/20, 2:30 PM - Tim Ko: I think the idea is that we become immune
8/14/20, 2:31 PM - Tim Ko: And Collin can tinder as much as he wants again
8/14/20, 2:36 PM - Ricky: ahhhhh gotcha
8/14/20, 2:43 PM - Darren: I don't think I'm gonna go on the hike tomorrow
8/14/20, 2:57 PM - Tim Ko: :(
8/14/20, 3:06 PM - Alex Starr: Work stuff?
8/14/20, 3:14 PM - Darren: Not wanting to wear a mask while going on a hot hike with over 10 people
8/14/20, 3:31 PM - Tim Ko: Cmon Darren, we want u there!
8/14/20, 5:39 PM - Collin Hurst: Amen
8/14/20, 5:52 PM - Tim Ko: From the physician I work with: having the antibodies means ur immune, it’s just a matter of how long. So far scientists are comparing covid to sars which has an immunation of 34 months. There hasn’t been any cases where a person fully recovered from COVID and got it again
8/14/20, 5:53 PM - Collin Hurst: Honestly getting it and recovering sounds like the move
8/14/20, 5:54 PM - Tim Ko: Yes, tho u would actually have to quarantine for 2 weeks, and have a slight chance of dying/lingering complications
8/14/20, 5:55 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah but full quarantine for two weeks or less quarantine for 50 weeks
8/14/20, 5:55 PM - Matt Casali: Full quarantine for two weeks sounds like ass
8/14/20, 5:55 PM - Matt Casali: I would rather everyone just socially distanced
8/14/20, 5:55 PM - Tim Ko: Plus the chance that u could have lingering complications
8/14/20, 5:55 PM - Matt Casali: ^
8/14/20, 5:56 PM - Tim Ko: But the majority of young ppl have no symptoms at all
8/14/20, 5:56 PM - Tim Ko: So for them it’s a free two weeks off and immunity for 30+ months
8/14/20, 5:57 PM - Tim Ko: Celine out here playing chess while we still playing checkers
8/14/20, 5:58 PM - Collin Hurst: You’d rather distance and semi quarantine for 50 weeks than full for 2? Damn
8/14/20, 6:00 PM - Darren: It wasn't that bad
8/14/20, 6:07 PM - Alex Starr: There’s also something called viral load.  So if you get a larger viral load initially, it massively increases your chances of having serious problems
8/14/20, 6:09 PM - Matt Casali: No I'm saying I'd rather have everyone quarantine for two weeks than do it by myself for two weeks with a fever
8/14/20, 6:10 PM - Collin Hurst: Oh well you know that’s not gonna happen lol
8/14/20, 6:11 PM - Parker: hahaha facts
8/14/20, 6:11 PM - Parker: this is the sketch part
8/14/20, 6:15 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah if you want to feel like I do, infect yourself
8/14/20, 6:18 PM - Parker: Can anyone confirm or deny that edgar Saadi works at Amici’s? im pretty sure i saw him inside lol
8/14/20, 6:18 PM - Parker: Who knew a drug lord needed a side hustle
8/14/20, 6:23 PM - Alex Starr: Maybe he bought it and launders money a la Walter white
8/14/20, 6:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: The complications are bad
8/14/20, 6:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lung scarring, heart problems
8/14/20, 6:28 PM - Ricky: I really doubt that because he posts stuff of him in LA in penthouse suites and driving million dollar cars everyday
8/14/20, 6:34 PM - Tim Ko: ^
8/14/20, 6:35 PM - Tim Ko: Honestly Collin u prob wouldn’t have any complications
8/14/20, 6:35 PM - Tim Ko: Ur healthy, active and fit individual
8/14/20, 6:35 PM - Tim Ko: And seems like he’s don’t have any history of medical conditions
8/14/20, 6:35 PM - Tim Ko: *you
8/14/20, 6:36 PM - Tim Ko: But I am in no way endorsing that u should get covid
8/14/20, 7:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: Strong advice
8/14/20, 7:36 PM - Parker: Rudy gobert came out about his lasting symptoms though three months later after he got it
8/14/20, 7:37 PM - Parker: True but does he live there? and those cars are 100% rented haha
8/14/20, 7:37 PM - Parker: I mean not like i’d know what he looks like bc i haven’t seen him in 4 years but i saw some dude working in Amici’s that looked just like him
8/14/20, 7:37 PM - Parker: a possibility
8/14/20, 7:42 PM - Ricky: Yeah rented but he still has been in LA for the past 6 months plus in a penthouse Suite that must be close to 3k a month in rent
8/14/20, 7:42 PM - Ricky: If not way more way
8/14/20, 7:42 PM - Parker: Ah ok probably not him then haha
8/14/20, 9:30 PM - Ricky: GANGGGGGGG
8/14/20, 9:35 PM - Tim Ko: Omg
8/14/20, 9:35 PM - Tim Ko: I totally forgot about the game lol
8/14/20, 9:35 PM - Tim Ko: Stopped watching after 4-0
8/14/20, 9:37 PM - Tim Ko: Damn of course we blow 2nd and 3rd with one out lol
8/14/20, 9:38 PM - Alex Starr: If Darren isn’t going, what address should we meet at?
8/14/20, 10:02 PM - Parker: Fucken piscotty
8/14/20, 10:11 PM - Tim Ko: Gang
8/14/20, 10:11 PM - Tim Ko: Big dubssssa
8/14/20, 10:12 PM - Ricky: BIG DUBBBSSSS
8/14/20, 10:12 PM - Tim Ko: Imagine if we were all at that game
8/14/20, 10:12 PM - Tim Ko: Would be insane
8/14/20, 10:12 PM - Ricky: We 100% woulda gone too
8/14/20, 10:12 PM - Ricky: Damnnnnnnnn
8/14/20, 10:13 PM - Ricky: If only
8/14/20, 11:34 PM - Tim Ko: ^

8/15/20, 12:02 AM - Ricky: If pple wanna go somewhere else they can suggest
8/15/20, 12:09 AM - Tim Ko: Let’s go for a place with very little elevation
8/15/20, 12:09 AM - Tim Ko: Like 10 ft max
8/15/20, 12:15 AM - Parker: Wtf that’s not a hike
8/15/20, 12:16 AM - Parker: i’d stroll through my neighborhood if that’s what i wanted to do

8/15/20, 8:41 AM - Jason Greenberg: That def happens to me

8/15/20, 8:41 AM - Jason Greenberg: Do you guys have a/c?

8/15/20, 8:42 AM - Ricky: Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeg game changer
8/15/20, 8:51 AM - Alex Starr: Hey guys there is a very real chance that I have to turn around on the hike just as an FYI
8/15/20, 8:52 AM - Ricky: Okay all good, we can try to stick to pats that look close to the parking lot
8/15/20, 9:19 AM - Alex Starr: Nah it’ll be fine

8/16/20, 4:25 AM - Collin Hurst: It’s 70 and raining over here at 4am lol
8/16/20, 5:38 AM - Darren: The frequency of lightning is ridiculous
8/16/20, 6:12 AM - Vaughn: Yeah wtf I was so confused. At first my brain didn't consider rain/thunder as an option cause of the heat today
8/16/20, 6:48 AM - Jason Greenberg: I heard it too and thought someone had dropped the biggest ice machine
8/16/20, 7:06 AM - Alex Starr: That’s what that was

8/16/20, 9:08 PM - Parker: Damn
8/17/20, 2:02 PM - Collin Hurst: Do you guys remember in elementary school when we would say the pledge of allegiance before class? Weird times
8/17/20, 2:03 PM - Ricky: I pledge allegiance to the flag, of the united states of america, and to the republic, for which it stands, one nation, under god, indivisible, with liberty, and justice for all (amen pre like 3rd grade)
8/17/20, 2:18 PM - Matt Casali: Oh wow they even got the amen in
8/17/20, 2:18 PM - Matt Casali: Passing through redding thoughts
8/17/20, 4:34 PM - Tim Ko: If I could go back In time, I’d go back just so I could kneel during the pledge of allegiance every day
