5/10/17, 12:33 PM - Matt Casali: https://redshift.autodesk.com/minecraft-architecture/
5/10/17, 12:34 PM - Matt Casali: Architecture kind of counts as a science
5/10/17, 12:34 PM - Vaughn: Oh so you and Lorenzo are architects now
5/10/17, 12:34 PM - Matt Casali: Basically
5/10/17, 12:34 PM - Matt Casali: But the article is still really cool
5/10/17, 12:34 PM - Matt Casali: It's turned into a design tool
5/10/17, 1:08 PM - Alex Starr: Architecture is not science rofl
5/10/17, 1:08 PM - Matt Casali: if you're not rofl i will fucking kill you
5/10/17, 1:08 PM - Alex Starr: I'm not
5/10/17, 1:09 PM - Alex Starr: Bring it
5/10/17, 1:09 PM - Matt Casali: bye boi
5/10/17, 1:09 PM - Matt Casali: okay true but it's tied very closely to a science
5/10/17, 1:09 PM - Alex Starr: In that engineers are occasionally involved?
5/10/17, 1:10 PM - Matt Casali: without structural engineering, architecture can't even be a thing
5/10/17, 1:10 PM - Alex Starr: Tell that to people building huts in Africa
5/10/17, 1:11 PM - Alex Starr: Bitch
5/10/17, 1:14 PM - Parker: Tell that the teepee mofos
5/10/17, 1:14 PM - Parker: bitch
5/10/17, 1:15 PM - Matt Casali: that requires some structural engineering
5/10/17, 1:15 PM - Matt Casali: bitch
5/10/17, 1:15 PM - Alex Starr: Only in the loosest sense
5/10/17, 1:15 PM - Alex Starr: And no math is involved
5/10/17, 1:15 PM - Alex Starr: Whore
5/10/17, 1:16 PM - Parker: U cuck
5/10/17, 1:19 PM - Matt Casali: I can't keep this up, I don't have the self esteem for it
5/10/17, 1:22 PM - Parker: Soft
5/10/17, 1:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: You can do it Matt
5/10/17, 2:06 PM - Alex Starr: Nah bitch

5/10/17, 2:08 PM - Vaughn: You're as weak as your erections matt
5/10/17, 2:09 PM - Alex Starr: Hopefully he won't be as short lived
5/10/17, 2:11 PM - Matt Casali: Hopefully I will

5/16/17, 1:55 PM - Vaughn: Farting while clothed will not contaminate a sterile environment
5/16/17, 2:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: This is gold
5/16/17, 2:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: üéñ
5/16/17, 2:21 PM - Parker: Lol
5/16/17, 2:33 PM - Alex Starr: I'm still not gonna fart into the fume hood
5/16/17, 2:34 PM - Alex Starr: Will admit to being sorely tempted
5/16/17, 2:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
5/20/17, 9:47 PM - Jason Greenberg: <Media omitted>
5/20/17, 9:47 PM - Jason Greenberg: Just a correlation
5/20/17, 9:48 PM - Alex Starr: It's not much of a jump tho
5/20/17, 9:48 PM - Alex Starr: 94->104
5/20/17, 9:48 PM - Alex Starr: I guess that's significant?
5/20/17, 9:48 PM - Parker: Yeahhhh
5/20/17, 9:48 PM - Parker: I was a huge baby
5/20/17, 9:49 PM - Parker: So gang
5/20/17, 9:49 PM - Alex Starr: am*
5/20/17, 9:49 PM - Parker: üñïüèº*
5/20/17, 9:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha
5/24/17, 10:17 AM - Matt Casali: There's a star called tabbys star that has been periodically dimming and it's dimming again. I just thought it was interesting because some scientists have proposed that it could be caused by Dyson spheres or other megastructures
5/24/17, 10:25 AM - Alex Starr: That would be sick
5/24/17, 10:25 AM - Alex Starr: They need to hook us up
5/24/17, 10:33 AM - Matt Casali: Haha yeah, I haven't actually seen any articles on whether we have the technology, resources or money to build something like that
5/24/17, 10:37 AM - Alex Starr: We do not
5/24/17, 10:37 AM - Alex Starr: It could also be ringworld which would be dope
5/24/17, 10:49 AM - Matt Casali: That would be awesome
5/24/17, 10:49 AM - Alex Starr: Have u read ringworld?
5/24/17, 10:51 AM - Matt Casali: No but I imagined a world in the shape of a ring around the sun, which would be cool
5/24/17, 10:52 AM - Alex Starr: That is the basis of it yes
5/24/17, 10:53 AM - Alex Starr: They're good books
5/24/17, 10:53 AM - Alex Starr: Weird but good
5/24/17, 10:55 AM - Matt Casali: What else are they about?
5/24/17, 10:56 AM - Alex Starr: Kinda hard to explain
5/24/17, 10:56 AM - Alex Starr: Basically they discover ringworld
5/24/17, 10:57 AM - Alex Starr: And a puppeteer (three legged herbivore with hyper advanced tech) a human (Louis wu) and a sentient carnivore head on over to investigate and uncover a whole bunch of both pleasant and nasty stuff
5/25/17, 3:46 PM - Vaughn: What do you call a frenchman wearing sandals?
5/25/17, 3:47 PM - Vaughn: Phillipe Phillope
5/25/17, 3:48 PM - Parker: Lol

6/1/17, 9:06 AM - Alex Starr: US expected to pull out of Paris accords this week
6/1/17, 9:26 AM - Jason Greenberg: Expected? I read they were considering it
6/1/17, 9:28 AM - Alex Starr: Just read that it's looking like a pull out
6/1/17, 9:29 AM - Tim Ko: But can they pull out faster than parker did when he destroyed that man's car with his Subaru ü§î
6/1/17, 9:33 AM - Alex Starr: He pulled out so slowly
6/1/17, 9:39 AM - Parker: the opposite of pulling out is what I needed to do
6/1/17, 9:40 AM - Parker: Do u mean the Paris climate shit? Cuz I thought that was a done deal
6/1/17, 9:41 AM - Tim Ko: That makes it even more impressive that parker pulled out slowly and still managed to hit the car üòÇ
6/1/17, 9:41 AM - Parker: And tim he had like a scratch lol u weren't there
6/1/17, 9:41 AM - Parker: My car was far more destroyed
6/1/17, 9:41 AM - Tim Ko: Ok...just a small scratch huh? Lol
6/1/17, 9:42 AM - Parker: To the guys car? Yeah...
6/1/17, 9:42 AM - Jason Greenberg: The one that everyone in the UN agreed to yeah
6/1/17, 9:42 AM - Jason Greenberg: Well not Syria
6/1/17, 9:42 AM - Jason Greenberg: And some other guy
6/1/17, 9:43 AM - Jason Greenberg: Namibia?
6/1/17, 9:43 AM - Jason Greenberg: But yeah it was looking solid
6/1/17, 9:46 AM - Parker: Hmm I heard it was already approved like a week ago
6/1/17, 9:46 AM - Parker: Either way we're fucked
6/1/17, 10:09 AM - Alex Starr: It ain't looking good
6/1/17, 11:41 AM - Ricky: Guys
6/1/17, 11:41 AM - Ricky: Would anyone want the suicide squad poster?
6/1/17, 11:42 AM - Ricky: Rn Walgreens has a 40% off sale on prints for the next 2 days for Memorial Day!!!!
6/1/17, 11:42 AM - Ricky: Only problem is photo on facebook is too low quality to make a good poster
6/1/17, 11:42 AM - Ricky: So I asked Darren to send me higher resolution one
6/1/17, 11:57 AM - Jason Greenberg: What are the size options
6/1/17, 11:57 AM - Jason Greenberg: Lol Walgreens
6/1/17, 11:58 AM - Vaughn: I want one
6/1/17, 11:58 AM - Vaughn: Very badly

6/1/17, 1:34 PM - Parker: with this shit they're not the leader
6/1/17, 1:35 PM - Parker: They're the laughing stock
6/1/17, 1:35 PM - Parker: They're the worlds leading dumbfuck
6/1/17, 1:35 PM - Alex Starr: This is really depressing
6/1/17, 1:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh no
6/1/17, 1:42 PM - Alex Starr: The death knell
6/1/17, 1:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: Elon left his advisory board
6/1/17, 1:45 PM - Alex Starr: And I've given up hope
6/1/17, 1:45 PM - Alex Starr: Eat whatever/do whatever guys
6/1/17, 1:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: No don't do that we still have state government
6/1/17, 1:46 PM - Vaughn: You can fix this alex
6/1/17, 1:46 PM - Vaughn: You can be the change we need
6/1/17, 1:46 PM - Alex Starr: We're fucked
6/1/17, 1:46 PM - Alex Starr: No I can't
6/1/17, 1:46 PM - Vaughn: Oh fuck
6/1/17, 1:46 PM - Vaughn: Not even alex can fix this
6/1/17, 1:46 PM - Alex Starr: Rapidly approaching the point where no one can
6/1/17, 1:47 PM - Jason Greenberg: Matt put down that slice of cheese you picked up
6/1/17, 1:47 PM - Jason Greenberg: You're still vegan
6/1/17, 1:47 PM - Parker: _and in that very moment, that's when we knew we were fucked_
6/1/17, 1:47 PM - Parker: Fuck vegan people
6/1/17, 1:48 PM - Parker: We had to make vegan cookies for our bake sale and they were gross
6/1/17, 1:48 PM - Parker: And expensive
6/1/17, 1:50 PM - Alex Starr: Hey don't say fuck vegan people
6/1/17, 1:50 PM - Alex Starr: They can do whatever the fuck they want
6/1/17, 1:50 PM - Parker: No they can't
6/1/17, 1:50 PM - Parker: Fuck them
6/1/17, 1:52 PM - Vaughn: In other news, caught a record breaking bass in texas using a McNugget as bait
6/1/17, 1:52 PM - Vaughn: *a couple caught
6/1/17, 1:52 PM - Alex Starr: Still screwed
6/2/17, 6:07 PM - Alex Starr: Maybe I should learn French and move there
6/2/17, 6:07 PM - Alex Starr: Macron basically invited us
6/2/17, 6:08 PM - Matt Casali: But then you would have to live in France
6/2/17, 6:08 PM - Matt Casali: And speak french
6/2/17, 6:08 PM - Alex Starr: France
6/2/17, 6:08 PM - Matt Casali: Gross
6/2/17, 6:08 PM - Alex Starr: Is nice
6/2/17, 6:08 PM - Matt Casali: Gross
6/2/17, 6:08 PM - Alex Starr: Have u seen our president?
6/2/17, 6:09 PM - Alex Starr: He looks like a tub of lard hate fucked the annoying orange
6/2/17, 6:09 PM - Matt Casali: But at least you live in a nice part of the world
6/2/17, 6:09 PM - Alex Starr: And France isn't?
6/2/17, 6:09 PM - Alex Starr: France and Germany are dope
6/2/17, 6:09 PM - Matt Casali: Germany would be awesome
6/2/17, 6:09 PM - Alex Starr: Racist
6/2/17, 6:09 PM - Matt Casali: And I'm kidding France would probably be cool
6/2/17, 6:09 PM - Matt Casali: Countryside
6/2/17, 6:10 PM - Alex Starr: Haha yeah I think it would
6/2/17, 6:10 PM - Alex Starr: Or city
6/2/17, 6:10 PM - Matt Casali: Eat baguettes all day
6/2/17, 6:10 PM - Alex Starr: Nah I'm straight
6/2/17, 6:10 PM - Parker: Eat baguettes drink wine and wear berets all day
6/2/17, 6:10 PM - Parker: That's the life
6/2/17, 6:10 PM - Alex Starr: Minus the hats
6/2/17, 6:11 PM - Parker: Yeah but wine cheese and bread
6/2/17, 6:11 PM - Alex Starr: Guys I think we should have some trump looks like jokes at some point
6/2/17, 6:11 PM - Parker: üí¶üí¶üò©üî•
6/2/17, 6:11 PM - Alex Starr: I will spend about 90 minutes in the Paris airport
6/2/17, 6:11 PM - Parker: Don't get bombed
6/2/17, 6:11 PM - Parker: Hey I did the same thing
6/2/17, 6:11 PM - Matt Casali: You're asking too much Parker
6/2/17, 6:11 PM - Parker: Ur right
6/2/17, 6:12 PM - Alex Starr: I'll do my best parker
6/2/17, 6:12 PM - Alex Starr: I am the bomb
7/12/17, 3:09 PM - Parker: https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/07/12/health/fda-novartis-leukemia-gene-medicine.html?referer=http://m.facebook.com
7/12/17, 3:11 PM - Matt Casali: Nice
7/12/17, 3:13 PM - Tim Ko: Interesting
7/12/17, 3:14 PM - Tim Ko: Seems hopeful for those with acute leukemia
7/12/17, 3:20 PM - Parker: Yeah
7/12/17, 3:21 PM - Parker: ALL baby
7/12/17, 3:21 PM - Parker: And ACl
7/26/17, 8:29 PM - Tim Ko left
8/2/17, 1:01 PM - Matt Casali: I saw this on the BBC and thought you should see it:

Human embryos edited to stop disease - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-40802147
8/2/17, 1:02 PM - Alex Starr: Yup its finally starting
8/2/17, 1:02 PM - Alex Starr: GATTACA here we come
8/2/17, 1:02 PM - Matt Casali: Not sure what that means but this step is exciting
8/2/17, 1:02 PM - Alex Starr: U ever seen gattaca?
8/2/17, 1:03 PM - Matt Casali: Nope
8/2/17, 1:03 PM - Alex Starr: If the answer is nope, you've made an error
8/2/17, 1:03 PM - Alex Starr: Basically engineered people take over
8/2/17, 1:03 PM - Alex Starr: But it's borderline impossible for us to do that so it won't happen
8/2/17, 1:03 PM - Matt Casali: Change that to engineer and you got silicon valley
8/2/17, 1:04 PM - Alex Starr: Not nearly as cool
8/2/17, 1:05 PM - Matt Casali: I feel like it would have a detrimental impact on natural selection and evolution
8/2/17, 1:06 PM - Matt Casali: But maybe nor
8/2/17, 1:06 PM - Alex Starr: What natural selection?
8/2/17, 1:06 PM - Matt Casali: Because for this heart disease the correct genes are being passed down
8/2/17, 1:06 PM - Parker: Gattaca is dope
8/2/17, 1:06 PM - Alex Starr: We quit that shit a while ago
8/2/17, 1:06 PM - Parker: @darren
8/2/17, 1:06 PM - Alex Starr: Ya matt whys that matter?
8/2/17, 1:07 PM - Alex Starr: Also we don't do natural selection anymore
8/2/17, 1:08 PM - Alex Starr: Natural selection today is called eugenics
8/2/17, 1:12 PM - Matt Casali: Whats the difference?
8/2/17, 1:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: It says it only works with at least one healthy parent
8/2/17, 1:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: And that because crispr didn't cause it by inserting a gene, unjustified designer babies are even less of a possibility rn
8/2/17, 1:59 PM - Alex Starr: I mean that's just a matter of time til they are good enough at it
8/2/17, 1:59 PM - Alex Starr: I mean I don't think we could figure out how to confer intelligence to someone
8/2/17, 2:00 PM - Alex Starr: Too many genes need a larger sample size
8/2/17, 2:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: Seems like it was an accident
8/2/17, 2:00 PM - Alex Starr: ?
8/25/17, 5:17 PM - Ricky: What everyone doing?
8/25/17, 5:17 PM - Ricky: I wanna swing bye and say ily
8/25/17, 5:19 PM - Parker: Jason's tonight!! I think
8/25/17, 5:20 PM - Parker: He hasn't confirmed
8/25/17, 5:33 PM - Matt Casali: Thatd be fun
8/25/17, 5:33 PM - Matt Casali: I could try to convince fred to come and not fall asleep instead
10/3/17, 7:46 AM - Matt Casali: You guys see the vue glasses?
10/3/17, 7:59 AM - Alex Starr: Nope
10/3/17, 8:52 AM - Parker: No
10/3/17, 9:33 AM - Matt Casali: Theyre smart glasses
10/3/17, 9:33 AM - Matt Casali: Basically like my watch but i  glasses form
10/3/17, 9:37 AM - Vaughn: These are gunna be a hit
10/3/17, 9:38 AM - Vaughn: Damn look at us, charging our phones, watches, books, glasses
10/3/17, 9:39 AM - Vaughn: Freakin sick
10/3/17, 9:39 AM - Alex Starr: Why do people own watches?
10/3/17, 9:41 AM - Matt Casali: Smart watches?
10/3/17, 9:41 AM - Vaughn: Nah just watches
10/3/17, 9:41 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah we've been through it before but
10/3/17, 9:42 AM - Parker: Mainly for fashion nowadays
10/3/17, 9:42 AM - Parker: non smart watches that is
10/3/17, 9:42 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah
10/3/17, 9:42 AM - Vaughn: I could never get used to wearing a watch
10/3/17, 9:42 AM - Matt Casali: I own a cheap casio watch for surfing
10/3/17, 9:42 AM - Vaughn: Either too tight or too loose
10/3/17, 9:44 AM - Vaughn: If my arm moves a little of the watch grazes something it just reminds me im wearing it
10/3/17, 9:46 AM - Vaughn: Only makes sense for exercise and business, maybe casinos
10/3/17, 9:47 AM - Alex Starr: And what do u use smart watches for
10/3/17, 9:47 AM - Alex Starr: Like when could I not just casually use my phones
10/3/17, 9:47 AM - Alex Starr: Phone*
10/3/17, 9:49 AM - Tim Ko: I own an A's watch
10/3/17, 9:50 AM - Matt Casali: Working out its super helpful
10/3/17, 9:52 AM - Matt Casali: Basically a shortcut for your phone in all other cases
10/3/17, 9:52 AM - Matt Casali: And fashion
10/3/17, 9:53 AM - Alex Starr: What does it record when u work out?
10/3/17, 9:53 AM - Alex Starr: And there we go that's the main reason I think (the last one)
10/3/17, 9:56 AM - Matt Casali: Heart rate, calories burned (based off heartrate, steps and body info), steps, time. It sends info to your phone so you can create or observe progress in your routine.
10/3/17, 9:56 AM - Matt Casali: It also has useful widgets that I use
10/3/17, 9:57 AM - Matt Casali: If you're phone's plugged in you can change music settings from afar
10/3/17, 9:57 AM - Matt Casali: Mine is also useful on hikes cause you can check altitude and pressure if you need it
10/3/17, 9:59 AM - Alex Starr: I wonder how accurate that stuff is.  Like is it backcalculating altitude from pressure it perceives or using satellites and minor gravitational changes to calculate altitude first
10/3/17, 10:00 AM - Parker: my bluetooth workout earbuds died and it made me sad
10/3/17, 10:01 AM - Matt Casali: Im guessing satellite
10/3/17, 10:02 AM - Matt Casali: It wasnt _that_ expensive
10/3/17, 10:02 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah probably satellite
10/3/17, 10:47 AM - Jason Greenberg: I like steps, miles and heart rate
10/3/17, 10:47 AM - Jason Greenberg: And music control is dope cuz you don't have to take out your phone
10/3/17, 10:48 AM - Alex Starr: Lol
10/3/17, 11:28 AM - Ricky: I mostly use it to see what you guys are talking about while in class
10/3/17, 11:28 AM - Ricky: So I don't gotta take out my phone and completely disrespect my prof
10/3/17, 11:28 AM - Ricky: Also they can be used for scuba diving
10/3/17, 11:28 AM - Ricky: Pretty important
10/3/17, 11:29 AM - Ricky: Death by suffocation under 60ft of water doesn't sound fun
10/3/17, 11:29 AM - Parker: That's what happened to Phil Knights son
10/3/17, 11:30 AM - Parker: and now our bball arena is named after him
10/3/17, 11:32 AM - Alex Starr: Haha ricky I just go with the disrespect
10/3/17, 12:44 PM - Tim Ko: Rip bob knight
10/3/17, 12:48 PM - Alex Starr: Nah dude he'd be bored if he rested in peace.  Heaven for the atmosphere, hell for the people.
10/3/17, 12:54 PM - Alex Starr: U guys see that McDonalds is for one day bringing back the szechuan sauce back for one day?
10/3/17, 1:02 PM - Parker: For one day twice?
10/3/17, 1:02 PM - Parker: wouldn't that make two days
10/3/17, 1:04 PM - Alex Starr: No
10/3/17, 1:05 PM - Alex Starr: For one chicken strip, I got enough Szechuan sauce for one chicken strip.
10/3/17, 1:05 PM - Alex Starr: It's redundant but not additive
10/3/17, 1:22 PM - Parker: Issa joke mane
10/3/17, 1:22 PM - Alex Starr: I was joking too
10/3/17, 1:35 PM - Vaughn: Youre a joke
10/3/17, 1:35 PM - Alex Starr: Right?
10/3/17, 7:15 PM - Matt Casali: Alex Starr may I conduct an interview with your mother or father?
10/3/17, 7:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: _said Matt, twisting the silver band in his coat pocket_
10/3/17, 7:50 PM - Matt Casali: Hahahaha
10/3/17, 8:29 PM - Vaughn: Mrs. Starr, would you say you are "proud" of your son?
10/3/17, 8:48 PM - Alex Starr: Wait what matt
10/3/17, 8:48 PM - Alex Starr: What about
10/3/17, 8:48 PM - Alex Starr: And for what
10/3/17, 8:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: He gonna marry your dad and adopt you
10/3/17, 8:52 PM - Alex Starr: I'd disown his ass
10/3/17, 8:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: I'm only mad because he thought if it first
10/3/17, 8:53 PM - Alex Starr: But actually matt why lol. Parenting advice?
10/3/17, 8:53 PM - Alex Starr: Or more of a what not to do situation
10/3/17, 8:54 PM - Alex Starr: Or is it about your fredi situation.  After all, my dad waited a year in grad school for my mom.
10/3/17, 8:55 PM - Alex Starr: Or just why Dune is fucking amazing
10/3/17, 9:11 PM - Parker: If u know u know
10/3/17, 9:20 PM - Ricky: I don't know :(
10/3/17, 9:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: Dunno
10/3/17, 9:22 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh I think maybe it's like sexual
10/3/17, 9:22 PM - Jason Greenberg: Like virginity yoke
10/3/17, 9:22 PM - Parker: Barry is a player
10/3/17, 9:31 PM - Matt Casali: No haha I need to interview electric car owners for entrepreneurship class
10/3/17, 9:31 PM - Alex Starr: Lol go for it.  Though my dad technically leases it
10/4/17, 12:39 AM - Ricky: I'm a Prius owner
10/4/17, 12:39 AM - Ricky: I can give u a half interview
10/17/17, 12:42 PM - Matt Casali: The concept of Entropy is cool
10/17/17, 12:42 PM - Matt Casali: Also, ricky can I actually interview you this weekend?
10/17/17, 12:43 PM - Alex Starr: What r u learning about entropy
10/17/17, 12:43 PM - Matt Casali: Just started learning about it
10/17/17, 12:43 PM - Matt Casali: Learned that its a state variable
10/17/17, 12:43 PM - Alex Starr: I suppose with no chemistry it would be later
10/17/17, 12:44 PM - Matt Casali: Change is independent of path
10/17/17, 12:44 PM - Matt Casali: What do you mean?
10/17/17, 12:44 PM - Alex Starr: Idk we did entropy first semester freshman year and in Chem honors haha
10/17/17, 12:44 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah I havent learned about it yet haha
10/17/17, 12:44 PM - Alex Starr: So it struck me as weird that it was now that entropy was cool
10/17/17, 12:44 PM - Matt Casali: Maybe a tiny bit in regular chem
10/17/17, 12:45 PM - Alex Starr: Ya we beat the shit out of it in physics/Chem so far
10/17/17, 12:45 PM - Matt Casali: But I dont remember shit from that class
10/17/17, 12:45 PM - Matt Casali: Hows E&M going?
10/17/17, 12:46 PM - Alex Starr: Midterm was easy but I majorly fucked up one question which was annoying.  We are just finishing up magnetism and moving into waves where I have much more experience
10/17/17, 12:48 PM - Alex Starr: Derived snell's law in discussion which was a pain for calculus reasons
10/17/17, 1:12 PM - Matt Casali: Ohhh thats fun
10/17/17, 1:13 PM - Alex Starr: Kind of
10/17/17, 1:13 PM - Alex Starr: It was set up so we had about a 4 line solution for the derivative which of course just led to n1sintheta1=n2sintheta2
10/17/17, 1:39 PM - Alex Starr: Weirdest intro to waves.  Solved an LC circuit as a parallel for some reason @16507995462
10/17/17, 1:41 PM - Matt Casali: As a parallel what
10/17/17, 1:41 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz it oscillates like an electromagnetic wave I guess
10/17/17, 1:42 PM - Alex Starr: Or the fields in the vicinity do
10/17/17, 1:42 PM - Alex Starr: I'm on 5 hrs of sleep so it's not sticking well but I think that's it
10/17/17, 1:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh that sucks
10/17/17, 1:44 PM - Alex Starr: Getting the right kind of cells is really hard
10/17/17, 1:44 PM - Alex Starr: U have to keep taking measurements to be sure u get them just right so u can freeze a whole bunch to use
10/17/17, 1:45 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah its hard for me to follow
10/17/17, 1:46 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz it oscillates like a spring due to the inductor and charged capacitor so creates oscillating electromagnetic fields that look like photon waves from far away
10/17/17, 1:47 PM - Matt Casali: That makes sense
10/17/17, 3:17 PM - Alex Starr: Just learned about a common ochem principle called "back side attack" haha
10/17/17, 3:19 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha
10/17/17, 3:19 PM - Alex Starr: It makes me laugh literally every time
10/17/17, 3:20 PM - Alex Starr: "And when we finish here with backside attack"
10/17/17, 3:44 PM - Ricky: YEEEE
10/17/17, 3:45 PM - Matt Casali: NOICE
10/25/17, 6:51 PM - Matt Casali: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/unistellar/evscope-100-times-more-powerful-than-a-classical-t/description
10/25/17, 6:51 PM - Matt Casali: This is cool but I cant find a price
10/25/17, 6:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: Your mom and dad can afford it
10/25/17, 6:59 PM - Matt Casali: How do you know this
10/25/17, 6:59 PM - Parker: walked into that in
10/25/17, 7:00 PM - Parker: one*
10/25/17, 7:01 PM - Vaughn: Looks like its $2000
10/25/17, 7:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: Is your birthday coming up?
10/25/17, 7:06 PM - Matt Casali: Shit
10/25/17, 7:07 PM - Matt Casali: Feb 28th
10/25/17, 7:07 PM - Matt Casali: So kind of?
10/25/17, 7:43 PM - Vaughn: Ask santa hes pretty generous to kids like you
10/25/17, 7:48 PM - Matt Casali: Okay
10/25/17, 7:48 PM - Matt Casali: I'll try not to be offended by that
10/25/17, 7:50 PM - Vaughn: Was that not the vibe? I was just riding with jason
10/25/17, 7:55 PM - Matt Casali: Jasons didnt seem as harsh
10/25/17, 8:12 PM - Parker: Lol
10/26/17, 10:56 AM - Matt Casali: https://youtu.be/ty33v7UYYbw
What Alex listened to as a child most likely
10/26/17, 10:58 AM - Alex Starr: Well no
10/26/17, 10:58 AM - Alex Starr: I mostly just learned about dinosaurs
10/26/17, 10:59 AM - Matt Casali: I found that on a radio based off of ocean man
10/26/17, 11:00 AM - Matt Casali: Dinosaurs are sick
10/26/17, 11:01 AM - Matt Casali: I would take the class here if it would do anything for my academic progress
10/26/17, 11:01 AM - Alex Starr: 4 year old me knew more about dinosaurs than I currently do
10/26/17, 11:02 AM - Matt Casali: I think it's the same for a lot of us
10/26/17, 11:03 AM - Matt Casali: I had a dream I was double majoring with linguistics last night
10/26/17, 11:04 AM - Matt Casali: Just so ya know
10/26/17, 11:05 AM - Alex Starr: Weird move
10/26/17, 11:05 AM - Alex Starr: R u doubling at all?
10/26/17, 11:09 AM - Matt Casali: No, but I think I may want to
10/26/17, 11:09 AM - Alex Starr: In what
10/26/17, 11:10 AM - Parker: German!!!
10/26/17, 2:10 PM - Matt Casali: Linguistics
10/26/17, 2:10 PM - Matt Casali: Just looked it up and I have no space though
10/26/17, 2:11 PM - Alex Starr: How can that be true
10/26/17, 2:11 PM - Alex Starr: You have no class 3 days per week
10/26/17, 2:11 PM - Matt Casali: I also realized that I missed the coolest opportunity to take honors physics here
10/26/17, 2:11 PM - Matt Casali: Limit most of the time is to 3 classes per quarter
10/26/17, 2:12 PM - Matt Casali: Plus I got research
10/26/17, 2:12 PM - Matt Casali: And I should be doing more work for that than I am currently
10/26/17, 2:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: How do you have no class 3 days a week?
10/26/17, 2:18 PM - Matt Casali: I have a long day on Tuesday and thursday
10/26/17, 2:18 PM - Matt Casali: It just worked out that way
10/26/17, 2:19 PM - Parker: that‚Äôs crazy it lined up like that
10/26/17, 2:19 PM - Parker: i‚Äôve never found anything close
10/26/17, 2:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: Can i see your schedule?
10/26/17, 2:21 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
10/26/17, 2:23 PM - Parker: That‚Äôs ass
10/26/17, 2:23 PM - Alex Starr: It's the lack of labs
10/26/17, 2:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: Three classes
10/26/17, 2:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: ?
10/26/17, 2:24 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah
10/26/17, 2:24 PM - Matt Casali: I'm not very busy
10/26/17, 2:24 PM - Matt Casali: Like with homework I mean
10/26/17, 2:25 PM - Matt Casali: But the fact that I didn't take a fourth class while classes were easier made me not able to go for another major
10/26/17, 2:25 PM - Matt Casali: Is there not standard at sb?
10/26/17, 2:27 PM - Matt Casali: *three
10/26/17, 2:27 PM - Alex Starr: For us 3-4 is standard
10/26/17, 2:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: 3-4 but I thought everyone took 4
10/26/17, 2:27 PM - Parker: 4 for us
10/26/17, 2:27 PM - Parker: 3-4 i guess
10/26/17, 2:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Semester is different tho
10/26/17, 2:28 PM - Parker: 3 would our u behind though
10/26/17, 2:28 PM - Parker: Yeah cal is wack
10/26/17, 2:28 PM - Parker: put*
10/26/17, 2:28 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah if I had taken 4 every quarter I'd graduate middle of next year
10/26/17, 2:28 PM - Parker: daaaaang
10/26/17, 2:28 PM - Alex Starr: Wait then how can u not double major
10/26/17, 2:29 PM - Alex Starr: I'm only doing 4 (except for labs so 5 in some) per semester and can double (barely)
10/26/17, 2:30 PM - Alex Starr: It'd be a lot of work but it's not an impossibility
10/26/17, 2:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: Whaaaat
10/26/17, 2:30 PM - Parker: Semester is different
10/26/17, 2:31 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
10/26/17, 2:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: I'm doubling and its prob gonna take me an extra quarter to graduate
10/26/17, 2:31 PM - Alex Starr: I mean I have around 25 hours of class per semester
10/26/17, 2:31 PM - Alex Starr: So it's not a cakewalk
10/26/17, 2:31 PM - Matt Casali: I added just the 4 basic classes for linguistics and filled it up
10/26/17, 2:31 PM - Matt Casali: Thats wrong
10/26/17, 2:32 PM - Alex Starr: What's wrong
10/26/17, 2:32 PM - Matt Casali: I could do a minor
10/26/17, 2:32 PM - Matt Casali: Thats the plan for a minor
10/26/17, 2:32 PM - Alex Starr: Is 5 classes a quarter a non-option?
10/26/17, 2:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: Are you letters and sciences matt?
10/26/17, 2:33 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah I'm pretty sure you can't do that
10/26/17, 2:33 PM - Alex Starr: I think u can
10/26/17, 2:33 PM - Matt Casali: I think that's a ucsb thing jason
10/26/17, 2:33 PM - Alex Starr: It's just hard
10/26/17, 2:33 PM - Parker: That‚Äôd be insane haha
10/26/17, 2:33 PM - Matt Casali: ^
10/26/17, 2:33 PM - Parker: 16 credits is already a lot
10/26/17, 2:34 PM - Matt Casali: Remember that would be 25 credits for me
10/26/17, 2:34 PM - Alex Starr: What
10/26/17, 2:34 PM - Alex Starr: U guys get 5 credits per class?
10/26/17, 2:34 PM - Matt Casali: 5 credits per course
10/26/17, 2:34 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah
10/26/17, 2:34 PM - Parker: Whaaaat
10/26/17, 2:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: Wait whats the credit limit per quarter there
10/26/17, 2:34 PM - Matt Casali: Sometimes less depending on the class
10/26/17, 2:34 PM - Alex Starr: That can't be right
10/26/17, 2:34 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz u need 180 to graduate
10/26/17, 2:34 PM - Matt Casali: 19 I think
10/26/17, 2:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: So your three is 15 credits?
10/26/17, 2:34 PM - Matt Casali: Not sure actually
10/26/17, 2:35 PM - Parker: We need 180 to graduate and a regular class is 4
10/26/17, 2:35 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz for me, I'll have 5 classes in two semesters and be at 20 units
10/26/17, 2:35 PM - Parker: 15 per quarter is average
10/26/17, 2:35 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah 5*3*12 = 180
10/26/17, 2:35 PM - Alex Starr: Which'll be a little nuts
10/26/17, 2:35 PM - Matt Casali: Same for us parker
10/26/17, 2:36 PM - Matt Casali: You guys just take more classes
10/26/17, 2:36 PM - Parker: Ours is 4*4 so it‚Äôs a little above average
10/26/17, 2:36 PM - Parker: but they also have 1-2 credit classes
10/26/17, 2:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: I'm taking 5 rn
10/26/17, 2:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah those lil guys
10/26/17, 2:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: And they have 3 unit classes
10/26/17, 2:36 PM - Matt Casali: How many credits jason?
10/26/17, 2:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: 20
10/26/17, 2:37 PM - Matt Casali: Okay
10/26/17, 2:37 PM - Matt Casali: I took four last quarter and had 19
10/26/17, 2:37 PM - Alex Starr: Which 5?
10/26/17, 2:37 PM - Alex Starr: @16502079920
10/26/17, 2:37 PM - Matt Casali: Nevermind I took 5 And had 19
10/26/17, 2:37 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah that makes more sense matt
10/26/17, 2:37 PM - Matt Casali: So it's just little guys
10/26/17, 2:37 PM - Alex Starr: Double is hard but doable
10/26/17, 2:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: Econ, Stats for econ, Chem 1a, language and power, psy 99 research
10/26/17, 2:37 PM - Matt Casali: Not with full classes no
10/26/17, 2:38 PM - Matt Casali: Unless I do 5 classes a quarter for two quarters
10/26/17, 2:38 PM - Alex Starr: Oh psy 99 doesn't count haha
10/26/17, 2:38 PM - Matt Casali: Or unless it's a flimsy ass major
10/26/17, 2:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha I have to write a paper tho
10/26/17, 2:38 PM - Alex Starr: I mean it's a lot of hours but for some reason it doesn't count in my brain
10/26/17, 2:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: It's a little different
10/26/17, 2:39 PM - Alex Starr: Like I'm in the lab 8-12 hours and do additional stuff outside but just think of it as an add on
10/26/17, 2:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: You took 8-12 months to be born and your parents don't exactly call you an "add-on"
10/26/17, 2:40 PM - Alex Starr: My bearing has no bearing on this conversation haha
10/26/17, 2:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ahahaha
10/26/17, 2:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: _Hey do you know if your add-on is gonna be a boy or girl?_
10/26/17, 2:42 PM - Alex Starr: But yeah jason is there any lap for your double?
10/26/17, 2:42 PM - Alex Starr: Overlap
10/26/17, 2:49 PM - Parker: Lol
10/26/17, 3:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: I only have to do GEs for the BA which is nice
10/26/17, 3:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: And math 34a was in both majors
10/26/17, 3:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: We're flyin
10/26/17, 3:05 PM - Alex Starr: Nice yeah I only need my breadth for letters and sciences generally but no overlap between applied math and molecular biology haha
10/26/17, 3:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: Is that what you decided on?
10/26/17, 3:18 PM - Alex Starr: Ya I'm making my applied math CS emphasis so I have to take a couple CS classes lower div that don't really help toward the major
10/26/17, 3:18 PM - Alex Starr: But then I take CS 188, 189, and C191 (what I'm
leaning towards) and those count toward math major
10/26/17, 3:18 PM - Parker: i need to figure out what concentration i want
10/26/17, 3:20 PM - Alex Starr: What options do u have
10/26/17, 3:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: That'll be dopee
10/26/17, 3:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: You'll be simulating emotions in no time
10/26/17, 3:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: Here comes a strong majority android for the herd
10/26/17, 3:44 PM - Alex Starr: Haha cold
10/26/17, 4:01 PM - Parker: Finance, accounting, marketing, OBA, sports business
10/26/17, 4:01 PM - Parker: i forget if there are others
10/26/17, 4:08 PM - Alex Starr: What's oba
10/26/17, 4:08 PM - Alex Starr: A knockoff Greek restaurant?
10/26/17, 4:08 PM - Parker: operational business analytics or something i think
10/26/17, 4:08 PM - Parker: Idk what that is haha
10/26/17, 4:09 PM - Alex Starr: Well that rules one out
10/26/17, 4:09 PM - Parker: yeah haha i can see maybe marketing but i haven‚Äôt taken any marketing classes so idk
10/26/17, 4:09 PM - Parker: finance and accounting are popular
10/26/17, 4:10 PM - Parker: sports business is always an option but it limits myself more
10/26/17, 4:17 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah and u could probably transition that way later if push came to shove
10/26/17, 4:29 PM - Parker: Yeah well mostly because i can always go into sports eith a marketing/finance/accounting degree but not necessarily the other way around
10/26/17, 4:30 PM - Alex Starr: Yup
10/26/17, 4:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: Finance is dumb
10/26/17, 4:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: Accounting is dumb
10/26/17, 4:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: Sports is cool
10/26/17, 4:52 PM - Alex Starr: Oh damn did not expect that from Jason
10/26/17, 4:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: What's OBA?
10/26/17, 4:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: Banks suck
10/26/17, 4:52 PM - Alex Starr: Business analytics
10/26/17, 4:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ah
10/26/17, 4:52 PM - Alex Starr: Or a knockoff Greek restaurant
10/26/17, 4:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: Omg
10/26/17, 4:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oba is cool
10/26/17, 4:53 PM - Alex Starr: And opa! Is delicious
10/26/17, 4:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: Didn't you say you wanted to do sports management?
10/26/17, 4:53 PM - Alex Starr: Sounds mathy
10/26/17, 4:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: Opa has very solid hummus
10/26/17, 4:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: Sounds psychy actually
10/26/17, 4:54 PM - Alex Starr: Their lemon chicken orzo was great
10/26/17, 4:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ohhh
10/26/17, 4:54 PM - Alex Starr: There's usually a follow up
10/26/17, 4:55 PM - Parker: can confirm
10/26/17, 4:55 PM - Parker: Yeah i did jason but that‚Äôs just the sports aspect of it haha
10/26/17, 4:56 PM - Parker: I just need to take more classes to figure it out
10/26/17, 4:56 PM - Alex Starr: Good call
10/26/17, 4:56 PM - Parker: If i like marketing i might do that
10/26/17, 4:56 PM - Parker: I might be running for vp of marketing in akpsi so that could line up well
10/26/17, 4:56 PM - Alex Starr: Nice
10/26/17, 4:56 PM - Alex Starr: What do u do in the position?
10/26/17, 4:58 PM - Parker: I met with the guy who‚Äôs currently in the position today to talk about it. Main duties are running the social media, advertising during rush, and maintaining the website(which no one really does rn cuz it‚Äôs time consuming)
10/26/17, 4:58 PM - Parker: Basically just make sure as many people know about akpsi as possible
10/26/17, 4:59 PM - Alex Starr: Hence the snaps of "rush akpsi"?
10/26/17, 4:59 PM - Parker: and you have a committee that u can delegate things to cuz it‚Äôs a lot if it‚Äôs just u lol
10/26/17, 4:59 PM - Parker: Yee i‚Äôm already prepares
10/26/17, 4:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: If you're into marketing watch Mad Men
10/26/17, 5:00 PM - Alex Starr: Or buy expensive scotch one of the two
10/26/17, 5:00 PM - Alex Starr: Jason u worked out what ur plan is with the double?
10/26/17, 5:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah I'm gonna take all my classes haha
10/26/17, 5:00 PM - Alex Starr: And then see where u stand?
10/26/17, 5:00 PM - Parker: Yeah i‚Äôve wanted to watch it for awhile
10/26/17, 5:01 PM - Alex Starr: I wasn't a big fan
10/26/17, 5:01 PM - Parker: No cigarettes tho
10/26/17, 5:01 PM - Alex Starr: Good call
10/26/17, 5:01 PM - Parker: I‚Äôve seen bits from my dad watching it
10/26/17, 5:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: It's a high tension show
10/26/17, 5:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: Very casual high tension
10/26/17, 5:02 PM - Jason Greenberg: Grad school hopefully Alex
10/26/17, 5:02 PM - Alex Starr: For which one? Or a combo?
10/26/17, 5:02 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lol
10/26/17, 5:02 PM - Alex Starr: Do u pay for psych grad school or so they pay u?
10/26/17, 5:02 PM - Jason Greenberg: I'm leaning pscyh
10/26/17, 5:02 PM - Alex Starr: Do not so
10/26/17, 5:02 PM - Jason Greenberg: They pay you for phd
10/26/17, 5:02 PM - Alex Starr: Nice
10/26/17, 5:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hopefully I wouldn't masters out
10/26/17, 5:03 PM - Alex Starr: Why would u?
10/26/17, 5:03 PM - Parker: You‚Äôre doing a phd jason??
10/26/17, 5:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hopefully
10/26/17, 5:03 PM - Parker: Daaaamn
10/26/17, 5:03 PM - Alex Starr: It's a good call
10/26/17, 5:03 PM - Alex Starr: U get payed way more later
10/26/17, 5:03 PM - Parker: mucha escuela
10/26/17, 5:04 PM - Parker: Indeed
10/26/17, 5:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: I mean some people masters out. The grad students I've talked to say you figure it out in the first year or two if it's right for you
10/26/17, 5:04 PM - Alex Starr: That's good
10/26/17, 5:04 PM - Alex Starr: Phd is the way to go
10/26/17, 5:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: If I'm lucky I'll have a real job by the time I'm in my 30s
10/26/17, 5:11 PM - Alex Starr: Gotta to do it to accrue enough skill and knowledge to be relevant
10/26/17, 5:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: ^
10/26/17, 5:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: Unless ur an engineer or something else immediately relevant
10/26/17, 5:12 PM - Alex Starr: Even then
10/26/17, 5:12 PM - Alex Starr: It's iffy
10/26/17, 5:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: Coding is so immediately useful
10/26/17, 5:12 PM - Alex Starr: Not necessarily immediately relevant
10/26/17, 5:13 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ok
10/26/17, 5:16 PM - Alex Starr: Like it's definitely useful but for super advanced stuff u need phd
10/26/17, 5:18 PM - Alex Starr: Difference is I guess u can get that training via another source
10/26/17, 5:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: Tru
11/7/17, 10:05 AM - Alex Starr: Matt did u hear that some physicists and archaeologists used muon detectors to discover a 100ft long void in the Great Pyramid?
11/7/17, 10:28 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah it's super cool
11/7/17, 10:29 AM - Matt Casali: Cool application of particle  physics
11/7/17, 10:30 AM - Alex Starr: The archaeological implications are super cool imo
11/7/17, 10:32 AM - Jason Greenberg: It would have been fun to be an early British archeologist
11/7/17, 10:32 AM - Jason Greenberg: Just blast through ancient shit and check it out inside
11/7/17, 10:33 AM - Alex Starr: Um
11/7/17, 10:33 AM - Jason Greenberg: _Yo Mark there's fucking gold just sitting in this one!_
11/7/17, 10:33 AM - Alex Starr: No?
11/7/17, 10:37 AM - Matt Casali: Jason's sex life
11/7/17, 10:51 AM - Jason Greenberg: Ohhhhhh
11/7/17, 10:51 AM - Jason Greenberg: Shit that's really good haha
11/7/17, 10:52 AM - Matt Casali: Haha thanks
11/7/17, 11:12 AM - Parker: Hahaha
11/18/17, 12:55 PM - Alex Starr: Matt can u explain spin to me?
11/18/17, 12:59 PM - Alex Starr: Like how can a massless photon have an intrinsic angular momentum?
11/18/17, 1:01 PM - Matt Casali: Things without mass can have momentum
11/18/17, 1:01 PM - Alex Starr: Because quantum momentum is defined differently?
11/18/17, 1:01 PM - Matt Casali: Relativistic momentum
11/18/17, 1:01 PM - Matt Casali: Full definition
11/18/17, 1:02 PM - Alex Starr: Ah ok
11/18/17, 1:02 PM - Alex Starr: Well everything else adds up then
11/18/17, 1:02 PM - Alex Starr: And I guess there‚Äôs no answer as to why the angular momentum works like that
11/18/17, 1:55 PM - Matt Casali: Works like what exactly?
11/18/17, 3:17 PM - Alex Starr: Why it‚Äôs a thing
11/18/17, 3:17 PM - Alex Starr: Why do all particles except the Higgs boson have a spin?
11/18/17, 3:17 PM - Alex Starr: An intrinsic angular momentum
11/18/17, 6:22 PM - Matt Casali: Makes more sense than them not having one haha
11/18/17, 6:22 PM - Matt Casali: Other than that I dont know
11/18/17, 6:22 PM - Alex Starr: What what
11/18/17, 6:22 PM - Alex Starr: Wait what
11/18/17, 6:23 PM - Alex Starr: Why does it make more sense
11/18/17, 6:37 PM - Matt Casali: Think about it on a larger scale
11/18/17, 6:38 PM - Matt Casali: It's much more common for a sun to spin then not
11/18/17, 6:38 PM - Matt Casali: But ur right
11/18/17, 6:38 PM - Matt Casali: It may not translate
11/18/17, 7:23 PM - Matt Casali: I have a good book that you could read that explains these things pretty well in Layman's terms
11/18/17, 8:30 PM - Alex Starr: I feel like I‚Äôve got a layman‚Äôs understanding
11/18/17, 9:42 PM - Parker: jake layman?
11/30/17, 2:11 PM - Alex Starr: So, partially, suck my dick
^
11/30/17, 2:11 PM - Alex Starr left
12/8/17, 12:44 PM - Matt Casali: Can someone add Alex back? I need to ask him a question haha
12/8/17, 1:01 PM - Jason Greenberg added Alex Starr
2/2/18, 10:35 AM - Matt Casali: Sprawling Mayan network discovered under Guatemala jungle - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-42916261
2/2/18, 10:35 AM - Matt Casali: Cool application of technology/ also cool for what it means about Mayan culture
2/3/18, 8:00 AM - Matt Casali: Another article 
Deepfakes porn has serious consequences - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42912529
2/3/18, 12:17 PM - Alex Starr: I‚Äôm caught between thinking that tech is so damn cool and that is potentially extremely damaging
2/3/18, 1:09 PM - Matt Casali: Same here
2/6/18, 2:01 PM - Matt Casali: Falcon Heavy launch and landing
2/6/18, 3:15 PM - Vaughn: Thee future is now. You can watch porn of dillion harper with seth macfarlones face!
2/6/18, 4:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Link please
2/6/18, 4:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Or its fake news
2/6/18, 6:04 PM - Vaughn: https://www.erome.com/i/PeRAX23b
2/6/18, 6:04 PM - Matt Casali: :/
2/6/18, 6:08 PM - Vaughn: not your cup of tea?
2/6/18, 6:21 PM - Tim Ko: ‰∏∫‰ªÄ‰πà
2/6/18, 6:26 PM - Ricky: my professor is teaching our whole calss that human impact on the environment doesnt even matter
2/6/18, 6:27 PM - Tim Ko: Hahaha
2/6/18, 6:28 PM - Tim Ko: @16507145032
2/6/18, 6:28 PM - Ricky: its less than a rounding error
2/6/18, 6:36 PM - Matt Casali: What type of human impact?
2/6/18, 6:41 PM - Ricky: enviromental
2/6/18, 6:41 PM - Ricky: lol
2/6/18, 6:41 PM - Ricky: he was like "the volcanoes and animal flatulence do so much more, when we produce more than is just a rounding error then ill get mother natures email"
2/6/18, 7:17 PM - Alex Starr: Your professor is a massive cunt
2/6/18, 7:18 PM - Tim Ko: What‚Äôs his name rick
2/6/18, 8:10 PM - Ricky: he is
2/6/18, 8:10 PM - Ricky: he really is
2/6/18, 8:10 PM - Ricky: Scott Anderson
2/6/18, 8:10 PM - Ricky: an old as turtle man white guy
2/6/18, 8:13 PM - Parker: hahaha
3/20/18, 1:12 PM - Matt Casali: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjtOGPJ0URM this is interesting
3/20/18, 1:13 PM - Alex Starr: New rule
3/20/18, 1:14 PM - Alex Starr: U have to give a quick summary of the damn link
3/20/18, 1:14 PM - Matt Casali: why give a summary when you can just watch the video haha
3/20/18, 1:14 PM - Parker: ^
3/20/18, 1:15 PM - Alex Starr: Idk if I‚Äôve seen it before or if it is interesting etc.
3/20/18, 1:16 PM - Parker: Watch to find out
3/20/18, 1:16 PM - Alex Starr: Will u?
3/20/18, 1:17 PM - Parker: The last one didnt load for me but I will later when i have time
3/20/18, 1:26 PM - Alex Starr: Ok reactions to the video:
3/20/18, 1:27 PM - Alex Starr: It did not adequately address future filters ((think like dark forest theory (thanks Darren))
3/20/18, 1:27 PM - Alex Starr: Also failed to consider possibility that the whole filter thing is bullshit
3/20/18, 1:27 PM - Matt Casali: If you look up fermi paradox by the same guy it gives a broader explanation
3/20/18, 1:28 PM - Alex Starr: Of...?
3/20/18, 1:29 PM - Matt Casali: of the great filter
3/20/18, 1:32 PM - Alex Starr: It‚Äôs not falsifiable tho
3/20/18, 1:32 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah that's true, but it's interesting to consider
3/20/18, 1:34 PM - Alex Starr: Seems like one of quite a few interpretations tho
3/20/18, 1:35 PM - Jason Greenberg: I like da aminations
5/10/18, 6:13 PM - Matt Casali: Alex I need some livestock --> climate change data sources plz
5/10/18, 6:13 PM - Alex Starr: There aren‚Äôt really a lot of great ones
5/10/18, 6:14 PM - Matt Casali: I found a fairly good one for cornell
5/10/18, 6:14 PM - Alex Starr: Link me
5/10/18, 6:15 PM - Matt Casali: But there was some type of paper that you quoted talking about being vegan vs. eating only poultry and those products
5/10/18, 6:15 PM - Alex Starr: I did
5/10/18, 6:15 PM - Alex Starr: But there seems to be quite a bit of disagreement about specifics
5/10/18, 6:15 PM - Matt Casali: http://news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat
5/10/18, 6:16 PM - Matt Casali: I think it's old
9/17/18, 12:52 PM - Matt Casali: http://www.jnmjournal.org/journal/view.html?doi=10.5056/jnm16018
9/17/18, 12:52 PM - Matt Casali: sauerkraut here i come
9/17/18, 12:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: I think this was recently falsified
9/17/18, 12:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: Like this month
9/17/18, 12:56 PM - Matt Casali: oh fuck really?
9/17/18, 12:56 PM - Matt Casali: can you post the link to the falsification?
9/17/18, 12:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/06/will-probiotics-ever-live-up-to-the-hype/562301/

Yeah i remembered reading something about it
9/17/18, 12:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: Tldr is that they just go out the other end
9/17/18, 12:58 PM - Matt Casali: hmm
9/17/18, 12:59 PM - Matt Casali: what about the study in india though?
9/17/18, 12:59 PM - Matt Casali: like did the probiotics still help?
9/17/18, 1:00 PM - Matt Casali: I'm mainly thinking about introducing more probiotics because of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Ftj5E90tY
9/17/18, 1:00 PM - Matt Casali: basically saying that 90% of seratonin in your body is produced by your gut because of the bacteria
9/17/18, 1:00 PM - Matt Casali: and you want to stimulate their growth
9/17/18, 1:21 PM - Alex Starr: It‚Äôs really really fucking complicated
9/17/18, 1:26 PM - Alex Starr: So effects are going to be pretty minimal
9/17/18, 1:29 PM - Alex Starr: Ur tossing one or two types of bacteria at this whole mess
9/17/18, 1:31 PM - Matt Casali: I understand that
9/17/18, 1:31 PM - Matt Casali: But the 90% thing definitely pushes me to do the best I can to foster the health of bacteria in my stomach
9/17/18, 1:34 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah but they don‚Äôt say how much it varies do they?
9/17/18, 1:34 PM - Alex Starr: 100% of my blood is produced in bone marrow, but it‚Äôs insanely hard to change how much I‚Äôm making
9/17/18, 1:37 PM - Matt Casali: Idk, definitely something I need to see
9/17/18, 1:44 PM - Alex Starr: Also, what data is their on the ‚Äúproper‚Äù amount of serotonin?
9/17/18, 1:46 PM - Alex Starr: Could u potentially screw up ur gut with probiotics and over/under produce?
9/17/18, 2:42 PM - Alex Starr: That being said I‚Äôm no expert
9/19/18, 1:00 PM - Alex Starr: Apparently, the microbes evolved to alter out behavior so that we would eat certain foods that would allow them to proliferate
9/19/18, 1:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: fuck
9/19/18, 1:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: just when you thought you had free will
9/19/18, 1:01 PM - Alex Starr: But also, there‚Äôre quite a few sensory neurons in our gut and they may have evolved to allow the bacteria to alter more
9/19/18, 1:02 PM - Alex Starr: It‚Äôs all pretty new but growing evidence and all, it‚Äôs very cool
9/19/18, 1:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: why allow the bacteria to alter more?
9/19/18, 1:04 PM - Alex Starr: Fuck if I know
9/19/18, 1:04 PM - Alex Starr: Maybe they are nutritionally competent
9/19/18, 1:04 PM - Alex Starr: Could just be drift
9/19/18, 1:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: maybe fuck yourself
9/19/18, 1:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: -the departed
9/19/18, 1:05 PM - Alex Starr: I‚Äôm more meant that I don‚Äôt think researchers know very well why
9/19/18, 1:06 PM - Alex Starr: Or if it‚Äôs even why the neurons are there
9/19/18, 1:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: ah
9/19/18, 1:06 PM - Alex Starr: It‚Äôs poorly understood
11/26/18, 10:14 AM - Alex Starr: https://apnews.com/4997bb7aa36c45449b488e19ac83e86d
11/26/18, 10:16 AM - Tim Ko: Damn that‚Äôs pretty neat
11/26/18, 10:18 AM - Alex Starr: It‚Äôs been massively condemned
11/26/18, 10:25 AM - Alex Starr: He also fucked up
11/26/18, 10:27 AM - Alex Starr: But it‚Äôs obviously a big deal if true
11/26/18, 10:33 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah but ethics is not china‚Äôs strong suit
11/26/18, 10:33 AM - Alex Starr: It‚Äôs a pretty important suit to have tho haha
11/26/18, 10:34 AM - Alex Starr: But I think a bigger issue is that he didn‚Äôt even get all the cells, so the child won‚Äôt even be very HIV resistant
11/26/18, 10:35 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah I know hahaha
11/26/18, 10:36 AM - Tim Ko: Like there is more than one way HIV can enter right?
11/26/18, 10:36 AM - Tim Ko: Cuz article says he only disabled one protein
11/26/18, 10:37 AM - Alex Starr: Nope issue is he didn‚Äôt get all the cells
11/26/18, 10:37 AM - Alex Starr: CCR5 mutation makes you really HIV resistant
11/26/18, 10:38 AM - Alex Starr: But not if half your cells don‚Äôt have it
11/26/18, 10:41 AM - Tim Ko: Ohhh I see
11/26/18, 10:42 AM - Alex Starr: So the benefits are very questionable and it exposes the kids to risk of offtarget (unintended) mutations that could harm them
11/26/18, 10:42 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah definately haha
11/26/18, 10:43 AM - Tim Ko: Anytime u mess with genes u don‚Äôt know what else u could affect
11/26/18, 10:43 AM - Tim Ko: But nonetheless, this is somewhat of an advancement
11/26/18, 10:43 AM - Alex Starr: Kind of
11/26/18, 10:43 AM - Alex Starr: We knew we could do this
11/26/18, 10:44 AM - Alex Starr: It‚Äôs more of a should situation
11/26/18, 10:44 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah but he showed u could do it in humans
11/26/18, 10:44 AM - Alex Starr: Fetuses have been edited before tho
11/26/18, 10:44 AM - Tim Ko: Oh I see
11/26/18, 10:44 AM - Alex Starr: And unedited fetuses have been inserted
11/26/18, 10:45 AM - Alex Starr: This is just the first time an edited fetus has been inserted into a human
11/26/18, 10:45 AM - Alex Starr: It would‚Äôve been a lot more meaningful if he had been more successful or had shown there were no off target effects
11/26/18, 10:46 AM - Tim Ko: I see
11/26/18, 10:47 AM - Tim Ko: I just find it comical that in China u can do whatever the hell u want lmao
11/26/18, 10:47 AM - Vaughn: What genes did they edit?
11/26/18, 10:47 AM - Vaughn: Eye color or something?
11/26/18, 10:47 AM - Alex Starr: CCR5
11/26/18, 10:47 AM - Alex Starr: Which if mutated, makes you extremely HIV resistant
11/26/18, 10:48 AM - Jason Greenberg: They do eye color in the US i believe
11/26/18, 10:49 AM - Alex Starr: Lol what
11/26/18, 10:49 AM - Alex Starr: We don‚Äôt even understand eye color well enough to edit it if we wanted too
11/26/18, 10:50 AM - Alex Starr: Currently, the best predictions are about 85% accurate in guessing whether eyes are light or dark (not even color) from genetic sequence alone
11/26/18, 11:10 AM - Jason Greenberg: Idk i just listened to a wsj podcast that seemed to state that
11/26/18, 11:10 AM - Jason Greenberg: I can link it
11/26/18, 11:55 AM - Alex Starr: State that we are editing germ line cells for eye color?
11/26/18, 11:57 AM - Jason Greenberg: Screening
11/26/18, 11:57 AM - Jason Greenberg: My b
11/26/18, 1:03 PM - Alex Starr: Ya u could screen but again it‚Äôs not super accurate
11/26/18, 1:09 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz 85% is only somewhat better than a coin flip
11/26/18, 1:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: I have 10 babies, 8 have red eyes and we're in business
11/26/18, 1:59 PM - Ricky: Loollll
12/1/18, 7:56 PM - Alex Starr: Just learned about this really weird thing called chromothripsis, basically for one chromosome explodes and is stitched back together in a random order with chunks missing, it‚Äôs present in 2-3% of cancers
1/4/19, 5:19 PM - Tim Ko: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/urban-survival/201502/the-surprising-psychology-the-common-cold
1/4/19, 5:20 PM - Tim Ko: Interesting since lately I‚Äôve noticed that when I‚Äôm sick my mental health is affected too
1/4/19, 5:30 PM - Ricky: No for real my brain sucks when I‚Äôm sick
1/4/19, 5:32 PM - Tim Ko: Mmm I thought it was just me hahaha
1/4/19, 5:46 PM - Alex Starr: Plus loss of sleep fucks with you which can compound when I‚Äôll
1/4/19, 5:46 PM - Alex Starr: Ill
1/4/19, 5:57 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah my sleep lately has been pretty bad
1/4/19, 6:00 PM - Ricky: Damn, too much PS4?
1/4/19, 7:21 PM - Tim Ko: Lol nah I think it‚Äôs cuz I‚Äôm sick
1/29/19, 8:59 PM - Alex Starr: An Israeli team just announced they‚Äôll have cured cancer within the year
1/29/19, 8:59 PM - Alex Starr: https://apple.news/A62ntApKJQ5azr_7ldkIC6Q
1/29/19, 9:00 PM - Matt Casali: Sounds nice
1/29/19, 9:00 PM - Alex Starr: It could be legit
1/29/19, 9:01 PM - Alex Starr: Their approach seems like it has potential
1/29/19, 9:01 PM - Alex Starr: And even if it falls massively short, it still could be huge
1/29/19, 9:07 PM - Alex Starr: But it‚Äôs fairly irresponsible to announce shit like that all the same
1/29/19, 10:22 PM - Jason Greenberg: I read it but realized I‚Äôm in over my head on viability
1/29/19, 10:27 PM - Alex Starr: If it works it works
1/29/19, 10:27 PM - Alex Starr: But I doubt it‚Äôll work
1/29/19, 11:09 PM - Tim Ko: Sounds interesting
1/29/19, 11:10 PM - Tim Ko: The thing is u gotta kill every single cell
1/29/19, 11:10 PM - Vaughn: True
1/29/19, 11:11 PM - Vaughn: If you kill the person you kill the cancer
1/29/19, 11:11 PM - Parker: facts
1/29/19, 11:13 PM - Tim Ko: Lol that is correct
1/29/19, 11:14 PM - Tim Ko: That‚Äôs why removing shit plus a shit load of chemotherapy is the preference if possible
1/31/19, 8:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: Dude biology is insane
1/31/19, 8:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: Just the scale of things
1/31/19, 8:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: Reviewing neuron types and I can‚Äôt wrap my head around how many connections there are as obvious and cliche as that is
1/31/19, 8:45 PM - Matt Casali: No it's super cool
1/31/19, 8:49 PM - Alex Starr: It‚Äôs an absolute mess
1/31/19, 8:51 PM - Alex Starr: Math/physics/chemistry have all this beautiful symmetry/formulas and biology no one has a clue
1/31/19, 9:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hahah
1/31/19, 9:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah chemistry is super orderly which is weird
1/31/19, 9:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: Just in terms of relating to the natural world
1/31/19, 9:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: Or whatever it is
1/31/19, 9:54 PM - Alex Starr: If shit gets complex/complicated enough ur hosed
3/1/19, 2:52 PM - Matt Casali: Worked with liquid helium today
3/1/19, 2:53 PM - Matt Casali: It turns into a super-conductor at really cold temperatures and its super cool cause it essentially transmits heat like a sound wave
3/1/19, 2:54 PM - Alex Starr: Now we just need one at room temperature
3/1/19, 2:58 PM - Matt Casali: Would be pretty cool
3/1/19, 3:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: Wow
3/1/19, 3:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: I‚Äôve watched a video about that very cool
3/1/19, 3:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: Did you touch it tho?
3/1/19, 3:00 PM - Matt Casali: Hahaha no
3/1/19, 3:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: Shame
3/1/19, 3:00 PM - Matt Casali: I think it was at something like 4 K
3/1/19, 3:01 PM - Alex Starr: That‚Äôs the one
3/1/19, 3:01 PM - Alex Starr: Remember from chemistry haha
3/1/19, 3:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: I‚Äôve heard that the first person to touch it will win that self-experimentation prize
3/1/19, 3:02 PM - Jason Greenberg: Same as the guy who cracked only the knuckles of his left hand for his whole life
3/1/19, 3:05 PM - Matt Casali: What happened with him?
3/1/19, 3:05 PM - Alex Starr: He fucked up one hand
3/1/19, 3:05 PM - Alex Starr: Same as if you touch liquid helium
3/1/19, 8:36 PM - Matt Casali: Someone explain liquor before beer never been sicker, beer before liquor your in the clear plz
3/1/19, 8:36 PM - Matt Casali: I want to know the biology
3/1/19, 8:36 PM - Matt Casali: The biology facts
3/1/19, 8:38 PM - Alex Starr: It is not a thing
3/1/19, 8:38 PM - Alex Starr: Except that you tend to drink more once buzzed, so if u get buzzed then hit hard liquor, you‚Äôll get seriously fucked up
3/1/19, 8:40 PM - Matt Casali: Oh wait its reverse
3/1/19, 8:41 PM - Alex Starr: Yes it is
3/1/19, 8:41 PM - Alex Starr: And that‚Äôs what I explained so it still holds
3/1/19, 8:43 PM - Matt Casali: Ye yeet
3/1/19, 8:43 PM - Matt Casali: Thx
3/1/19, 11:06 PM - Ricky: You got these reversed bud
3/1/19, 11:07 PM - Ricky: Man, I should really just read the chat before I respond to stuff haah
3/1/19, 11:08 PM - Matt Casali: Hahaha
3/1/19, 11:08 PM - Matt Casali: Its okay
3/1/19, 11:08 PM - Matt Casali: Love ya bud
3/1/19, 11:09 PM - Ricky: Love you bud
3/1/19, 11:09 PM - Ricky: You getting lit?
3/1/19, 11:18 PM - Matt Casali: Yeee
3/2/19, 12:24 AM - Matt Casali: Danced a ton, had drinks with my future housemates, played a lot of smash
3/2/19, 12:24 AM - Matt Casali: Good birthday if ya ask me
3/2/19, 12:32 AM - Vaughn: The weekend just staryed boyo
3/2/19, 12:33 AM - Vaughn: We celebrating for 2 more days
3/2/19, 12:33 AM - Matt Casali: :)))))))))
3/2/19, 12:51 AM - Tim Ko: Gang gang
3/2/19, 10:12 AM - Parker: gang gang
3/6/19, 3:59 PM - Parker: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/health/aids-cure-london-patient.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur
3/6/19, 4:04 PM - Matt Casali: Ye yeet
3/6/19, 4:15 PM - Alex Starr: HIV: hold my beer let me beat this level
3/6/19, 4:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: Read that it‚Äôs cool
3/12/19, 12:35 PM - Tim Ko: Did u know that there are no pain receptors in the brain
3/12/19, 12:36 PM - Tim Ko: So sometimes brain surgery is done with the person awake
3/12/19, 12:44 PM - Matt Casali: I had no idea
3/12/19, 12:44 PM - Matt Casali: That's so weeeeirrrrd
3/12/19, 12:44 PM - Parker: Damn that‚Äôs crazy
3/12/19, 12:44 PM - Parker: i would not wanna do that hahaha
3/12/19, 1:11 PM - Tim Ko: Apparently it‚Äôs less risky lol cuz then they can have live feedback on whether they are damaging another part of ur brain or not
3/12/19, 1:13 PM - Ricky: Hehe Jesus
3/12/19, 1:14 PM - Ricky: Like they just lose the ability to speak English?
3/12/19, 1:21 PM - Matt Casali: It probably's just like a trip to the dentist
3/12/19, 1:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: Go all Spanish buzz light year all of a sudden
3/12/19, 1:37 PM - Parker: Ohhh yeah! my grandpa would talk about that
3/12/19, 1:37 PM - Parker: he was a neurosurgeon
3/12/19, 1:38 PM - Parker: he said they like talk to you and test different things to make sure u still have full function for different areas
3/12/19, 1:38 PM - Parker: kinda crazy
3/12/19, 4:10 PM - Tim Ko: Oh shit that‚Äôs crazy dude haha
3/14/19, 8:58 AM - Matt Casali: Some phsycisit have turned back time
3/14/19, 8:58 AM - Matt Casali: Nbd
3/14/19, 8:58 AM - Matt Casali: https://phys.org/news/2019-03-physicists-reverse-quantum.html
3/14/19, 9:11 AM - Alex Starr: Wish I was clever enough to understand that haha
3/14/19, 9:13 AM - Jason Greenberg: It really is one sec
3/14/19, 9:14 AM - Jason Greenberg: https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613123/no-ibm-didnt-just-reverse-time-with-a-quantum-computer/
3/14/19, 9:15 AM - Alex Starr: This still holds
3/14/19, 9:15 AM - Jason Greenberg: MIT review says what journals are saying is conflating what is actually happening, and what is actually happening is not very significant
3/14/19, 9:15 AM - Jason Greenberg: I don‚Äôt understand it either but imma go with MIT
3/14/19, 9:17 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah it's not super duper significant
3/14/19, 9:17 AM - Matt Casali: But still cool
3/14/19, 9:17 AM - Matt Casali: And has very cool implications
3/14/19, 9:46 AM - Jason Greenberg: Like what?
3/14/19, 9:49 AM - Matt Casali: I forgot the exact term, but it was like reversibility or some shit
3/14/19, 9:49 AM - Matt Casali: It has to do with identical behavior across symmetric planes
3/14/19, 9:50 AM - Matt Casali: Its fundamental to our understanding of quantum mechanics
3/14/19, 9:50 AM - Matt Casali: And if the second law of thermodynamics can be broken like they've proven, then that means that the second law doesnt fuck stuff up anymore
3/14/19, 10:00 AM - Alex Starr: And the second law is...?
3/14/19, 10:01 AM - Matt Casali: Entropy of a system always increases or stays the same
3/14/19, 10:01 AM - Matt Casali: So you can always tell the difference between time going forward or going backward
3/14/19, 10:01 AM - Alex Starr: And cuz it went back to higher entropy state that‚Äôs not true?
3/14/19, 10:02 AM - Jason Greenberg: I don‚Äôt think they did that in the real world tho
3/14/19, 10:02 AM - Jason Greenberg: Just using quantum computing models
3/14/19, 10:02 AM - Matt Casali: Lower
3/14/19, 10:02 AM - Jason Greenberg: They ran a simulation in reverse
3/14/19, 10:02 AM - Matt Casali: I dont think it was a simulation..
3/14/19, 10:03 AM - Matt Casali: I think it's just not super groundbreaking cause it was 2-3 electrons haha
3/14/19, 10:06 AM - Matt Casali: To be fair I just read the article you sent
3/14/19, 10:06 AM - Jason Greenberg: <Media omitted>
3/14/19, 10:07 AM - Jason Greenberg: I‚Äôm reading yours
3/14/19, 10:07 AM - Matt Casali: And also to be fair, I dont think that means what you think it means
3/14/19, 10:07 AM - Jason Greenberg: Maybe not
3/14/19, 10:07 AM - Jason Greenberg: I‚Äôm trying looking for what the MIT people say
3/14/19, 10:07 AM - Matt Casali: There's a lot of artificial stuff that we create that would normally only happen once in the whole age of the universe
3/14/19, 10:08 AM - Matt Casali: But our two articles contradict each other I think
3/14/19, 10:08 AM - Jason Greenberg: Maybe the word is generalizability
3/14/19, 10:10 AM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
3/14/19, 10:11 AM - Matt Casali: Their abstract is dramatic though haha
3/14/19, 10:16 AM - Alex Starr: Right
3/14/19, 10:18 AM - Alex Starr: I got the impression not a simulation, but an insanely controlled environment that would occur in nature with an unrealistically low probability
3/14/19, 10:18 AM - Matt Casali: 1 time in the age of the universe to be precise haha
3/14/19, 10:18 AM - Alex Starr: I like those odds
3/14/19, 10:19 AM - Alex Starr: Reading this kinda stuff makes me envious of you sticking with physics Matt
3/14/19, 10:19 AM - Matt Casali: I mean it's cool and all until you realize that most physics people are douchebags
3/14/19, 10:20 AM - Matt Casali: And full of themselves
3/14/19, 10:20 AM - Matt Casali: I mean it definitely feels good to understand this on some fundamental level, dont get me wrong
3/14/19, 10:21 AM - Jason Greenberg: Also one of the grad fields with highest attrition and depression
3/14/19, 10:22 AM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah that‚Äôs gotta be cool
3/14/19, 10:22 AM - Alex Starr: That‚Äôs true of every scientist
3/14/19, 10:22 AM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
3/14/19, 10:22 AM - Alex Starr: At least every successful one for the most part
3/14/19, 10:23 AM - Alex Starr: If I get some sort of professorship in the future, you can bet that interacting with me will somehow be 10x more painful for about 5 years
3/14/19, 10:23 AM - Matt Casali: I mean like half of my class sucks
3/14/19, 10:24 AM - Alex Starr: At least they aren‚Äôt premed (sorry Tim)
3/14/19, 10:24 AM - Matt Casali: True
3/14/19, 10:24 AM - Jason Greenberg: Before tenure?
3/14/19, 10:24 AM - Alex Starr: Oh yeah they are the worst
3/14/19, 10:24 AM - Alex Starr: With tenure they can molest whoever they want so are much more relaxed
3/14/19, 10:24 AM - Matt Casali: Well they just dont give a fuck
3/14/19, 10:25 AM - Matt Casali: Too soon
3/14/19, 10:25 AM - Alex Starr: Which is worse than giving a fuck and being a prick about it imo
3/14/19, 10:25 AM - Matt Casali: You guys hear about that ucsc professor?
3/14/19, 10:25 AM - Jason Greenberg: Some aren‚Äôt
3/14/19, 10:25 AM - Alex Starr: Definitely lol
3/14/19, 10:25 AM - Alex Starr: Nope
3/14/19, 10:25 AM - Jason Greenberg: I know some young tenured profs with a lot to prove
3/14/19, 10:25 AM - Alex Starr: Matt ur going for grad school right?
3/14/19, 10:26 AM - Jason Greenberg: What happen
3/14/19, 10:26 AM - Alex Starr: They made Michael Jackson a professor emeritus
3/14/19, 10:26 AM - Matt Casali: History of consciousness professor frequently did drugs with students and some were minors (?) and he sexually harassed (raped?) one of the students
3/14/19, 10:26 AM - Jason Greenberg: Noo
3/14/19, 10:26 AM - Matt Casali: Depends where I get into and for what
3/14/19, 10:26 AM - Alex Starr: But applying yes?
3/14/19, 10:27 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah after a gap year
3/14/19, 10:27 AM - Jason Greenberg: Hyyype
3/14/19, 10:27 AM - Alex Starr: I‚Äôm increasingly unsure that neuroscience is the right call.  It‚Äôs very psychologyy, which I‚Äôm not that into
3/14/19, 10:27 AM - Alex Starr: ^
3/14/19, 10:28 AM - Matt Casali: Neuroscience is definitely the coolest though
3/14/19, 10:28 AM - Matt Casali: But
3/14/19, 10:28 AM - Matt Casali: Maybe a gap year would help you make a better decision about what you want to do
3/14/19, 10:29 AM - Alex Starr: Yeah ur probably right, but no way I‚Äôm going for gap year I think
3/14/19, 10:29 AM - Alex Starr: Having lots of potential paths is both good and bad, to put it uselessly
3/14/19, 10:29 AM - Matt Casali: Haha I agree
3/14/19, 10:30 AM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
3/14/19, 10:30 AM - Alex Starr: I also feel somewhat obligated to do biology
3/14/19, 10:30 AM - Alex Starr: Cuz I think I‚Äôm better at it than I am at pretty much anything else
3/14/19, 10:31 AM - Matt Casali: Out of nowhere you could go for contemporary Japanese history
3/14/19, 10:31 AM - Jason Greenberg: Which part of bio are you interested in?
3/14/19, 10:32 AM - Jason Greenberg: Part(s)
3/14/19, 10:33 AM - Alex Starr: Art history*
3/14/19, 10:34 AM - Alex Starr: Damn near all of it is cool to some extent, but especially molecular/synthetic biology neuroscience
3/14/19, 10:34 AM - Alex Starr: The fact that you can only apply to one program at each school sucks
3/14/19, 10:34 AM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah that is dumb
3/14/19, 10:35 AM - Matt Casali: Neuroscience and physics are my top two fields
3/14/19, 10:35 AM - Alex Starr: Cuz if I could get into CS or math, I might do that but my chances for biology are so so much higher
3/14/19, 10:35 AM - Jason Greenberg: Do you like research?
3/14/19, 10:35 AM - Alex Starr: I‚Äôm not sure what other options there are, but somewhat
3/14/19, 10:36 AM - Alex Starr: Physics -> neuroscience is a classic
3/14/19, 10:36 AM - Matt Casali: Is there any harm in applying to schools for CS and math that you could get into?
3/14/19, 10:36 AM - Alex Starr: No, but given the choice between Stanford biology and I dunno UC Irvine CS I‚Äôm gonna pick Stanford
3/14/19, 10:36 AM - Jason Greenberg: And the other obvious question is do you like teaching?
3/14/19, 10:37 AM - Alex Starr: Yes
3/14/19, 10:37 AM - Jason Greenberg: Boom easy
3/14/19, 10:37 AM - Alex Starr: Now just have to make it over some 1 in 10, 1 in 100, 1 in 1000 hurdles and I‚Äôm  there
3/14/19, 10:38 AM - Jason Greenberg: Those are some hurdles
3/14/19, 10:39 AM - Matt Casali: My favorite neuroscience fact is that chickpeas have some of the highest levels of tryptophan and you need tryptophan to create seratonin
3/14/19, 10:39 AM - Jason Greenberg: Nice
3/14/19, 10:39 AM - Matt Casali: Just in case you all wanted to know
3/14/19, 10:39 AM - Jason Greenberg: Didn‚Äôt know chickpeas were high in tryptophan
3/14/19, 10:40 AM - Jason Greenberg: Would you ever do a post bac Matt?
3/14/19, 10:41 AM - Alex Starr: Is that what a post doc is called in psychology?
3/14/19, 10:41 AM - Jason Greenberg: Post bachelor‚Äôs
3/14/19, 10:42 AM - Alex Starr: What‚Äôs that
3/14/19, 10:42 AM - Alex Starr: A masters?
3/14/19, 10:42 AM - Parker: good to know
3/14/19, 10:42 AM - Jason Greenberg: You can do them between under and grad to raise gpa/take relevant classes
3/14/19, 10:42 AM - Jason Greenberg: Not a masters
3/14/19, 10:42 AM - Matt Casali: Umm probably not?
3/14/19, 10:43 AM - Matt Casali: My GPA isnt too bad and certainly not bad enough for me to want to do more non graduate studies
3/14/19, 10:43 AM - Jason Greenberg: Right but mostly for taking classes that are needed for diff grad programs
3/14/19, 10:43 AM - Matt Casali: Oh well maybe then
3/14/19, 10:44 AM - Matt Casali: I've done little to no thinking about where I want to grad school/what I want to do when I'm there
3/14/19, 10:46 AM - Jason Greenberg: You should do that
3/14/19, 10:47 AM - Jason Greenberg: I used self-authoring.com and it helped a lot
3/14/19, 10:47 AM - Jason Greenberg: That is not a paid endorsement
3/14/19, 10:47 AM - Jason Greenberg: Just seems like a Matt thing
3/14/19, 10:47 AM - Jason Greenberg: Wait no hyphen selfauthoring.com**
3/14/19, 10:48 AM - Alex Starr: I thought about essentially doing that Jason, but dislike being here so much that I‚Äôve pretty much ruled it out
3/14/19, 10:48 AM - Matt Casali: Hahah
3/14/19, 10:49 AM - Jason Greenberg: Different school post bac?
3/14/19, 10:49 AM - Jason Greenberg: I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs a thing
3/14/19, 10:49 AM - Matt Casali: You paid for those online writing prompts?
3/14/19, 10:51 AM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah they‚Äôre a product of Jordan Peterson, a professor at Toronto U who has been very successful lately and helping people adopt more responsibility and put their lives together on a large scale
3/14/19, 10:51 AM - Jason Greenberg: I‚Äôm about 3 times more productive after doing it over winter break
3/14/19, 10:52 AM - Jason Greenberg: Because I got a much clearer sense of what I want to do with my life, and what success and failure would look like
3/14/19, 10:52 AM - Alex Starr: Wow that‚Äôs an accurate measurement
3/14/19, 10:52 AM - Alex Starr: What is that if you don‚Äôt mind me asking
3/14/19, 10:52 AM - Jason Greenberg: Not my words
3/14/19, 10:52 AM - Jason Greenberg: It‚Äôs his research on the tool
3/14/19, 10:52 AM - Jason Greenberg: I can find the relevant lecture
3/14/19, 10:53 AM - Matt Casali: That's a very big promise haha
3/14/19, 10:54 AM - Jason Greenberg: https://youtu.be/CZ_g0J2SPpM
3/14/19, 10:55 AM - Alex Starr: I meant what‚Äôs it look like for you haha
3/14/19, 10:55 AM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah it is but they used it for students at a school and increase graduation rates by something like 20%
3/14/19, 10:56 AM - Jason Greenberg: I mean basically I want to be a therapist
3/14/19, 10:56 AM - Jason Greenberg: And potentially a teacher
3/14/19, 10:57 AM - Jason Greenberg: There are other things I‚Äôve identified but that‚Äôs the career one. And the fact that I want a career and not a job
3/14/19, 10:58 AM - Matt Casali: I'm gonna talk with my therapist haha
3/14/19, 10:58 AM - Matt Casali: Maybe after that's done I'll know if that's a good choice for me or not
3/14/19, 10:59 AM - Jason Greenberg: The distinction being that a job is something like 9 to 5 and you do the things that are assigned to you and go home while in a career you are never done
3/14/19, 10:59 AM - Alex Starr: It‚Äôs definitely different
3/14/19, 10:59 AM - Alex Starr: My dad just went from job to career and it‚Äôs kinda weird
3/14/19, 11:00 AM - Jason Greenberg: Why?
3/14/19, 11:00 AM - Alex Starr: It‚Äôs just different
3/14/19, 11:00 AM - Alex Starr: Career is waaaay more work
3/14/19, 11:00 AM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah
3/14/19, 11:01 AM - Matt Casali: Career would be hard with a family imo
3/14/19, 11:01 AM - Alex Starr: I was mostly supporting ur assertion that they are different
3/14/19, 11:01 AM - Alex Starr: That‚Äôs why he didn‚Äôt move sooner
3/14/19, 11:01 AM - Jason Greenberg: Most people won‚Äôt have a career
3/14/19, 11:01 AM - Matt Casali: Not impossible, but hard
3/14/19, 11:01 AM - Alex Starr: Or part of it
3/14/19, 11:01 AM - Alex Starr: A lot of people wind up having kids at like 40 or 45 with career
3/14/19, 11:02 AM - Matt Casali: Midlife crisis
3/14/19, 11:02 AM - Alex Starr: No just slowing down and having the time
3/14/19, 11:02 AM - Alex Starr: Or both
3/14/19, 11:02 AM - Alex Starr: But it needn‚Äôt be that I‚Äôm saying
3/14/19, 11:04 AM - Alex Starr: The key is to not need much sleep
3/14/19, 11:08 AM - Jason Greenberg: It‚Äôs a sacrifice some people make unfortunately
3/14/19, 11:09 AM - Jason Greenberg: John Cena gets like 4 I think
3/14/19, 11:13 AM - Parker: ^
3/14/19, 12:31 PM - Matt Casali: Self authoring seems cool Jason
3/14/19, 12:32 PM - Matt Casali: Except for the fact that it was mainly authored by Jordan B. Peterson
3/14/19, 12:32 PM - Matt Casali: A colossal douchebag and buttfuck
3/14/19, 12:32 PM - Matt Casali: Not buttfuck
3/14/19, 12:32 PM - Matt Casali: More like asshat?
3/14/19, 12:38 PM - Matt Casali: I thought reading an interview with him would make me more okay with him but now I may hate him even more haha
3/14/19, 12:41 PM - Matt Casali: He's an icon for the incel movement and promotes gender inequality as justifiable
3/14/19, 1:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Read more
3/14/19, 1:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Watch a debate or lecture
3/14/19, 1:04 PM - Matt Casali: :/
3/14/19, 1:04 PM - Matt Casali: Seems like a bad guy
3/14/19, 1:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: That‚Äôs not true
3/14/19, 1:04 PM - Matt Casali: I'll just commit to writing on my own
3/14/19, 1:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: He doesn‚Äôt promote gender inequality
3/14/19, 1:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: That would be ridiculous
3/14/19, 1:05 PM - Matt Casali: Well he says that gender inequality doesnt exist anymore
3/14/19, 1:05 PM - Matt Casali: Which basically does the same thing
3/14/19, 1:06 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
3/14/19, 1:06 PM - Matt Casali: Men wont do responsible work
3/14/19, 1:07 PM - Matt Casali: Idk Jason, I get a bad feeling from this dude
3/14/19, 1:07 PM - Matt Casali: https://www.google.com/amp/amp.timeinc.net/time/5175974/jordan-peterson-12-rules-book-interview
3/14/19, 1:07 PM - Matt Casali: That's the interview I read
3/14/19, 1:07 PM - Matt Casali: I'll watch a lecture
3/14/19, 1:07 PM - Matt Casali: But I have very strong a bias against him rn
3/14/19, 1:07 PM - Matt Casali: *a very strong
3/14/19, 1:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: I‚Äôm not sure how his response there supports your argument that he promotes gender inequality
3/14/19, 1:09 PM - Matt Casali: He's claiming that gender inequality doesnt exist. That we've solved the problem in the west
3/14/19, 1:09 PM - Matt Casali: It's a lot like saying racism doesnt exist
3/14/19, 1:09 PM - Alex Starr: That‚Äôs hardly the same thing as being pro gender inequality
3/14/19, 1:09 PM - Matt Casali: It ignores the fact that there's a problem
3/14/19, 1:10 PM - Alex Starr: It ignores that many people think there is a problem
3/14/19, 1:10 PM - Alex Starr: Fact seems strong
3/14/19, 1:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: How does that say that gender inequality doesn‚Äôt exist? I also think that isn‚Äôt such an issue on the whole
3/14/19, 1:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah he‚Äôs one of the most convincing speakers I‚Äôve heard in a long time
3/14/19, 1:11 PM - Matt Casali: There's another quote, I'll find it when I'm on the bus
3/14/19, 1:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: Context is important
3/14/19, 1:14 PM - Alex Starr: I agree with Matt that he seems a bit off and or awful
3/14/19, 1:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: Based on that quote?
3/14/19, 1:14 PM - Alex Starr: No the whole interview
3/14/19, 1:15 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
3/14/19, 1:15 PM - Matt Casali: No evidence, he says, that women are being systematically held back
3/14/19, 1:15 PM - Alex Starr: Key word there is systematically
3/14/19, 1:15 PM - Matt Casali: No evidence???
3/14/19, 1:16 PM - Alex Starr: Are woman being held back? Yes.  Is it systematic? Idk.
3/14/19, 1:16 PM - Matt Casali: I think the answer there is yes
3/14/19, 1:16 PM - Matt Casali: Maternity leave is an example of that
3/14/19, 1:16 PM - Alex Starr: Depends on how u define systematic, cuz there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a system by which women are held back
3/14/19, 1:17 PM - Alex Starr: Hardly systematic imo
3/14/19, 1:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: It also depends on how you define held back
3/14/19, 1:17 PM - Alex Starr: Let‚Äôs not go full bill clinton
3/14/19, 1:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: Bad example
3/14/19, 1:19 PM - Matt Casali: Okay well I'm not gonna argue about how the world we live in is not made for the achievement of women and is made to fit men, cause I'm not qualified or informed enough. But also cause I shouldnt really have to?
3/14/19, 1:19 PM - Matt Casali: I feel like you guys know this
3/14/19, 1:19 PM - Matt Casali: And the guy does say things I agree with
3/14/19, 1:19 PM - Alex Starr: What? I don‚Äôt think the world is ‚Äúmade to fit men‚Äù.  Our entire school system has been shown to benefit women for one thing
3/14/19, 1:19 PM - Matt Casali: And maybe he's right about identity and how you should discover yourself
3/14/19, 1:19 PM - Jason Greenberg: Again the question is how you define held back
3/14/19, 1:19 PM - Matt Casali: But hes a dick
3/14/19, 1:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: Well you‚Äôre entitled to that opinion
3/14/19, 1:20 PM - Alex Starr: we are missing the opportunity for larger discussion by focusing on that guy
3/14/19, 1:20 PM - Matt Casali: Like I said
3/14/19, 1:21 PM - Matt Casali: I'm not qualified for that discussion, sadly and it wouldn't really be productive
3/14/19, 1:23 PM - Alex Starr: But you‚Äôre qualified to condemn that guy despite not being qualified to have that discussion?
3/14/19, 1:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: I mean you could look into the gender-equality paradox as a place to start
3/14/19, 1:24 PM - Matt Casali: I know enough about my beliefs to know that I dont like him
3/14/19, 1:24 PM - Matt Casali: But I dont think any of the arguments that I made stand to much scrutiny
3/14/19, 1:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: Research has shown that as societies increase in gender equality, gender-based preferences become increasingly different
3/14/19, 1:25 PM - Matt Casali: Maybe gender-equity is the term I'm looking for
3/14/19, 1:25 PM - Matt Casali: Because you're right, gender-equality makes no sense
3/14/19, 1:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: Well what is unfair about things right now?
3/14/19, 1:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: If that‚Äôs what you mean
3/14/19, 1:29 PM - Matt Casali: Pay gap, sexual harassment disparity between men and women, and a lot of other individual relationships between men and women
3/14/19, 1:29 PM - Matt Casali: Its hard for me to name stuff, but I feel like it should be obvious that things aren't fair right now
3/14/19, 1:30 PM - Matt Casali: Do you think that things are fair right now?
3/14/19, 1:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: Sexual harassment is definitely a problem tho I think it is not much help in addressing issues like pay gap
3/14/19, 1:32 PM - Matt Casali: I never said they were a cause of one another
3/14/19, 1:32 PM - Matt Casali: They're just both disparities between men and qomen
3/14/19, 1:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hang on
3/14/19, 1:33 PM - Matt Casali: ^
3/14/19, 1:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah the statistics about pay gaps are misleading because news organizations report them as between men and women when they are about the difference between mothers and fathers. The reason there is a gap is because of different decisions mother and fathers make about family and work. The National Bureau of Economic Research published a study that showed the gender gap "can be attributed to the dynamic effects of children." If mothers were had equal hours at work as fathers did this would not be an issue. The two be problems with the way people talk about this data is as men against women, instead of mothers against fathers, and as sexism, rather than children
3/14/19, 1:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: Here is the study: https://www.henrikkleven.com/uploads/3/7/3/1/37310663/kleven-landais-sogaard_nber-w24219_jan2018.pdf
3/14/19, 1:41 PM - Matt Casali: Okay
3/14/19, 1:42 PM - Matt Casali: You're ignoring my question
3/14/19, 1:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: Do I think things are fair?
3/14/19, 1:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: It depends on what things you are referring to
3/14/19, 1:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: Be specific
3/14/19, 1:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: It also depends on how you define fair
3/14/19, 1:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: Like in what context?
3/14/19, 1:45 PM - Matt Casali: Well you asked me how things were unfair
3/14/19, 1:45 PM - Matt Casali: That's just as specific
3/14/19, 1:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: I don‚Äôt think fair is the outcome we should be concerned with. But I can‚Äôt address your claims of unfairness unless you offer specific examples
3/14/19, 1:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: And I‚Äôm worried that you‚Äôre conflating fair with equal outcome and I‚Äôm just generally not clear about the argument you‚Äôre making
3/14/19, 1:49 PM - Matt Casali: Okay
3/14/19, 1:50 PM - Matt Casali: Do you think that men and women have an equal chance of success and happiness?
3/14/19, 1:50 PM - Matt Casali: Averaging all men and all women
3/14/19, 1:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: That depends on a number of things and it really comes down to individual situations for that
3/14/19, 1:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: Again not very specific
3/14/19, 1:51 PM - Matt Casali: It's more specific
3/14/19, 1:51 PM - Matt Casali: And I think it's easy to give a general answer
3/14/19, 1:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: A better question would be how do you would you measure success of men and women
3/14/19, 1:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: Well a general answer is only and general answer and not very useful in specific applications like policy
3/14/19, 1:53 PM - Matt Casali: But it's a starting point
3/14/19, 1:54 PM - Matt Casali: How about this
3/14/19, 1:54 PM - Matt Casali: Do you think a man and a woman have the same chance of being sexually harassed in the workplace?
3/14/19, 1:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: No definitely not
3/14/19, 1:54 PM - Matt Casali: Okay, well do you think that affects the average person's happiness?
3/14/19, 1:55 PM - Matt Casali: Ability to move up a corporate ladder?
3/14/19, 1:55 PM - Matt Casali: Feel comfortable and have space to grow as a person?
3/14/19, 1:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: Men are more aggressive and prone to that sort of behavior. They also have larger regions of the brain devoted to seeking out sex on average which would increase the likelihood of a transgression
3/14/19, 1:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: It can
3/14/19, 1:55 PM - Matt Casali: Why?
3/14/19, 1:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: It depends. In general tho ‚Äúascending the corporate ladder‚Äù has less to do with power and more to do with competence
3/14/19, 1:56 PM - Matt Casali: It does
3/14/19, 1:57 PM - Matt Casali: Competence though is largely decided by the power and privelage you were given to discover that competence
3/14/19, 1:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: That‚Äôs what the literature says. Aggression could be the mechanism by which men increase their evolutionary fitness
3/14/19, 1:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: What do you mean?
3/14/19, 1:57 PM - Matt Casali: Could be, but if we're talking about testosterone here, it doesn't only affect agression
3/14/19, 1:58 PM - Matt Casali: Testosterone is also linked to people being more compassionate and peaceful
3/14/19, 1:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: No but men are generally more aggressive than women
3/14/19, 1:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: Which is one reason to explain the differences in sexual harrassment and assault
3/14/19, 1:59 PM - Matt Casali: Wait why was this even brought up?
3/14/19, 1:59 PM - Matt Casali: This is just showing that men abuse women more
3/14/19, 2:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: You asked this and wanted to use it as proof that women can‚Äôt ascend the corporate latter as well as men
3/14/19, 2:00 PM - Matt Casali: And you agree?
3/14/19, 2:00 PM - Matt Casali: I'm confused
3/14/19, 2:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: I don‚Äôt believe that sexual harrassment is why women can‚Äôt ‚Äúascend the corporate ladder‚Äù
3/14/19, 2:01 PM - Matt Casali: Okay I didnt know how else to phrase it then "ascend the corporate ladder"
3/14/19, 2:01 PM - Matt Casali: So we can drop that
3/14/19, 2:02 PM - Matt Casali: But sexual harassment keeps someone from functioning normally
3/14/19, 2:03 PM - Matt Casali: And actually, I think it's only one of many reasons
3/14/19, 2:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: So here is the problem. You need a high degree of disagreeableness to be in a positions of greater authority and _on average_ women are more agreeable than men. This is because they have to be able to put up with very disagreeable children and evolutionarily it is an advantage to be patient and agreeable when raising children otherwise you would probably hate your own offspring. Given that disparity, it is important to offset this difference by training women to be more assertive and less agreeable in work environments so that they can move up and hold higher positions
3/14/19, 2:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: There‚Äôs a reason why they say you have to be a psychopath to be a CEO, and it‚Äôs not because you need to be caring and empathetic to get there obviously
3/14/19, 2:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: The literature firmly supports that women are more agreeable than men however and this is probably the most key problem to address for helping women succeed in the workplace
3/14/19, 2:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: I plan on learning to do assertiveness training and offer it as a service in my practice
3/14/19, 2:10 PM - Matt Casali: Another disadvantage in a list of systematic disadvantages put on women by power relationships between men and women and in some cases institutions that were not made for them
3/14/19, 2:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: Agreeableness is not systematic
3/14/19, 2:10 PM - Matt Casali: No its not
3/14/19, 2:10 PM - Matt Casali: But it's another disadvantage
3/14/19, 2:11 PM - Matt Casali: That's what I meant
3/14/19, 2:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: Well not artificially systematic, evolutionarily
3/14/19, 2:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: Such as
3/14/19, 2:12 PM - Matt Casali: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theodysseyonline.com/the-professional-world-still-disadvantages-women.amp
3/14/19, 2:13 PM - Matt Casali: I think this explains some of it from the first couple paragraphs that I read
3/14/19, 2:16 PM - Matt Casali: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4485027/
3/14/19, 2:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: So she uses her experiences with socialization as an explanation for inherent biases and disadvantages that women face in stem. Her teachers were less confident or discouraged her from pursuing careers in stem and sure that good lead to negative outcomes. She also uses examples of loneliness and isolation in reference to few women at the top of their fields. The first argument could make a difference but it doesn‚Äôt matter because we have examples more gender-equal societies with the Nordic countries and there we see that preferences diverge more with equal treatment of genders, which simply means that women are interested in different things than men on average and I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with that. Again that‚Äôs the gender-equality paradox. Secondly she says that isolation is a pressure that discourages women from the top of their fields and while it may, it more multifaceted than that and has to do more with why women are isolated at the top of their fields. For that we can look at agreeableness.
3/14/19, 2:25 PM - Matt Casali: And systematic disadvantages
3/14/19, 2:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: What?
3/14/19, 2:26 PM - Matt Casali: Wait how do you even know women are more agreeable than men?
3/14/19, 2:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: Psychological testing
3/14/19, 2:27 PM - Matt Casali: That's very vague
3/14/19, 2:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: I don‚Äôt remember the specific article but I promise it‚Äôs a very real finding and I encourage you to look it up
3/14/19, 2:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
3/14/19, 2:28 PM - Matt Casali: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3149680/
3/14/19, 2:28 PM - Matt Casali: This?
3/14/19, 2:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hold on I‚Äôm answering your second article
3/14/19, 2:29 PM - Alex Starr: A couple things: 
I‚Äôd be careful identifying evolutionarily causal relationships, they are damn near impossible to pin down though that does not take away at all from the assertion that women are more agreeable than men.
Second, I agree with Jason that it is this lack of aggression that is perhaps the largest factor holding women back and can confirm that a lot of women agree with this statement
3/14/19, 2:30 PM - Matt Casali: I think those are only part of the large clusterfuck or things holding women back
3/14/19, 2:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: Look the second article says that women cannot ascend corporate structures as frequently as men because of stigmas about lack of confidence but this is the wrong argument to even go about
3/14/19, 2:30 PM - Matt Casali: HAHAHA wait
3/14/19, 2:30 PM - Matt Casali: I hope the article I sent isnt the one you're talking about
3/14/19, 2:30 PM - Matt Casali: Because
3/14/19, 2:31 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
3/14/19, 2:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: I‚Äôm talking about the perspective with no data
3/14/19, 2:31 PM - Matt Casali: That's not what its about
3/14/19, 2:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lol classy
3/14/19, 2:32 PM - Matt Casali: In fact it says that's the least important factor
3/14/19, 2:32 PM - Matt Casali: It says right after that, that the confidence thing is a little factor but it ignores the bigger picture
3/14/19, 2:32 PM - Matt Casali: I'd encourage you to actually read through it
3/14/19, 2:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yes I see that, at least that we agree on that. It further talks about implicit prejudice as the cause for women not being able to ascend the career latter and while I‚Äôm not saying that prejudice doesn‚Äôt hurt women in the workplace, that kind of thing is very difficult to measure and draw strong of conclusions from
3/14/19, 2:40 PM - Matt Casali: Difficult to measure but hard to not see
3/14/19, 2:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: I think it‚Äôs more reasonable to assume look at things you can measure in some degree like personality, competence, and agreeableness
3/14/19, 2:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: Not very helpful in your argument
3/14/19, 2:41 PM - Matt Casali: Just cause something is difficult to measure doesnt mean it's not real and affecting people
3/14/19, 2:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: It‚Äôs beside the point tho because of the gender-equality paradox
3/14/19, 2:42 PM - Matt Casali: Right now I'm walking like 3 miles after traveling for 2 hours and I'm not really feeling this haha
3/14/19, 2:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: in societies where everyone is treated much more equally you see more women and men choosing different careers and divides increasing
3/14/19, 2:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: Suit yourself
3/14/19, 2:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: Those divides include leadership positions and the number of participants in the studies are in the thousands
3/14/19, 3:50 PM - Ricky: This was interesting to read, I feel like your arguing about an unquantifiable variable so there is no right or wrong but a cool debate, I‚Äôd say you both equally pulled me in opposite directions and I got nowhere but I was educated!
3/14/19, 3:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: Which variable?
3/14/19, 5:15 PM - Tim Ko: All I know is that in coed intramural basketball at Berkeley, guys can‚Äôt go into the paint whereas girls can.
3/14/19, 5:15 PM - Tim Ko: If that‚Äôs not sexist then I don‚Äôt know what is
3/14/19, 5:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: haha omg is that true?
3/14/19, 5:17 PM - Tim Ko: Yup
3/14/19, 5:17 PM - Tim Ko: And if u say u identify as a girl, they still won‚Äôt let u in
3/14/19, 5:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: damn i wonder who came up with that
3/14/19, 5:17 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah idk
3/14/19, 5:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: haha have you done this?
3/14/19, 5:31 PM - Tim Ko: No but I‚Äôve seen people try lmao
3/14/19, 5:33 PM - Ricky: Like all of them I feel like, you both provide papers but neither are convinced, which is why math is OP, none of this evolution shit
3/14/19, 5:35 PM - Matt Casali: I'm so confused
3/14/19, 5:52 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah that one wasn‚Äôt a winner in terms of sense making
3/14/19, 5:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: evolution shit?
3/14/19, 5:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: have you ever taken a bio class?
3/14/19, 5:55 PM - Alex Starr: To be fair, it is ridiculously hard to show causality in evolution
3/14/19, 5:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: And i understand the argument Matt is making and i can see why he's making it so i am convinced in that sensed
3/14/19, 5:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: does that mean we should not use to attempt explain behaviors?
3/14/19, 5:58 PM - Alex Starr: No, but it‚Äôs important to phrase it with a lot of uncertainty
3/14/19, 5:58 PM - Alex Starr: Some scientists think that the need to deal with belligerent children led to mothers being more agreeable
3/14/19, 5:59 PM - Alex Starr: Not mothers are more agreeable because they had to deal with belligerent children
3/14/19, 6:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: yes i agree that is important not to overstress implications of a finding, more important with less scientifically oriented people, but less strict in the cases where you feel confident that the people you are speaking to understand this limitation of science such as speaking to a professor about a research project in which you both are confident in shared understandings, or when speaking to other stem students you don't have to be as careful in reexplaining this very basic understanding
3/14/19, 6:10 PM - Alex Starr: I didn‚Äôt understand how hard it was to prove positive selection until last year
3/14/19, 6:10 PM - Alex Starr: I still don‚Äôt fully get it
3/14/19, 6:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: Is that about diversifying selection?
3/14/19, 6:26 PM - Alex Starr: No it‚Äôs that selection is just so rare
3/14/19, 6:26 PM - Alex Starr: Drift is dominant
3/14/19, 6:32 PM - Alex Starr: Plus showing positive selection is then caused by some factor is much much harder cuz there just isn‚Äôt a good way to run an experiment on that
3/14/19, 6:41 PM - Matt Casali: I would also encourage you all to listen to women speakers and other experts on the subject
3/14/19, 6:42 PM - Alex Starr: I mean there are definitely differences of opinion
3/14/19, 6:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: anyone in particular? any particular subject?
3/14/19, 6:43 PM - Alex Starr: For example that study u linked cites an Atlantic article with a very different opinion
3/14/19, 6:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: matt i've been where you are i hope I understand what you're trying to say. you seem to be arguing that women are systematically oppressed due to factors like workplace discrimination by gender. A wealth gap between men and women is evidence that this discrimination exists, and the lack of women in positions of power and in stem is also evidence of this discrimination. Women only recently entered the workforce an existing systems are based on patriarchal power structures that prevent them from advancing in the same way that men can. That's where this backlash is coming from and the way to fix it is by creating more opportunity, maybe at the expense of those groups currently in power for women and to educate everyone about prejudice and discrimination.
3/14/19, 6:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: Is that close to your view point?
3/14/19, 6:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: And hopefully concisely simplified not overly simplified
3/14/19, 7:13 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah and I mean theres a lot of other things that are hard to explain
3/14/19, 7:13 PM - Matt Casali: Like personal experiences with power differences between women and men
3/14/19, 7:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: You could try
3/14/19, 7:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: But that does fall under the umbrella of differences in power based on existing power systems
3/14/19, 7:15 PM - Alex Starr: Random anecdote, but I buy the argument that lack of confidence/aggression is a big deal (not the only deal).  My mom entered a program trying to get more women into the C-suite since she‚Äôs focused on career more now that kids are leaving, and at least for her, that explanation really resonated and seemed to resonate with a ton of the other women at the conference
3/14/19, 7:15 PM - Matt Casali: I could try, but they suck and I dont _really_ wanna think about it right now haha
3/14/19, 7:18 PM - Jason Greenberg: Do you know what they did to train people? I'm assuming they trained people
3/14/19, 7:26 PM - Alex Starr: For my mom, she wasn‚Äôt really aware that people were that aggressive in negotiating, and now that she‚Äôs aware that is the norm or an option, she is
3/14/19, 7:27 PM - Alex Starr: More aggressive
3/14/19, 7:33 PM - Alex Starr: Jason what‚Äôs ur opinion on all this
3/14/19, 7:33 PM - Alex Starr: Summarize like this but for you
3/14/19, 7:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: I don't blame you, it's a difficult argument to substantiate because has it rest on some dangerous postmodern thinking (oppressor vs. oppressed) and groupthink, which makes discourse about it is difficult, especially at universities. Look at how things went for that google employee a while back who tried to make the case that men tend to take more jobs in tech out of preference. The media roasted him alive and Google actually fired him. And I was on the side of the media then because I had never questioned whether men were truly oppressing women. It can be a dangerous dogmatic way of thinking that rewards you for blinding taking on the feminist ideology as a man, in part because women will recognize that and reward you for that. And it's not that women who support the idea that a patriarchal power structure exists are evil or even ill-intentioned. In my own life, when I was in journalism, we did a stand-up sit-down activity and one of the prompts was, "Stand up if you consider yourself a feminist." And I was about a junior in high school at the time as I didn't quite have my definitions worked out as to what a feminist was, I thought it only applied to women, as you might as a high school junior. And so you stay seated and look around and notice that everyone else is standing. And the someone looks at you and says, "You aren't a feminist?" incredulously and then the teacher shifts around and says "Who isn't standing? Is someone not standing?" And you realize that you're in trouble because there was a very strong expectation for you to be a certain way in this journalism class. And as a result you've been ostracized from a system that the teacher bought into as well, and not because you aren't a good journalist; (I was a produced a relatively biting satirist column that a world class journalist complimented the paper for during a visit) but because you don't seemingly outwardly agree with them. And that's a very bad thing because we don't want to hinder competence if we're going to achieve better outcomes. You have to reward competence and encourage people. And that's the opposite of what can happen if you create systems on false assumptions about creating better outcomes. And you absolutely cannot limit free speech about it either which i see as a mechanism for correcting dogmatic problems. The point is that it seems as though the idea about "patriarchy" is based on faulty evidence and if we perpetuate it we could end up with very backward systems. Because currently I believe that our dominance hierarchies (workplace, you name it) are based in competence, not power. And that's a very important distinction that is supported by behavioral ecology models.
3/14/19, 7:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: Because if you think that dominance hierarchies are something new and invented by a patriarchy, you're just wrong. There's evidence of dominance hierarchies in lobsters which are 360 million years old, and you bet there isn't a patriarchy responsible for that. So dominance hierarchies are nothing new. They've been around forever. I would argue that they create individual stability and social order. And the lobsters we identify as at the top are the most competent ones, the one's who win the most fights. Primates clearly have dominance hierarchies as we've seen in the wild and sometimes they are really nasty, especially chimps man. But to think that if these structures have existed for millions of years that humans have somehow circumvented the traditional mechanisms that they operate, I would look very very closely at whatever reasons I had presumed these differences came about from.
3/14/19, 7:55 PM - Alex Starr: That to me does not rule out the system being favorable for men
3/14/19, 7:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: No that's not what I'm arguing
3/14/19, 7:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: That is just an argument for why there is not a patriarchy in the form that extreme leftist and those on the left have suggested
3/14/19, 7:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: Because if we establish that heirarchys are built on competence, then we can properly go about affecting outcomes
3/14/19, 8:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: I would like to revise this and say in part because women who identify and perpetuate a feminist ideology as we have defined with Matt's viewpoint here, will recognize that and reward you
3/14/19, 8:05 PM - Alex Starr: Problem is I don‚Äôt think Matt is arguing for that strong of a patriarchy
3/14/19, 8:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: Well what is he arguing for
3/14/19, 8:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: I don't disagree I'm just anticipating the argument that matches goes with this ideology, but it doesn't mean that he could absolutely be referring to something else
3/14/19, 8:07 PM - Alex Starr: Okay I got the impression that his patriarchy was much watered down
3/14/19, 8:07 PM - Alex Starr: But I could be wrong
3/14/19, 8:08 PM - Alex Starr: Do you think that attempts should be made to get more women into positions in which they currently underrepresented should be made?
3/14/19, 8:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: Not all positions
3/14/19, 8:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: because if you're going to do that why wouldn't you do that at every level?
3/14/19, 8:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: Over 90 percent of brick layers are men
3/14/19, 8:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: Do we want equal representation from both genders there? I don't know it seems rather unimportant
3/14/19, 8:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: The majority of prisoners are men. Are we going to take action to equalize the genders there? I wouldn't think so
3/14/19, 8:10 PM - Matt Casali: I agree with basically nothing haha
3/14/19, 8:11 PM - Alex Starr: I think the argument is that issues specific to women will not be properly legislated on without female representatives
3/14/19, 8:11 PM - Alex Starr: And that diversity in fields like engineering and sciences has been shown to improve productivity
3/14/19, 8:12 PM - Alex Starr: And that competence is not rewarded to the greatest extent possible due to bias against women, whether systematic or individual
3/14/19, 8:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: I think that's a reasonable place to look but I wouldn't know enough about our political structures to really address it
3/14/19, 8:12 PM - Alex Starr: It definitely seems to be the case from what I‚Äôve read
3/14/19, 8:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yes this is true as well. I don't know that there have been enough real world studies done on the intersection between diversity and competence trade off but I could be wrong. It's very difficult to measure.
3/14/19, 8:14 PM - Alex Starr: My dad showed me a couple, benefits are there but not staggering
3/14/19, 8:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: I've seen it in math simulations and things like that. Are there companies that have looked at this with a lot of good data?
3/14/19, 8:15 PM - Alex Starr: I think so
3/14/19, 8:16 PM - Alex Starr: I do agree with you that it seems like people have their heads bitten off for disagreeing and that isn‚Äôt great
3/14/19, 8:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: Could you flush this out a bit more?
3/14/19, 8:17 PM - Alex Starr: Sure
3/14/19, 8:17 PM - Alex Starr: Let‚Äôs say there are 2 candidates for a job one is male one is female
3/14/19, 8:17 PM - Alex Starr: The female is 93% competent the male is 90%.  There‚Äôs a 5% bias in favor of men.
3/14/19, 8:18 PM - Alex Starr: The man is selected, productivity is lost
3/14/19, 8:19 PM - Alex Starr: The source of the bias, whether systemic, individual, cuz they are from Venus, cuz you need to eat a snickers is irrelevant
3/14/19, 8:19 PM - Jason Greenberg: I agree that if that is true in that degree it is a problem
3/14/19, 8:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: And i agree with you that source of bias is irrelevant
3/14/19, 8:23 PM - Alex Starr: I think there‚Äôs an argument to be made that it is near that scale
3/14/19, 8:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: How do you think we should deal with that?
3/14/19, 8:31 PM - Alex Starr: I don‚Äôt
3/14/19, 8:31 PM - Alex Starr: We‚Äôve got way bigger fish to fry
3/14/19, 8:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: I think we're on the same page about equality of opportunity tho
3/14/19, 8:32 PM - Alex Starr: What‚Äôs that page
3/14/19, 8:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: That's it's more important than equity
3/14/19, 8:33 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah probably
3/14/19, 8:34 PM - Alex Starr: My honest opinion is that these concerns are extremely secondary
3/14/19, 8:35 PM - Jason Greenberg: to
3/14/19, 8:35 PM - Alex Starr: Every story about this, every dollar spent on it, every hour spent working on it could be spent attempting to reduce the number of hungry people, incidence of disease, fighting climate change, getting insanely good at lawn darts, this list goes on
3/14/19, 8:37 PM - Alex Starr: Lawn darts is a joke, but I‚Äôd say in terms of how much this would help people, increasing equality of opportunity and equity in first world western countries is more similar in importance to humanity‚Äôs skill at lawn darts than it is climate change or cancer or space exploration
3/14/19, 8:37 PM - Alex Starr: Obviously on an absolute scale not relative
3/14/19, 8:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: I see your point that there are some pressing problems but I've got to pay attention to this kind of thing personally if I'm going to be a good therapist
3/14/19, 8:39 PM - Alex Starr: Oh yeah it‚Äôs not to say it‚Äôs not important
3/14/19, 8:40 PM - Alex Starr: It‚Äôs relatively unimportant
3/14/19, 8:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: relatively yes there are bigger issues.
3/14/19, 8:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: it depends on what you concern yourself with obviously
3/14/19, 8:43 PM - Alex Starr: And our priorities are out of whack
3/14/19, 8:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: what are they?
3/14/19, 8:43 PM - Alex Starr: Plus it‚Äôs this hugely difficult problem
3/14/19, 8:44 PM - Alex Starr: Um I probably wind up insulting an astonishing portion of the population answering that one
3/14/19, 8:48 PM - Alex Starr: So I‚Äôll go with: who am I to speculate on what our priorities should be?
3/14/19, 8:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: I mean I see your concern but if you have to be prepared to insult people to discuss ideas and ask the right questions clearly
3/14/19, 8:50 PM - Alex Starr: I used to be
3/14/19, 8:50 PM - Alex Starr: But discussion is fruitless and being right only matters if you can enforce your correct decision
3/14/19, 8:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: Strong conclusions
3/14/19, 8:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: Why is discussion fruitless?
3/14/19, 8:51 PM - Alex Starr: I‚Äôd say the former more than the latter is false
3/14/19, 8:52 PM - Alex Starr: Let me rephrase
3/14/19, 8:52 PM - Alex Starr: Discussion that produces no change is fruitless
3/14/19, 8:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: Because I could see situations where that is true but I think it would depend on who you are talking to
3/14/19, 8:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: yes but you obviously can't fix problems in a binary way
3/14/19, 8:53 PM - Alex Starr: Binary way?
3/14/19, 8:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: I agree that being right only matters if you can enforce your understanding
3/14/19, 8:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: binary in that change can only happen all at once or not at all. and anything in between is an exercise in futility. But you might say there are more efficient ways to go about change than discussing a problem, that lead to better results, but not everyone sees themselves in that position and but maybe if you convinced everyone to think that discussion without was pointless by using discussion, you could produce a large effect
3/14/19, 8:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: discussion without positive change*
3/14/19, 8:59 PM - Alex Starr: This is might not be what I meant
3/14/19, 8:59 PM - Alex Starr: I mean being right doesn‚Äôt matter, getting people to act in accordance with what you think is right does
3/14/19, 9:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: How do you distinguish the two statements?
3/14/19, 9:40 PM - Alex Starr: Avoiding red meat is good for the earth and prevents climate change, I don‚Äôt necessarily need to convince people of that, just need to get them to stop eating red meat via a carbon tax, lying my ass off saying it‚Äôs devil spawn, or some sort of threat
3/14/19, 9:40 PM - Alex Starr: Whether they think climate change is wrong or red meat contributes is irrelevant
3/14/19, 9:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ahh
3/14/19, 9:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yes that does make more sense
3/14/19, 10:27 PM - Matt Casali: I also heard a super good quote the other day
3/14/19, 10:28 PM - Matt Casali: It was something like: "Equity will always feel like oppression to the people with power"
3/14/19, 10:29 PM - Matt Casali: What you experienced in that classroom is what people without power feel all the tim
3/14/19, 10:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: I‚Äôm not sure what your implicating
3/14/19, 10:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: you‚Äôre
3/14/19, 10:35 PM - Jason Greenberg: Also I‚Äôve seen ‚Äúwhen you‚Äôre accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression‚Äù but I can‚Äôt find yours online
3/14/19, 10:37 PM - Alex Starr: I personally like ‚Äúthose who speak out against bigotry can only be bigots themselves‚Äù
3/14/19, 10:45 PM - Alex Starr: Tho nothing beats ‚Äúif wishes were dishes, we‚Äôd all cast nets‚Äù
3/14/19, 10:46 PM - Matt Casali: I usually just go to target
3/14/19, 10:47 PM - Matt Casali: That's what I meant
3/14/19, 10:47 PM - Matt Casali: Well it seems like you felt oppressed in the journalism class cause you didnt consider yourself a feminist
3/14/19, 10:48 PM - Alex Starr: Fishes* fuck autocorrect
3/14/19, 10:48 PM - Alex Starr: Can‚Äôt believe I butchered such a great quote
3/14/19, 10:50 PM - Alex Starr: I think he was more saying, so now he feels powerless great we just flipped things but nothing got better
3/14/19, 10:50 PM - Matt Casali: But we didnt flip things
3/14/19, 10:50 PM - Matt Casali: That's what I'm trying to point our
3/14/19, 10:50 PM - Matt Casali: *out
3/14/19, 10:51 PM - Matt Casali: And I think that's an archaic, twisted view of feminism
3/14/19, 10:51 PM - Alex Starr: Great so we didn‚Äôt flip things and Jason feels powerless
3/14/19, 10:51 PM - Alex Starr: So no improvement for women plus things got worse for a guy
3/14/19, 10:51 PM - Matt Casali: Who said theres no improvement
3/14/19, 10:51 PM - Matt Casali: Things just aren't flipped
3/14/19, 10:52 PM - Matt Casali: Its not one or the other
3/14/19, 10:52 PM - Matt Casali: I felt shitty when I didnt know if I was a feminist or not. I got called out for using the wrong pronouns for someone once. It feels bad
3/14/19, 10:53 PM - Matt Casali: But doesnt mean things have gone too far
3/14/19, 10:53 PM - Matt Casali: Doesnt mean society as a whole has marginalized me
3/14/19, 10:54 PM - Matt Casali: And I'm sure being singled out by a whole class (especially a journalism class cause those kids were ruthless) was scary and isolating, but you have to realize that it's not a totalitarian movement just because of an experience at mvhs.
3/14/19, 10:55 PM - Matt Casali: Also, there's plenty wrong with how mvhs handled feminism
3/14/19, 10:55 PM - Parker: tldr
3/14/19, 10:55 PM - Matt Casali: Not saying they're entirely out of the swamp here
3/14/19, 10:57 PM - Parker: can someone summarize
3/14/19, 10:59 PM - Alex Starr: ‚ÄúIf wishes were fishes, we‚Äôd all cast nets‚Äù
3/14/19, 10:59 PM - Alex Starr: Summarized
3/14/19, 11:00 PM - Matt Casali: One more thing, cause I think this convo has gotten too convoluted and messed up:
3/14/19, 11:00 PM - Matt Casali: You guys are trying to analyze data to assess this problem, which is definitely part of the solution, but definitely not all of ut
3/14/19, 11:01 PM - Matt Casali: There's a lot to be said about stories and better yet,  corroborated stories
3/14/19, 11:01 PM - Matt Casali: Just like listen to people talk about this
3/14/19, 11:01 PM - Alex Starr: And little of it good
3/14/19, 11:01 PM - Parker: no
3/14/19, 11:01 PM - Matt Casali: It makes me honestly really sad to read these messages
3/14/19, 11:01 PM - Matt Casali: Gn y'all I'll see ya later
3/14/19, 11:02 PM - Alex Starr: Damn it Parker
3/14/19, 11:02 PM - Alex Starr: Ya made Matt sad
3/14/19, 11:02 PM - Alex Starr: Seems like a classic note to end it on, Matt upset and tho I‚Äôm usually more than happy to take the blame
3/14/19, 11:20 PM - Parker: Hahaha true
3/15/19, 7:09 AM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
3/15/19, 7:11 AM - Jason Greenberg: Dude in the factual realm science is king, that‚Äôs not a despute if this is the argument you‚Äôre making
3/15/19, 7:12 AM - Jason Greenberg: I don‚Äôt know how this helps your argument I think may undermine it a bit
3/15/19, 9:23 AM - Matt Casali: We should be done talking about this
3/15/19, 9:29 AM - Alex Starr: I think you mean agree to disagree
3/15/19, 9:30 AM - Matt Casali: That's what I was looking for
3/15/19, 9:30 AM - Matt Casali: Thank you
3/15/19, 9:30 AM - Alex Starr: I could‚Äôve sworn you hated ‚Äúagree to disagree‚Äù
3/15/19, 9:30 AM - Alex Starr: Or have you come around on it?
3/15/19, 9:37 AM - Parker: yeah wait what
3/15/19, 9:38 AM - Parker: i thought that was your least favorite phrase
3/15/19, 9:38 AM - Jason Greenberg: It is a contradiction if that‚Äôs true
3/15/19, 10:24 AM - Ricky: Hahaha I like it with dishes
3/15/19, 10:31 AM - Ricky: Also grace thinks Barry looks like Dwight üòÇüòÇüòÇ
3/15/19, 11:33 AM - Parker: Lol
3/15/19, 11:35 AM - Jason Greenberg: That is not something I would agree to disagree about
3/15/19, 11:35 AM - Jason Greenberg: Barry is one of a kind
3/15/19, 11:37 AM - Tim Ko: üòÇ
3/15/19, 11:37 AM - Tim Ko: That makes alex Phillip
3/15/19, 11:37 AM - Jason Greenberg: HAHAHAHA
3/15/19, 11:38 AM - Jason Greenberg: Gdi üòÇüòÇ
3/15/19, 11:39 AM - Jason Greenberg: Phillip was a large baby
3/15/19, 12:06 PM - Alex Starr: I don‚Äôt really see it
3/15/19, 12:22 PM - Parker: hahahaha
3/15/19, 1:13 PM - Vaughn: Whos Phillip?
3/15/19, 1:30 PM - Ricky: Dwight and Angela bb
3/15/19, 1:30 PM - Ricky: It‚Äôs prob just the forehead haha
3/19/19, 1:16 PM - Matt Casali: The Pillsburry Dough Boy is a sub
3/19/19, 1:16 PM - Matt Casali: Evolutionary biologists and neuroscientists believe that we laugh when we are tickled because the part of the brain that tells us to laugh when we experience a light touch, the hypothalamus, is also the same part that tells us to expect a painful sensation. Laughing when tickled in our sensitive spots (under the arms, near the throat and under our feet) could be a defensive mechanism. Research suggests that we have evolved to send this signal out to show our submission to an aggressor, to dispel a tense situation and prevent us from getting hurt.
3/19/19, 1:29 PM - Alex Starr: But we also have no clue in fuck if that‚Äôs actually the case
3/19/19, 1:30 PM - Matt Casali: I feel like it gives me some sense of comfort knowing that about the pillsbury dough boy
3/19/19, 1:35 PM - Alex Starr: I meant the evolutionary bit
3/19/19, 1:35 PM - Alex Starr: I don‚Äôt doubt for a second the veracity of the first claim
3/19/19, 1:41 PM - Tim Ko: Nah the cingulate cortex tells us to expect a painful experience
3/19/19, 1:41 PM - Tim Ko: Gang I got that psych midterm tomorrow
3/19/19, 1:41 PM - Tim Ko: Also FYI if u remove the cingulate cortex u can still ‚Äúfeel‚Äù the pain but it won‚Äôt bother u
3/19/19, 2:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: Light touch is Pacinian‚Äôs corpuscles projecting to hypothalamus and then primary somatosensory cortex biopsych final on Thursday gang
3/19/19, 3:09 PM - Tim Ko: Gang gang
3/19/19, 3:10 PM - Tim Ko: Uhhh no, light touch is meissner‚Äôs corpsule
3/19/19, 3:10 PM - Tim Ko: Pacinian is stretch
3/19/19, 3:10 PM - Tim Ko: Also good luck on ur final!
3/19/19, 3:10 PM - Tim Ko: Also I feel like we learned basically the same things in our classes lol
3/19/19, 3:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: Damnit you‚Äôre right
3/19/19, 3:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lol we‚Äôll have to compare
3/19/19, 3:18 PM - Alex Starr: This conversation has inspired me to make my lab not neuroanatomy
3/19/19, 3:21 PM - Tim Ko: This psych class has also helped me for the mcat so much
3/19/19, 3:22 PM - Alex Starr: You‚Äôve already studied what has to be 100 hours for it and aren‚Äôt taking it for another few months
3/19/19, 3:22 PM - Alex Starr: I think you might‚Äôve gotten there without it haha
3/19/19, 3:46 PM - Tim Ko: Ya but it‚Äôs kind like 2 birds one stone
3/19/19, 3:47 PM - Alex Starr: Tho in a way barring a sudden pivot to neurosurgery they are birds you‚Äôd rather not have to kill
3/19/19, 4:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: I‚Äôve got a bird for ya
3/19/19, 4:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: üñï
3/19/19, 4:35 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah probably was a bit harsh
3/19/19, 4:35 PM - Alex Starr: My bad
3/19/19, 4:35 PM - Alex Starr: Also Matt now I want to take physics classes
3/20/19, 11:44 AM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
3/20/19, 12:03 PM - Alex Starr: Math too
3/20/19, 12:03 PM - Alex Starr: The number of things called phi is astonishing
3/20/19, 12:08 PM - Alex Starr: That and the whole ‚Äò notation
3/20/19, 12:12 PM - Alex Starr: We went through half a discussion convinced we were talking about the derivative when it was actually the dual space
3/20/19, 12:25 PM - Matt Casali: Something weird:
3/20/19, 12:26 PM - Matt Casali: It's a practical law that nature abhors change and will always try to reach equilibrium
3/20/19, 12:26 PM - Matt Casali: Wait nvm
3/20/19, 12:26 PM - Matt Casali: I was gonna say that doesnt make sense with increasing entropy
3/20/19, 12:26 PM - Matt Casali: But nvm haha
3/20/19, 12:26 PM - Matt Casali: Ignore me
4/3/19, 10:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: We did some perception today and I had known that our photoreceptors are at the back of the eye behind a bunch of stuff but it never really clicked that they‚Äôre blocking the receptors and our brains just habituate to it. Then the prof showed us how to shine a light in your eye to see the blood vessels in front of the retina
4/3/19, 10:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: Insane
4/3/19, 10:44 PM - Parker: w0ah

5/13/19, 12:36 PM - Vaughn: Dreams and shit?
5/13/19, 12:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: For people not Alex and maybe Tim, when you visualize a dog for example in your mind, we‚Äôve found with brain scans that approximately the same regions light up as when you see that image in real life
5/13/19, 12:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: Using math and computation you could in theory map (with a healthy amount of error) what someone is picturing in their head
5/13/19, 12:37 PM - Tim Ko: That‚Äôs pretty cool
5/13/19, 12:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: Well if dreams follow the same principles as someone being told to visualize an image in a lab
5/13/19, 12:38 PM - Tim Ko: Medial pre frontal cortex activated when u are rehearsing motor movements
5/13/19, 12:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: Sounds right haha
5/13/19, 12:38 PM - Tim Ko: ^that will be on my final tomorrow
5/13/19, 12:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: Good luck on that my dude
5/13/19, 12:39 PM - Tim Ko: *pre motor
5/13/19, 12:39 PM - Tim Ko: Thx
5/13/19, 12:39 PM - Tim Ko: But anyways, I guess now we can read people‚Äôs minds?
5/13/19, 12:39 PM - Alex Starr: Incredibly noisily
5/13/19, 12:40 PM - Tim Ko: I guess just for objects and stuff
5/13/19, 12:40 PM - Tim Ko: Maybe not so much abstract
5/13/19, 12:40 PM - Alex Starr: Like, well he might be visualizing a dog but there‚Äôs only a 5% chance
5/13/19, 12:40 PM - Tim Ko: Still cool nonetheless
5/13/19, 12:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: I said healthy amount of error
5/13/19, 12:40 PM - Alex Starr: Ik
5/13/19, 12:40 PM - Alex Starr: It is cool
5/13/19, 12:41 PM - Alex Starr: But so noisy
5/13/19, 12:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: Aren‚Äôt fmri‚Äôs using a lot of approximations to map measure in the first place?
5/13/19, 12:43 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah it‚Äôs all extremely approximate I think
5/13/19, 12:44 PM - Alex Starr: Fun fact, if you hook up a bunch of sensors to a rat and then train it to lick left or lick right based on a signal, you can predict which way it will lick with decent accuracy
5/13/19, 12:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: Dope
5/13/19, 12:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: That‚Äôs dope as hell
5/13/19, 12:47 PM - Alex Starr: Ya it‚Äôs what that stanford professor I met with did
5/13/19, 12:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: Could a further direction of that study be to attempt to influence it to lick a certain direction without signal? If you stimulate the approximate areas
5/13/19, 12:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: That you‚Äôve identified
5/13/19, 12:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: That‚Äôd be insane if you got to work with him
5/13/19, 12:48 PM - Alex Starr: Oh they can probably do that but that‚Äôs not what they‚Äôre interested in I think.  Do you know what optogenetics?
5/13/19, 12:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: No
5/13/19, 12:49 PM - Alex Starr: Ik, I want to get in so bad
5/13/19, 12:49 PM - Alex Starr: Google it real quick it‚Äôll knock your shoes socks maybe even feet off
5/13/19, 12:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha ok
5/13/19, 12:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: Holy fuck
5/13/19, 12:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: That got an audible whoa from me
5/13/19, 12:52 PM - Alex Starr: Right?
5/13/19, 12:52 PM - Alex Starr: So they definitely can force it to do stuff
5/13/19, 12:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: This is insanely cutting edge wow
5/13/19, 12:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: I see what you mean
5/13/19, 12:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: Well beginning to see
5/13/19, 12:55 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah so we now have an a lot of increasingly high quality data and experimental methods, but completely lack a theoretical framework for how the brain does cognition/computing
5/13/19, 12:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: An exciting time to be a researcher
5/13/19, 1:02 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah I was gonna ask are you sure you don‚Äôt wanna be a researcher? But actually, what about clinical psych makes it much more appealing than research for you?
5/13/19, 1:23 PM - Tim Ko: U should do med school Jason
5/13/19, 1:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: I think it learning about certain topics is awesome, but I like applied psych and counseling better
5/13/19, 1:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: Pass but I‚Äôm stoked for you
5/13/19, 1:57 PM - Tim Ko: Haha aight if u ever change ur mind, hit me up
5/13/19, 2:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: Second part of the question: The skills that come with training to be a clinical psychologist feel more strongly useful and important to my life, and it‚Äôs a way of closely combining my interest in people with purpose and a fat salary
5/13/19, 2:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: Plus crazy flexibility means I can be get really into athletic stuff or be involved more with my kids
5/13/19, 2:21 PM - Tim Ko: Fat salary being the key
6/2/19, 8:03 AM - Alex Starr: Random but researchers have apparently discovered an archaea that divides in 3.
6/2/19, 8:33 AM - Jason Greenberg: Ohh
6/2/19, 8:33 AM - Jason Greenberg: What are the implications
6/2/19, 8:36 AM - Alex Starr: Basically nil idk haha
6/2/19, 8:36 AM - Alex Starr: I didn‚Äôt read much about it
7/1/19, 10:02 AM - Matt Casali: https://youtu.be/ug2bKCG4gZY
7/1/19, 10:02 AM - Matt Casali: The most satisfying thing I've ever seen
7/25/19, 8:27 PM - Vaughn: You can't spell advertisements without semen between the tits
7/25/19, 8:28 PM - Alex Starr: All of humanity summed up in 10 words
7/25/19, 8:32 PM - Alex Starr: Tho sell instead of spell would‚Äôve been better imo
7/25/19, 8:32 PM - Vaughn: Hahaha truuueee
7/25/19, 8:33 PM - Vaughn: Turns out you also cant spell American Dream without Eric Andre
7/25/19, 8:33 PM - Alex Starr: That one isn‚Äôt doing it for me.  I am not a big fan of his work.
7/25/19, 8:42 PM - Vaughn: You'll be hooked after the second youtube compilation
7/25/19, 9:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: This is excellent
7/25/19, 9:50 PM - Parker: incorrect
7/29/19, 11:13 AM - Parker: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/asteroid-just-misses-earth-city-killer-asteroid-2019-ok-came-closer-to-the-earth-than-moon/
7/29/19, 11:13 AM - Parker: did u guys see this lol
7/29/19, 11:21 AM - Tim Ko: I knew I saw something in the sky when we were at Collins on sat night
7/29/19, 11:27 AM - Parker: wait actually ? lol
7/29/19, 11:33 AM - Tim Ko: Nah I‚Äôm jokin haha
7/29/19, 11:35 AM - Parker: Haha it sounded a little believable
7/29/19, 12:51 PM - Alex Starr: Could barely have seen it with binoculars
8/8/19, 1:19 PM - Jason Greenberg: Shot in the dark but does anyone understand evolution through the lens of thermodynamics
8/8/19, 1:19 PM - Jason Greenberg: Maybe matt alex or tim
8/8/19, 1:22 PM - Tim Ko: Nope
8/8/19, 2:02 PM - Matt Casali: Maybe entropy??
8/8/19, 2:02 PM - Alex Starr: Are you treating individuals as particles then doing particle filtering?  Like statistical physics stuff?
8/8/19, 2:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: I don‚Äôt understand what particle filtering is so idk. I‚Äôm trying to understand the emerging properties of particles at higher and higher levels of organization and how life can exist thermodynamically
8/8/19, 2:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ie. How is evolution justified by physics
8/8/19, 2:10 PM - Alex Starr: Like how can entropy seem to decrease?
8/8/19, 2:13 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz it‚Äôs just that life increases entropy more outside itself than it decreases it
8/8/19, 2:16 PM - Alex Starr: But I‚Äôm still not sure what you‚Äôre asking.  Is there a paper or something you read that prompted this?
8/8/19, 2:27 PM - Alex Starr: https://www.quantamagazine.org/seeing-emergent-physics-behind-evolution-20170831/
8/8/19, 2:28 PM - Alex Starr: This is cool and semi related
8/8/19, 2:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: That‚Äôs pretty much it
8/8/19, 2:40 PM - Tim Ko: I can tell u about small molecule dyes
8/8/19, 2:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: I actually watched that interview
8/8/19, 2:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: It is cool
8/8/19, 2:41 PM - Alex Starr: We break down the world around us so we can be pockets of lower entropy
8/8/19, 2:42 PM - Alex Starr: With the Monte Carlo showing how our genetic code is optimal?
8/8/19, 4:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: The vid ended before that I‚Äôm reading the article now
8/8/19, 5:58 PM - Alex Starr: That‚Äôs the kinda thing that would be so cool to work on
8/8/19, 7:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: I agree minus your cs perspective
8/8/19, 7:28 PM - Alex Starr: First have to get a third rec letter which is looking iffy
8/8/19, 7:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: What are you first two?
10/15/19, 12:18 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
10/15/19, 12:29 PM - Vaughn: Huehue ners
10/15/19, 12:29 PM - Vaughn: *nerd
10/15/19, 12:29 PM - Alex Starr: What does it being ultra relativistic have to do with the earth being flat
10/15/19, 1:06 PM - Matt Casali: Length contraction at ultrarelativistic speeds would make something like the earth seem to have like no depth
10/15/19, 1:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: <Media omitted>
10/15/19, 1:22 PM - Matt Casali: More than sure
10/15/19, 1:28 PM - Alex Starr: Oh that‚Äôs underwhelming
10/15/19, 1:29 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah
12/10/19, 7:47 PM - Matt Casali: https://youtu.be/dqwpQarrDwk
What do y'all think about this?
12/10/19, 8:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: I've seen this it looks dope
12/10/19, 8:42 PM - Matt Casali: Like a very legitimate and cheap way to travel
12/10/19, 8:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: I know nothing about space travel stuff tho so I'm not much of an evaluator
12/10/19, 8:43 PM - Matt Casali: I mean they covered all the physics related problems I could think of
12/10/19, 8:45 PM - Alex Starr: I thought we didn‚Äôt have strong enough material yet
12/10/19, 8:48 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah that could be a problem, but the video said we were there and they're pretty good about their research usually
12/10/19, 8:53 PM - Alex Starr: It‚Äôs also a problem if it fails
12/10/19, 8:53 PM - Alex Starr: 1000 km of metal slamming down
12/10/19, 8:53 PM - Alex Starr: Plus the zoning laws
12/10/19, 8:54 PM - Matt Casali: It would definitely suck
12/10/19, 8:55 PM - Matt Casali: But the ideas of setting up mars' moons as stations was really cool to me
12/10/19, 9:00 PM - Alex Starr: What was estimated cost?
12/12/19, 1:58 AM - Tim Ko: https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34290981
12/12/19, 7:23 AM - Matt Casali: That's actually super cool
1/15/20, 6:02 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
1/15/20, 9:10 PM - Tim Ko: Ooo is this the research u are doing??
1/15/20, 11:42 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah!
1/16/20, 1:06 PM - Tim Ko: That‚Äôs cool man!
1/16/20, 1:37 PM - Matt Casali: Thanks I'll update y'all when I have more to report haha
1/16/20, 3:26 PM - Alex Starr: Hey guys, just wanted to let you know that I inhaled some chlorine gas (really nasty).  I went to the doctor and outside of chest pain feel fine.  Doctor said it should get better in a couple days, but I figured letting you guys know made sense?
1/16/20, 3:27 PM - Parker: Oh shit
1/16/20, 3:27 PM - Parker: Glad you‚Äôre okay mane
1/16/20, 3:28 PM - Ricky: Yeah, glad you‚Äôre doing okay boi
1/16/20, 3:28 PM - Vaughn: Oh gosh did that happen in a lab?
1/16/20, 3:28 PM - Vaughn: Thanks for tellin
1/16/20, 3:31 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah in lab.  So it‚Äôs the right chat
1/16/20, 3:32 PM - Parker: that‚Äôs the most important thing
1/16/20, 3:40 PM - Alex Starr: Always
1/16/20, 3:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: Holy fuck thanks for letting us know
1/16/20, 3:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: Do you need to do anything?
1/16/20, 3:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: Why this chat is the real question
1/16/20, 3:49 PM - Ricky: Any potential imperfection to Barry‚Äôs offspring must be documented here
1/16/20, 3:49 PM - Alex Starr: It‚Äôs science
1/16/20, 3:49 PM - Alex Starr: Or was in the process of science
1/16/20, 3:49 PM - Alex Starr: And no I‚Äôm cleared to work
1/16/20, 3:53 PM - Ricky: Glad to hear it
1/16/20, 3:53 PM - Ricky: What were you working on/ are working on?
1/16/20, 3:55 PM - Alex Starr: Cleaning up for a safety inspection haha
1/16/20, 3:55 PM - Alex Starr: But what I‚Äôve been doing is running the samples on the mass spectrometer.  About 1/3 of the way through then it‚Äôs a metric ton of data analysis
1/16/20, 3:56 PM - Ricky: Hahahahaha, inspection successful?
1/16/20, 3:56 PM - Ricky: And dang dats cool and then quickly less cool
1/16/20, 4:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: What is this, be from Japan day?
1/16/20, 4:20 PM - Tim Ko: Damn dude glad to know ur getting better
1/16/20, 4:22 PM - Tim Ko: At first I thought it was in our apartment. But given how old that building is, not out of the question lol
1/16/20, 5:12 PM - Matt Casali: Cool science shit
1/16/20, 5:13 PM - Matt Casali: And sounds scary, I'm glad you're okay
1/16/20, 5:46 PM - Alex Starr: Haha.  It was cuz the medical stuff falls under worker‚Äôs compensation and they asked if I wanted to take the rest of the day off
1/16/20, 5:57 PM - Alex Starr: The doctor in the room next to me was insistently telling his patient something along the lines of ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt China, it was a dog park, that dog that bit you had an owner and didn‚Äôt have rabies‚Äù.  Apparently it‚Äôs a real concern in other countries.
1/17/20, 3:07 PM - Alex Starr: Also whoever the admin is, add Darren to this chat
1/17/20, 3:10 PM - Alex Starr: @16502079920
1/17/20, 4:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: I think he left of his own accord
1/17/20, 4:34 PM - Jason Greenberg added Darren
1/17/20, 4:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: Collin is also not in it
1/17/20, 4:36 PM - Vaughn: Damn darren youve been missing out on a lot of cool science shit
1/17/20, 4:37 PM - Darren: Apparently
1/17/20, 4:38 PM - Darren: Like Alex "accidentally" recreating German world war 1 research
1/17/20, 4:39 PM - Darren: I super approve of the chat picture
1/17/20, 6:25 PM - Tim Ko: Haha
1/27/20, 3:32 PM - Alex Starr: Apparently getting enough sleep but having a late sleep schedule is associated with disease.  Though most effects are seen with too little sleep plus late sleep schedule I think
1/27/20, 3:32 PM - Darren: Fuck
1/27/20, 3:32 PM - Darren: I'm dying
1/27/20, 3:33 PM - Darren: It's been nice knowing ya
1/27/20, 3:33 PM - Parker: Lol
1/27/20, 3:33 PM - Darren: Fun while it lasted
1/27/20, 3:37 PM - Alex Starr: It‚Äôs not too late
1/27/20, 3:37 PM - Alex Starr: Also just brought it up cuz one of the caltech profs who I was assigned does circadian rhythm stuff (this is how cells, animals, plants, fungi keep track of time)
1/27/20, 3:47 PM - Tim Ko: This 100% fits my moms agenda
1/27/20, 3:47 PM - Tim Ko: I believe it tho
1/27/20, 3:47 PM - Tim Ko: Sleeping from 12-8 feels so much better than 3-11
1/27/20, 3:48 PM - Parker: I disagree
1/27/20, 3:48 PM - Parker: waking up at 8 sucks
1/27/20, 3:48 PM - Darren: ^
1/27/20, 3:48 PM - Parker: regardless of when you went to bed
1/27/20, 3:49 PM - Alex Starr: There‚Äôs a huge amount of healthy variation.
1/27/20, 3:49 PM - Alex Starr: But like 3-11 is rough.
1/27/20, 3:49 PM - Alex Starr: And 3-9 is really really bad
1/27/20, 3:49 PM - Darren: 3-11 is the way
1/27/20, 3:50 PM - Alex Starr: You‚Äôre not European, but a mutation was recently found that forces ‚Äúeveningness‚Äù is going to bed late
1/27/20, 3:50 PM - Tim Ko: Ok 12:30-9:30 is perfect
1/27/20, 3:51 PM - Darren: What
1/27/20, 3:52 PM - Parker: ^
1/27/20, 3:52 PM - Alex Starr: Idk they called it eveningness for some goddamn reason.  But the gist is that people with this mutation have trouble going to sleep before like 1:00 AM even if they didn‚Äôt sleep much.  Leads to some increases in risk for disease
1/27/20, 3:53 PM - Tim Ko: How bout for ppl with a flipped circadian rhythm
1/27/20, 3:54 PM - Tim Ko: Like ppl who work graveyard all their lives
1/27/20, 3:54 PM - Alex Starr: Idk
1/27/20, 3:54 PM - Alex Starr: It probably isn‚Äôt good
1/27/20, 3:55 PM - Alex Starr: But if you‚Äôre in the dark, eat regularly etc. but things are just flipped it might not be too bad
1/27/20, 3:55 PM - Darren: I imagine it's more about losing sleep than lack of sun
1/27/20, 3:56 PM - Darren: And people who wake up at 11 are just more likely on average to sleep less
1/27/20, 3:56 PM - Alex Starr: Nah the brightness resets your clock to some extent.  Plenty of sleep but out of sync with the clock is bad
1/27/20, 3:56 PM - Darren: Ok, but why
1/27/20, 3:57 PM - Alex Starr: Why does it reset or why is it bad?
1/27/20, 3:57 PM - Darren: Why is it bad
1/27/20, 3:57 PM - Darren: Like, why does it cause you to be more likely for diseases
1/27/20, 3:59 PM - Alex Starr: I don‚Äôt think they really know, I‚Äôll read that section.  I kinda skimmed it cuz don‚Äôt care about disease much
1/27/20, 4:02 PM - Alex Starr: It‚Äôs mostly just links that have been established not reasons.  But as an example, you‚Äôre pancreas could release insulin in a way that is partially dependent on this cycle.  If it‚Äôs off, you might release insulin abnormally potentially leading to diabetes.  An easier one is in bacteria, you would want to replicate your DNA at night because the light leads to a higher mutation rate
1/27/20, 4:05 PM - Alex Starr: But the biggest thing is that the shift in your clock doesn‚Äôt need to be the same for all organs if things get screwed up.  So if your heart is out of sync with your liver is out of sync with your pancreas, that‚Äôs bad
1/27/20, 4:05 PM - Alex Starr: The brain tries to control it but shit happens
1/27/20, 4:06 PM - Darren: Huh
1/27/20, 4:06 PM - Darren: ^
1/27/20, 4:06 PM - Tim Ko: I think ur immune system is on a rhythm and relies on u to sleep at a certain time of the rhythm to release certain cells
1/27/20, 4:08 PM - Tim Ko: But I‚Äôm wondering what if ur rhythm is from 3-11pm?
1/27/20, 4:08 PM - Tim Ko: 3-11 am
1/27/20, 4:08 PM - Alex Starr: But you shift the rhythm, it doesn‚Äôt shift perfectly
1/27/20, 4:09 PM - Darren: Do white people have worse rhythm?
1/27/20, 4:09 PM - Darren: Rhythm is the weirdest word
1/27/20, 4:09 PM - Alex Starr: It‚Äôs a mess
1/27/20, 4:09 PM - Tim Ko: That‚Äôs true
1/27/20, 4:09 PM - Alex Starr: And the input of light while asleep and darkness while awake exacerbates errors because that light partially sets your brain‚Äôs clock which alters other stuff
1/27/20, 4:10 PM - Tim Ko: I see, makes sense
1/27/20, 4:11 PM - Alex Starr: But things being out of sync and why it causes disease isn‚Äôt super understood, it‚Äôs only recently that they really nailed down how the clock works
1/27/20, 5:52 PM - Vaughn: Damn thats crazy
1/27/20, 5:54 PM - Vaughn: Could there be more correlations? Like muscle retention or injury proneness?
1/27/20, 6:15 PM - Alex Starr: Idk.  It seems to have really wide implications.  Muscles do have clocks too
2/26/20, 1:18 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
2/26/20, 1:29 PM - Alex Starr: Cichlids are dope
2/26/20, 1:29 PM - Parker: Lol
5/1/20, 7:16 PM - Alex Starr: So apparently people have wanted to figure out the basics of how the brain represents 3D space.  The way they tried to do it was to send rats into space so they would be in zero G and move around in 3D.  The astronauts didn't back up the data so it was all lost.  The people who actually solved the problem developed a way to record from neurons wirelessly in freely flying bat brains.
5/1/20, 7:20 PM - Vaughn: I am so confused
5/1/20, 7:21 PM - Alex Starr: Lol
5/1/20, 7:21 PM - Vaughn: How did the read the neurons
5/1/20, 7:21 PM - Vaughn: Like, what was the environment?
5/1/20, 7:21 PM - Vaughn: Im imagining rats floating in space
5/1/20, 7:21 PM - Alex Starr: Oh they can record their electricaly activity using an implant
5/1/20, 7:21 PM - Alex Starr: For the rats, you have a wired implant in their heads, then let them loose in zero G
5/1/20, 7:22 PM - Alex Starr: That is exactly it
5/1/20, 7:22 PM - Darren: Ratatouille meets Wall-E
5/1/20, 7:22 PM - Alex Starr: The bats went much better
5/1/20, 7:22 PM - Darren: That sounds like incredibly small hardware
5/1/20, 7:23 PM - Alex Starr: It weighs about 3 grams
5/1/20, 7:23 PM - Alex Starr: It is insanely small
5/1/20, 7:23 PM - Alex Starr: And the bats are around 150 grams
5/1/20, 7:23 PM - Alex Starr: So it doesn't impede them
5/1/20, 7:23 PM - Darren: What where the conclusions of the experiment?
5/1/20, 7:24 PM - Darren: Other than the development of the most specific hardware ever invented
5/1/20, 7:26 PM - Alex Starr: Hard to explain without being technical, but basically its exactly what you would expect.  A particular neuron fires when the bat is in a particular sphere of 3d space, just like how a neuron fires when we are in a particular circle of 2D space.  The other thing they showed is that there were two hypotheses for how these grids of firing regions are set up, and they disproved the easy to disprove hypothesis leaving us with the fucking impossible to study version
5/1/20, 7:27 PM - Darren: Does a bat's orientation in space relative to the floor affect the location/direction of neurons firing in the bat's brain (relative to its own body)?
5/1/20, 7:33 PM - Alex Starr: If I am parsing right, it does for what are called head direction cells I think
5/1/20, 7:34 PM - Alex Starr: They fire when your head is facing a certain direction.
5/1/20, 7:34 PM - Alex Starr: Idk if they have looked at them closely in bats though
5/1/20, 7:34 PM - Alex Starr: But in general for the grid cells from ^^^^^, no
5/1/20, 7:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: Whooooah dope
5/1/20, 7:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: V cool
5/1/20, 7:39 PM - Alex Starr: The other cool thing about bats is that they have a learned language, I think only elephants primates and bats do, and studying elephants or primates sucks balls.
5/1/20, 7:39 PM - Matt Casali: Bats are cool
5/1/20, 7:42 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah there‚Äôs a bat lab at Berkeley
5/1/20, 7:49 PM - Darren: So do different colonies of bat's have different languages?
5/1/20, 7:49 PM - Alex Starr: I have no idea and don‚Äôt think it is well studied
5/1/20, 7:49 PM - Alex Starr: Different colonies of birds have different songs
5/1/20, 7:49 PM - Darren: That is a goddamn travesty
5/1/20, 9:44 PM - Parker: Except in wuhan
5/1/20, 10:41 PM - Tim Ko: Why did they need to go to space to emulate 3D?
5/1/20, 10:41 PM - Tim Ko: Isn‚Äôt humans on earth in 3D?
5/2/20, 6:28 AM - Alex Starr: You walk around in 2D
5/2/20, 1:59 PM - Tim Ko: Could they have someone go up stairs or somehyping
5/2/20, 2:01 PM - Alex Starr: That‚Äôs 2D too
5/2/20, 2:01 PM - Alex Starr: Just tilted
5/2/20, 2:07 PM - Matt Casali: You could argue that for bats too though right? At any moment in time they're flying in a 2d plane
5/2/20, 2:09 PM - Darren: But the angle of the plane changes practically constantly where walking around is mostly uniform with the occasional shift
5/2/20, 2:17 PM - Alex Starr: ^
5/2/20, 2:17 PM - Alex Starr: Plus the data backs it up
5/2/20, 2:17 PM - Alex Starr: Bats have a 3D representation, mice on ramps don‚Äôt
5/2/20, 2:23 PM - Tim Ko: I see
5/2/20, 2:23 PM - Alex Starr: Mice in space is an open question
5/2/20, 2:24 PM - Alex Starr: I think a really interesting question would be dolphins
5/6/20, 8:37 PM - Tim Ko: Just wondering, would they have to expose test subjects to coronavirus when testing the vaccine?
5/6/20, 8:37 PM - Tim Ko: Cuz that would suck if the vaccine didn‚Äôt work
5/6/20, 8:38 PM - Tim Ko: I know they can measure antibody levels and stuff but wouldn‚Äôt the ultimate test before deeming it safe to the public be to expose someone to the actual virus?
5/6/20, 8:41 PM - Alex Starr: Idk
5/6/20, 10:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: Challenge testing, it‚Äôs not great but also will speed things up
5/6/20, 10:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: It‚Äôs being planned for idk if it‚Äôs approved yet

5/20/20, 6:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: big wuhwuht from me
5/20/20, 6:55 PM - Alex Starr: Same
5/20/20, 7:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: Good old channel 7 news boston blowing our collective hair back
5/20/20, 7:01 PM - Alex Starr: Lol
6/23/20, 2:23 PM - Tim Ko: Damn I‚Äôm just looking at corona cases in Spain and Italy and it‚Äôs so little now, where as america has gone up quite a bit since the summer started
6/23/20, 2:23 PM - Tim Ko: It went from like 5,000 to a few hundreds in Italy and Spain
6/23/20, 2:48 PM - Parker: Yeah we‚Äôre spiking like crazy
6/23/20, 2:48 PM - Parker: Crazy what happens when everyone follows the guidelines
6/23/20, 3:04 PM - Alex Starr: People are following the guidelines here in many cases, they‚Äôre just shit in a lot of areas
6/23/20, 3:07 PM - Parker: I wouldn‚Äôt say many
6/23/20, 3:08 PM - Alex Starr: I don‚Äôt think we really have evidence to say either way, and young people aren‚Äôt most people
6/23/20, 3:21 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah California is not the worst and that‚Äôs saying something since we have a lot of ppl and so cal is getting pretty bad
6/23/20, 3:24 PM - Parker: yeah i wasn‚Äôt really referencing california just a lot of areas across the country where people think it‚Äôs over or never took it seriously from the start
6/23/20, 3:26 PM - Darren: Luckily the poorly educated regions of the US tend to also be the poorly populated ones
6/23/20, 3:29 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah definitly
6/23/20, 3:35 PM - Alex Starr: Or unluckily.  We need higher attendance a trump rallies
6/23/20, 3:37 PM - Parker: ^
6/25/20, 1:37 PM - Tim Ko: Jeez California is up to 7,000 new cases
6/25/20, 1:37 PM - Tim Ko: Was hovering between 1,000-2,000 for the past couple months
6/25/20, 1:40 PM - Alex Starr: Ya it is not encouraging
6/25/20, 2:01 PM - Tim Ko: One silver lining is Bay Area only has increased by a few hundred
6/25/20, 2:01 PM - Tim Ko: Think LA is the one getting screwed
6/25/20, 2:07 PM - Alex Starr: Big time
6/25/20, 3:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: Nice
6/26/20, 7:42 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
6/26/20, 8:12 PM - Ricky: Damn, I know UCLA kids are getttimg it cuz they are doing apartment parties (graces camp mates still in apartments by campus are getting it or are surrounded by pple getting it
6/26/20, 8:15 PM - Parker: people at oregon are starting to too
6/26/20, 8:16 PM - Parker: a bunch of people i know uo there have been so bad about it
6/26/20, 8:17 PM - Parker: and apparently my friend Britnee was just in contact with someone who tested positive
6/26/20, 8:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeeesh
6/26/20, 8:54 PM - Parker: no bueno
6/26/20, 8:54 PM - Parker: luckily i was out of there before all that
7/2/20, 3:23 PM - Tim Ko: ‚ÄúThe friend told Macias (guy who died in the article) that he was aware of the diagnosis when he attended the gathering but that because he was not showing symptoms, he did not believe he could infect anyone else.‚Äù - quote from this article

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/us/politics/pentagon-ufo-harry-reid-navy.html?referringSource=articleShare
7/27/20, 8:32 PM - Darren: I made it less than a paragraph before being paywalled
7/27/20, 8:32 PM - Darren: TLDR?
7/27/20, 8:38 PM - Alex Starr: There is a pentagon program to investigate ufos, some claim there is evidence of materials man couldn‚Äôt make.  More information is forthcoming as things declassify.
7/27/20, 8:41 PM - Ricky: Dats wild
7/27/20, 8:41 PM - Ricky: Hopefully we get some cool shiz out of it
7/27/20, 8:45 PM - Darren: This could be what we need for real hover boards
7/27/20, 8:47 PM - Vaughn: Yeeeees
7/27/20, 8:47 PM - Vaughn: And maybe a dope ass sheild
