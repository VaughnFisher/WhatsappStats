5/4/17, 3:20 PM - Alex Starr: It does not have a connotation of laughter for me idk why
5/4/17, 3:20 PM - Alex Starr: Who's billy?
5/4/17, 3:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: That's a schema
5/4/17, 3:21 PM - Collin Hurst: Cosboi

5/4/17, 4:00 PM - Alex Starr: I prefer to warp in
5/4/17, 4:01 PM - Collin Hurst: Down B *ZORP*
5/4/17, 4:04 PM - Alex Starr: Baited it
5/15/17, 12:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Do you want kids?
5/15/17, 12:28 PM - Matt Casali: I feel like we've talked about this and then we all got mad at Alex
5/15/17, 12:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: What? What happened?
5/15/17, 12:29 PM - Parker: Any convo ever^^
5/15/17, 12:29 PM - Parker: I do jason
5/15/17, 12:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: How many?
5/15/17, 12:30 PM - Parker: That I'm undecided I think 2
5/15/17, 12:30 PM - Parker: I don't really want an only child
5/15/17, 12:30 PM - Parker: Cuz fuck those kids
5/15/17, 12:33 PM - Parker: How about u guys?
5/15/17, 12:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: <Media omitted>
5/15/17, 12:35 PM - Matt Casali: Yep
5/15/17, 12:36 PM - Parker: How was your carrot?
5/15/17, 12:36 PM - Tim Ko: I want kids too!
5/15/17, 12:36 PM - Tim Ko: I'll teach them how to ball
5/15/17, 12:36 PM - Matt Casali: Honestly it was pretty good but after the fifth one I realized the bad taste they had tasted like shit
5/15/17, 12:37 PM - Matt Casali: And then become like Matt Martin's parents tim?
5/15/17, 12:37 PM - Parker: Did u try sticking any of them up your butt?
5/15/17, 12:39 PM - Alex Starr: ^
5/15/17, 12:43 PM - Matt Casali: No I realized they had already been through that do I decided it would be more sanitary not to
5/15/17, 12:44 PM - Alex Starr: Everyone got pissed at me even tho I made it clear I wanted kids at some point lol
5/15/17, 12:45 PM - Alex Starr: And I agree doing an only child thing doesn't seem the best
5/15/17, 12:45 PM - Matt Casali: To be clear, I didn't get mad. Apparently, I just wanted a carrot
5/15/17, 12:46 PM - Alex Starr: It wasn't u that was coming down hard tho given we were talking about carrots and kids u were probably coming up a bit hard
5/15/17, 12:46 PM - Matt Casali: *thunderous applause*
5/15/17, 12:46 PM - Matt Casali: *standing ovation*
5/15/17, 12:47 PM - Matt Casali: _encore!_
5/15/17, 12:47 PM - Parker: Gang
5/15/17, 12:50 PM - Alex Starr: Glad you approved matt I thought it had a nice multi-tiered aspect to it
5/15/17, 12:52 PM - Matt Casali: I think co-planar is a better description
5/15/17, 12:53 PM - Alex Starr: Doesn't that mean in the same plane?
5/15/17, 12:55 PM - Matt Casali: Yes
5/15/17, 12:57 PM - Tim Ko: Lol about the matt Martin parents
5/15/17, 12:57 PM - Matt Casali: Living vicariously through their child and being the loudest about it
5/15/17, 12:58 PM - Tim Ko: Haha naaa I don't think I'd do that
5/15/17, 12:58 PM - Matt Casali: Neither did Matt Martin's parents
5/15/17, 12:58 PM - Matt Casali: Jk you wouldn't haha
5/15/17, 12:58 PM - Tim Ko: I'd teach them how to ball so then I can beat them in one v one
5/15/17, 12:59 PM - Parker: That's when u would need to reevaluate your life
5/15/17, 1:00 PM - Matt Casali: That's the spirit
5/15/17, 1:01 PM - Tim Ko: Haha
5/15/17, 1:01 PM - Alex Starr: I think if ur at that point reevaluation should've happened a while ago
5/15/17, 1:02 PM - Parker: ^
5/15/17, 1:02 PM - Tim Ko: I'm gonna be making so many trips to the hospital for my kids after I break their ankles so many times on the court
5/15/17, 1:03 PM - Alex Starr: I'm starting to think tim accused Parker of domestic abuse to cover for his own terrible actions
5/15/17, 1:04 PM - Parker: Ya think?
5/15/17, 1:04 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah have u noticed that we've never seen matt ko walking?
5/15/17, 1:05 PM - Tim Ko: They accuse me of domestic violence because if all the ankles I've broken gang
5/15/17, 1:05 PM - Tim Ko: *of
5/15/17, 1:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: Tim does hace a history of projection
5/15/17, 1:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: With his teasing of Parker
5/15/17, 1:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: We're gonna get him a girlfriend in 2020
5/15/17, 1:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: And Alex a baby in 2021
5/15/17, 1:56 PM - Parker: Woah
5/15/17, 1:56 PM - Parker: Baby can maybe be 2024
5/15/17, 2:15 PM - Alex Starr: Alright I should be working only around 20 hours per week front and backloaded
5/15/17, 2:16 PM - Alex Starr: My bad wrong chat
5/15/17, 2:20 PM - Tim Ko: Lol jason I learned about projection in psyc
5/15/17, 2:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ha
5/15/17, 2:21 PM - Tim Ko: I think that when I make fun of parker about girls it is a projection of myself
5/15/17, 2:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: That sounds right to me
5/15/17, 2:44 PM - Alex Starr: ^
5/15/17, 2:51 PM - Parker: Knew there was a term for it lol
5/15/17, 2:55 PM - Tim Ko: There's a term for everything
5/15/17, 3:02 PM - Parker: Mhm
5/21/17, 7:45 PM - McGuirk left
7/22/17, 5:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: I have no idea what to get Hayley for her birthday in 2 weeks
7/22/17, 5:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: Sos
7/22/17, 5:02 PM - Matt Casali: Write her a letter
7/22/17, 5:02 PM - Matt Casali: Go on a trip
7/22/17, 5:02 PM - Matt Casali: Buy her a nice item of clothing
7/22/17, 5:03 PM - Alex Starr: Two words
7/22/17, 5:03 PM - Alex Starr: Flavored condoms
7/22/17, 5:04 PM - Parker: I'm with matt
7/22/17, 5:04 PM - Matt Casali: Imo it should be something very unique to you or else it doesnt mean much.
7/22/17, 5:04 PM - Matt Casali: For example: kosher condoms
7/22/17, 5:05 PM - Alex Starr: Going all emersonian gift on her
7/22/17, 5:05 PM - Collin Hurst: The UltraVibratron 3000 with dual penetration, drip trays, and 6 different vibration patterns
7/22/17, 5:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha
7/22/17, 5:05 PM - Matt Casali: Thats where my idea came from alex
7/22/17, 5:05 PM - Matt Casali: Collin has done his research
7/22/17, 5:07 PM - Alex Starr: Get her something that involves psychology and economics
7/22/17, 5:07 PM - Alex Starr: Like a book
7/22/17, 5:15 PM - Matt Casali: Books can be really good gifts
7/22/17, 5:15 PM - Matt Casali: Its what I got fredi for her graduation
7/22/17, 5:15 PM - Vaughn: You had me at drip trays
7/22/17, 5:15 PM - Alex Starr: Assuming she likes to read
7/22/17, 5:15 PM - Alex Starr: No he had u at collin
7/22/17, 5:15 PM - Matt Casali: Also, her birthday is very close to fredis
7/22/17, 5:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: I like the letter idea
7/22/17, 5:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: I might also get her a hat?
7/22/17, 5:17 PM - Alex Starr: Maybe a letter and a book
7/22/17, 5:17 PM - Alex Starr: It's best to have something with monetary value
7/22/17, 5:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: I got her a book once but she didn't really like it
7/22/17, 5:18 PM - Jason Greenberg: When's Fredi's bday
7/22/17, 5:18 PM - Matt Casali: Today
7/22/17, 5:18 PM - Jason Greenberg: Zomg
7/22/17, 5:18 PM - Jason Greenberg: Tell her I say happy bday
7/22/17, 5:18 PM - Parker: Same
7/22/17, 5:19 PM - Matt Casali: Will do. Shes asleep right now but I'll text her later
7/22/17, 6:31 PM - Vaughn: bees?

7/22/17, 7:42 PM - Alex Starr: Free trial for the win
7/22/17, 7:58 PM - Parker: Dank brownies?
7/22/17, 7:58 PM - Alex Starr: No merely good
7/22/17, 8:09 PM - Tim Ko: Rogue one, tho I've already seen it but my parents haven't
7/22/17, 8:09 PM - Tim Ko: It's out on Netflix now
7/26/17, 8:29 PM - Tim Ko left
9/23/17, 12:21 AM - Matt Casali: I just experienced an amazing moment with Fredi where I felt so indescribably happy. Our relationship is undefined ahead of today, but for those moments and now, that seemed the way it should be. I became so intimately connected with her in those moments that (Im not sure if it was a dream that I had before hand) I stepped outside myself but felt in complete control, like each step I took was the best possible step I could take.
9/23/17, 12:21 AM - Matt Casali: Thats what intimacy is to me, in that poor description.
9/23/17, 12:22 AM - Matt Casali: Thats the most bliss that I've ever felt.
9/23/17, 12:22 AM - Ricky: I don't know what you are describing, but I'm happy for you bud :))))
9/23/17, 12:23 AM - Matt Casali: Thats all I could hope for, thank you rick
9/23/17, 12:23 AM - Matt Casali: I know my writing isnt concise at all
9/23/17, 12:23 AM - Matt Casali: Im going to go to sleep and dream about that
9/23/17, 12:24 AM - Vaughn: Did it just hit you like a train? Were you alone?
9/23/17, 12:24 AM - Matt Casali: No I was with Fredi
9/23/17, 12:24 AM - Matt Casali: I was talking with her about what I loved about our relationship
9/23/17, 12:25 AM - Vaughn: Did she feel similar?
9/23/17, 12:26 AM - Matt Casali: I know she felt really good. She knew how I felt. But I dont think she felt as good as me. But it doesnt even matter, I was just so happy
9/23/17, 12:27 AM - Matt Casali: I just felt like I was acting so fluidly
9/23/17, 12:27 AM - Matt Casali: Ahhh I wish I could explain this better!
9/23/17, 12:28 AM - Matt Casali: Goodnight guys
9/23/17, 12:30 AM - Vaughn: Goodnight!
9/23/17, 12:45 AM - Jason Greenberg: Night bud
9/23/17, 1:06 AM - Parker: Happy for u bud have a jolly ole night
9/23/17, 1:07 AM - Ricky: Gnight ❤
9/23/17, 9:29 AM - Alex Starr: Euphoric?
9/23/17, 10:23 AM - Tim Ko: That's awesome matt!!
9/23/17, 10:36 AM - Matt Casali: Thanks tim, and yeah alex
9/23/17, 10:36 AM - Matt Casali: I was intensely happy the whole time but euphoric for a couple moments in there as well
9/23/17, 1:00 PM - Alex Starr: What do u think was the proximate/ultimate cause(s)?
9/23/17, 1:03 PM - Matt Casali: After thinking about it Im sure thats it because I wasnt sure of what would happen
9/23/17, 1:04 PM - Matt Casali: When we hung out, it seemed more unique and unpredictable than anything else I had done
9/23/17, 1:04 PM - Matt Casali: Even though it wasnt anything amazingly special
9/23/17, 1:05 PM - Alex Starr: That's cool.  Probably some other factors in there that aren't worth going into.
9/23/17, 1:05 PM - Alex Starr: Any specific instances of unpredictability/spontaneity?
9/23/17, 1:08 PM - Alex Starr: Just trying to get a feel for what was going on.  I'm curious.
9/23/17, 1:08 PM - Alex Starr: If it's intruding on your intimacy feel free to issue a cease and desist
9/23/17, 1:12 PM - Matt Casali: Alex, I appreciate your interest and I wouldnt have started the conversation if I didnt want to go into it.
9/23/17, 1:12 PM - Alex Starr: Sweet
9/23/17, 1:13 PM - Matt Casali: I will answer when I can though, I got a lot of stuff to do today.
9/23/17, 1:14 PM - Alex Starr: Ah ok.  As an added bonus talking about things and thinking extensively about them helps cement memory
9/23/17, 1:15 PM - Matt Casali: Thats part of the reason I told you guys about it!
9/23/17, 1:16 PM - Matt Casali: I want to experience that again
9/23/17, 1:16 PM - Matt Casali: I wanna remember how
9/23/17, 1:16 PM - Alex Starr: Good call, and the relationshipless among us will try not to appear overly voyeuristic
9/23/17, 1:19 PM - Matt Casali: I looked it up and I would appreciate that
9/23/17, 1:19 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah I'm kidding about that part
9/23/17, 1:20 PM - Matt Casali: So you are going to appear voyeuristic?
9/23/17, 1:21 PM - Alex Starr: Nah I just won't be voyeuristic.  It's not really how I roll
9/23/17, 10:31 PM - Matt Casali: Without going into too much detail for your sake, the most specific time was when I was looking at her. My mind went blank and I started acting completely re-actively rather than anticipatory.
9/23/17, 10:32 PM - Alex Starr: But like anything specific?
9/23/17, 10:33 PM - Matt Casali: What exactly are you asking?
9/23/17, 10:33 PM - Alex Starr: I dunno
9/23/17, 10:33 PM - Alex Starr: Seems vague
9/23/17, 10:34 PM - Matt Casali: Hmmm
9/23/17, 10:34 PM - Alex Starr: Which is probably cuz whatever was going for u is difficult for u to define
9/23/17, 10:34 PM - Matt Casali: This is true
9/23/17, 10:35 PM - Alex Starr: But generally starting with the overly specific and building to generalities is best for this sorta thing
9/23/17, 10:35 PM - Matt Casali: Its also been a while and Ive been on an emotional roller coaster since then so my memories are very vague
9/23/17, 10:35 PM - Alex Starr: Why an emotional roller coaster? Are people dying?
9/23/17, 10:36 PM - Alex Starr: Or just dead for people without object permanence
9/23/17, 10:37 PM - Matt Casali: No but that happiness thing just threw me off guard and then fredi leaving is hard
9/23/17, 10:38 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah that's what my object permanence thing was attempting to poorly imply without being too upfront.
9/23/17, 10:38 PM - Alex Starr: How long did ur euphoria last?
9/23/17, 10:41 PM - Matt Casali: Barely any time
9/23/17, 10:41 PM - Alex Starr: Oh so the happiness was very brief?
9/23/17, 10:41 PM - Matt Casali: 15 seconds at most
9/23/17, 10:43 PM - Matt Casali: But the moments afterwards were like only a fraction less
9/23/17, 10:43 PM - Matt Casali: And that lasted much longsr
9/23/17, 10:44 PM - Alex Starr: What event or thought was most close in time to the spikes in happiness? Also did it start with a spike?
9/23/17, 10:46 PM - Matt Casali: I was drawn to her completely
9/23/17, 10:46 PM - Matt Casali: Thats all I remember really
9/23/17, 10:46 PM - Matt Casali: And no it was more like a rolling wave
9/23/17, 10:47 PM - Alex Starr: Ah so not much memory of it.  That's too bad.  Were u drunk/high?
9/23/17, 10:48 PM - Matt Casali: Nope
9/23/17, 10:48 PM - Matt Casali: Felt a little like it though
9/23/17, 10:49 PM - Alex Starr: Well I got nothing then
9/23/17, 10:49 PM - Alex Starr: Forever a mystery
9/23/17, 10:52 PM - Matt Casali: It was probably just a larger dopamine burst than I've experienced
9/23/17, 10:53 PM - Alex Starr: Well let's not get too much into brain chemistry.  I'm just curious about the cause.
9/23/17, 11:00 PM - Matt Casali: Im reading a book about it and Im getting to involved haha
9/23/17, 11:01 PM - Alex Starr: About brain chemistry? It's pretty cool
9/23/17, 11:07 PM - Matt Casali: How brain chemistry and a whole lot of other things influence behavior
9/23/17, 11:08 PM - Alex Starr: So how things influence brain chemistry?
9/23/17, 11:08 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz brain chemistry is for the most part behavior I think
9/23/17, 11:08 PM - Matt Casali: Yeeessss?
9/23/17, 11:08 PM - Matt Casali: Im tired
9/23/17, 11:10 PM - Alex Starr: Which chemicals cause that?
9/26/17, 11:35 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
10/3/17, 1:16 PM - Matt Casali: Minor dilemma that I would appreciate your guys' opinion on
10/3/17, 1:18 PM - Jason Greenberg: Whattup
10/3/17, 1:19 PM - Matt Casali: I've been very mildly considering transferring to UCSB next year. I would be able to do it with relative comfort and ease into mechanical engineering if I wanted to.
10/3/17, 1:20 PM - Matt Casali: Main things holding me back are 1) I dont know if I want to give up research opportunities for astrophysics right now
10/3/17, 1:20 PM - Alex Starr: Hardly minor
10/3/17, 1:21 PM - Matt Casali: Im in good standing with astrophysics and I could probably advance myself a lot
10/3/17, 1:21 PM - Matt Casali: However your chances of getting a job increase exponentially if you're a mechanical engineer and I enjoy mechanical engineering
10/3/17, 1:22 PM - Matt Casali: And I put this in this chat cause, you guessed it, Fredi is at UCSB and as much as I dont want it to its pulling me over there
10/3/17, 1:23 PM - Matt Casali: So I would have the benefit of seeing her way more often and developing a strong relationship
10/3/17, 1:23 PM - Matt Casali: But not if she doesnt want me there
10/3/17, 1:23 PM - Matt Casali: And theres no good way for me to ask her opinion without putting her in a horrible spot
10/3/17, 1:24 PM - Alex Starr: That's true but I think you have to ask her because it sounds like were you to move, it would in effect be for her.
10/3/17, 1:24 PM - Matt Casali: Oh btw Jason this is probably obvious but please dont say anything to Fredi
10/3/17, 1:24 PM - Alex Starr: Cause it seems like astrophysics>mech e
10/3/17, 1:24 PM - Matt Casali: How so?
10/3/17, 1:25 PM - Alex Starr: U like astrophysics more
10/3/17, 1:25 PM - Tim Ko: Astrophysics sounds sick
10/3/17, 1:25 PM - Alex Starr: At least judging by what you've said now and in the past
10/3/17, 1:26 PM - Matt Casali: I mean I would be able to go into physics there too
10/3/17, 1:26 PM - Alex Starr: Doesn't UCSB have sick astrophysics?
10/3/17, 1:26 PM - Matt Casali: But astrophysics is way better here
10/3/17, 1:26 PM - Alex Starr: Really?
10/3/17, 1:26 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah
10/3/17, 1:26 PM - Matt Casali: More resources
10/3/17, 1:26 PM - Alex Starr: Well then you have to ask fredi I think.
10/3/17, 1:27 PM - Matt Casali: That being said they're both pretty good
10/3/17, 1:27 PM - Alex Starr: Actually I think regardless u have to ask her
10/3/17, 1:29 PM - Alex Starr: Also honestly, people put way too much stock in what school has what program etc.  As an example, my dad went to Chico state.
10/3/17, 1:29 PM - Alex Starr: So that shouldn't be the main factor especially considering ucsc and UCSB are very similar in terms of physics clout
10/3/17, 1:33 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah thats true
10/3/17, 1:34 PM - Alex Starr: But u have to absolutely ask fredi I think
10/3/17, 1:35 PM - Matt Casali: I just dont know how to about doing thay
10/3/17, 1:35 PM - Matt Casali: *that
10/3/17, 1:36 PM - Alex Starr: That's a tricky one
10/3/17, 1:36 PM - Matt Casali: Well, I should see her and the campus I think
10/3/17, 1:37 PM - Alex Starr: I mean the campus is nice.  Would u be able to keep the Ames gig?
10/3/17, 1:37 PM - Alex Starr: See her to discuss I agree
10/3/17, 1:37 PM - Vaughn: I think a pros and cons without fredi in the equation would be a good start
10/3/17, 1:37 PM - Alex Starr: I strongly disagree
10/3/17, 1:38 PM - Vaughn: If thered more pros for ucsb than its a no brainer right?
10/3/17, 1:38 PM - Alex Starr: True but I think it would muddy the waters and I doubt that's the case
10/3/17, 1:38 PM - Alex Starr: Like basically no chance
10/3/17, 1:38 PM - Vaughn: Well yeah thered be bias
10/3/17, 1:38 PM - Vaughn: Buuuut its a start
10/3/17, 1:39 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah true
10/3/17, 1:39 PM - Collin Hurst: Jack off before you make any decisions
10/3/17, 1:40 PM - Alex Starr: Right but I think ucsc no fredi wins easy.  He gets to do dope dark matter research, stay close to friend(s) (plural based on caughn potential transfer) stay in a familiar campus he said he loves etc.
10/3/17, 1:40 PM - Collin Hurst: That's all I have to say
10/3/17, 1:40 PM - Alex Starr: A font of knowledge and sound advice per usual collin
10/3/17, 1:40 PM - Collin Hurst: Np
10/3/17, 1:40 PM - Alex Starr: But it's actually not the worst idea
10/3/17, 1:41 PM - Collin Hurst: Like the hardest work of your life
10/3/17, 1:41 PM - Collin Hurst: Get every nook and cranny of sexual tension out of your body
10/3/17, 1:41 PM - Collin Hurst: Wank^^*
10/3/17, 1:42 PM - Alex Starr: Well if u mean it like that then bad idea
10/3/17, 1:42 PM - Collin Hurst: At least 120 spm
10/3/17, 1:43 PM - Alex Starr: Matt would u be happier mech e no research with fredi at UCSB or astrophysics dark matter research fredi at UCSB u at ucsc?
10/3/17, 1:43 PM - Alex Starr: Just right now answer
10/3/17, 1:43 PM - Collin Hurst: After wanking at 120 spm Lowest
10/3/17, 1:44 PM - Vaughn: HURRY MATT!!
10/3/17, 1:50 PM - Matt Casali: I was talking to someone lo siento
10/3/17, 1:50 PM - Vaughn: Too late
10/3/17, 1:50 PM - Matt Casali: I dont know until I start doing researxh
10/3/17, 1:50 PM - Matt Casali: I may hate it
10/3/17, 1:50 PM - Matt Casali: The idea of it is cool
10/3/17, 1:51 PM - Matt Casali: But processing data may suck donkey balls
10/3/17, 1:51 PM - Vaughn: Wanking isnt that complicated
10/3/17, 1:51 PM - Alex Starr: Ok so research will kinda suck but you'll feel like ur contributing to something cool go
10/3/17, 1:51 PM - Matt Casali: Fredu
10/3/17, 1:51 PM - Matt Casali: I tried to type it fasy
10/3/17, 1:51 PM - Matt Casali: Shit
10/3/17, 1:51 PM - Vaughn: Spongeh Bobuuu
10/3/17, 1:51 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah so u need to talk to her
10/3/17, 1:51 PM - Matt Casali: But none of that matters if she wouldnt be happy with me there
10/3/17, 1:52 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz as expected you'd choose her no matter what basically
10/3/17, 1:52 PM - Alex Starr: Hence, talk to her
10/3/17, 1:52 PM - Collin Hurst: We didn't want to live with you junior year anyways gosh
10/3/17, 1:52 PM - Alex Starr: Thought u were headed to cal collin
10/3/17, 1:52 PM - Collin Hurst: If we go
10/3/17, 1:52 PM - Matt Casali: Thats actually a really strong reason why I wouldnt wanna go
10/3/17, 1:52 PM - Vaughn: So if fredi wasnt in the equation the obvious choice is sc
10/3/17, 1:52 PM - Matt Casali: Yes
10/3/17, 1:52 PM - Vaughn: Or is it still a little close?
10/3/17, 1:52 PM - Collin Hurst: It's like 40-60 alex
10/3/17, 1:53 PM - Matt Casali: No not at all vaughn
10/3/17, 1:53 PM - Matt Casali: Thing is I can visit her regardless
10/3/17, 1:53 PM - Alex Starr: But you'd follow fredi to the ends of the earth.  Even with all that you'd have to do tomake the earth flat
10/3/17, 1:54 PM - Vaughn: Have you had any conversation with her similar to the one you could be having?
10/3/17, 1:54 PM - Vaughn: Like her going to sc freshman year
10/3/17, 1:57 PM - Matt Casali: My independence is what concerns me
10/3/17, 1:57 PM - Matt Casali: For one, I need to be self-sustaining in case anything happens
10/3/17, 1:57 PM - Matt Casali: I also cant smother her
10/3/17, 1:57 PM - Matt Casali: And not really Vaughn
10/3/17, 1:58 PM - Matt Casali: It was her coming to my school not me going to hers
10/3/17, 1:58 PM - Alex Starr: Independence is overrated
10/3/17, 1:58 PM - Matt Casali: The dynamic of the relationship we have and the opportunities Im getting make those two convos way different
10/3/17, 1:59 PM - Matt Casali: Smothering is not healthy though
10/3/17, 1:59 PM - Alex Starr: All this is moot until u ask her
10/3/17, 1:59 PM - Matt Casali: Kills off relationships in the blink of an eye
10/3/17, 2:00 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz if she says yes I'd love to have u here then you'd go.  If she says I'd prefer we remain more independent, then you'd stay.
10/3/17, 2:00 PM - Alex Starr: So now it's about how to ask
10/3/17, 2:00 PM - Alex Starr: At least imo
10/3/17, 2:01 PM - Alex Starr: Or u could go the collin route, wank first ask questions later
10/3/17, 2:03 PM - Parker: Matt whatever your answer is ignoring fredi is what u should do
10/3/17, 2:03 PM - Parker: don't ask cuz fredi only has one choice lol
10/3/17, 2:03 PM - Alex Starr: What?
10/3/17, 2:05 PM - Parker: If u think ucsb can give u more in terms of research/physics stuff then go there and let fredi be an added bonus, if not then stay is my opinion
10/3/17, 2:05 PM - Parker: also, what collin said
10/3/17, 2:05 PM - Alex Starr: How does fredi only have 1 choice?
10/3/17, 2:05 PM - Parker: alex point is he shouldn't ask her
10/3/17, 2:05 PM - Parker: that puts her ina terrible spit
10/3/17, 2:06 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah but I'd argue that terrible spot is better than 
A. Matt just going to UCSB.
B. Matt just staying at UCSC.
10/3/17, 2:06 PM - Alex Starr: Assuming she feels similarly for matt how matt feels for her
10/3/17, 2:07 PM - Parker: I disagree
10/3/17, 2:07 PM - Parker: She chose ucsb
10/3/17, 2:07 PM - Alex Starr: True but she may not have factored in potential transfer
10/3/17, 2:07 PM - Vaughn: Lol i was just saying start there incase the answet was A
10/3/17, 2:08 PM - Vaughn: Baby steps
10/3/17, 2:08 PM - Alex Starr: Right but he wouldn't be asking if it was just A
10/3/17, 2:12 PM - Alex Starr: Also makes u factor in value of relationships with collin vaughn darren family compared to other relationships
10/3/17, 2:12 PM - Matt Casali: Im putting this decision off for a while
10/3/17, 2:13 PM - Matt Casali: Wont ask her until I see her again
10/3/17, 2:13 PM - Matt Casali: If I do
10/3/17, 2:13 PM - Alex Starr: Is she dying?!?!!
10/3/17, 2:13 PM - Alex Starr: Oh ask her at all not see her at all
10/3/17, 2:13 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah haha
10/3/17, 2:13 PM - Parker: If u ask matt u have to be as open minded as one can be
10/3/17, 2:14 PM - Parker: and not take it personally either way
10/3/17, 2:14 PM - Matt Casali: I know that
10/3/17, 2:14 PM - Matt Casali: We've talked about stuff on the same caliber I think
10/3/17, 2:14 PM - Alex Starr: Well u can take it as personally as u want but don't show it
10/3/17, 2:14 PM - Parker: coo
10/3/17, 2:16 PM - Matt Casali: I appreciate the input you guys
10/3/17, 2:17 PM - Matt Casali: Though, apparently you dont read my website
10/3/17, 2:17 PM - Alex Starr: U have a website?
10/3/17, 2:19 PM - Parker: Blog?
10/3/17, 2:19 PM - Parker: do u do that matt?
10/3/17, 2:20 PM - Matt Casali: Wow
10/3/17, 2:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh shit
10/3/17, 2:20 PM - Alex Starr: Haha I'm kidding
10/3/17, 2:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: Just read this
10/3/17, 2:20 PM - Matt Casali: I told you guys a while ago haha
10/3/17, 2:20 PM - Alex Starr: Ik u have a website
10/3/17, 2:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: I have some wisdom
10/3/17, 2:20 PM - Alex Starr: I just don't read it lol
10/3/17, 2:20 PM - Matt Casali: Oh haha
10/3/17, 2:20 PM - Parker: Matt i know about it lol
10/3/17, 2:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: Because I've been in your position
10/3/17, 2:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: You have a couple things to think about before doing anything
10/3/17, 2:22 PM - Jason Greenberg: First of all, above all DO NOT TALK TO FREDI
10/3/17, 2:22 PM - Jason Greenberg: Here's why
10/3/17, 2:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: You don't know 100% that a transfer is plausible. You have to apply first and then make this kind of decision after you get your results. Things look a lot different when you come to Fredi and say 'hey I got into ucsb, let's talk about it' rather than saying that you're thinking aboutbit
10/3/17, 2:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: You have nothing to lose from applying
10/3/17, 2:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: That being said, if you're setting yourself up for a lot of problems in your relationship if you transfer _for_ her
10/3/17, 2:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: *no if * there*
10/3/17, 2:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: What kinds of problems could you see coming out of Ricky transfering to UCLA?
10/3/17, 2:27 PM - Alex Starr: I think that if u don't talk to her at some point, there is no way to justify transferring
10/3/17, 2:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Obviously
10/3/17, 2:28 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz as parker said, she chose UCSB
10/3/17, 2:28 PM - Alex Starr: U just said in all caps don't talk to her so then u think no transfer?
10/3/17, 2:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Wait till you get in tho cuz hypotheticals are needy bs honestly
10/3/17, 2:28 PM - Vaughn: I say transfer to sb without asking and forcefully move in with her
10/3/17, 2:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: No I think wait until you get in before talking about it
10/3/17, 2:29 PM - Alex Starr: Oh I agree with that
10/3/17, 2:29 PM - Alex Starr: U just led with "DO NOT TALK TO FREDI" haha
10/3/17, 2:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: You put a strain on your relationship by creating expectations you can't fulfill, guilt and resentment set in, all kinds of shit
10/3/17, 2:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: That was in case he was texting her rn
10/3/17, 2:30 PM - Alex Starr: Oh ok
10/3/17, 2:30 PM - Parker: I agree with that
10/3/17, 2:31 PM - Parker: Matt i'm gonna say straight up no
10/3/17, 2:32 PM - Alex Starr: Before u say straight up no, ask yourself, what're the odds u go 4 years successfully in a long distance relationship?
10/3/17, 2:33 PM - Parker: If only it was that simple
10/3/17, 2:33 PM - Alex Starr: What?
10/3/17, 2:33 PM - Alex Starr: It is
10/3/17, 2:35 PM - Parker: That doesn't take into account what he has at ucsc rn, and the fact that they're still in college, and also the distance could be much much worse
10/3/17, 2:35 PM - Alex Starr: I wasn't saying only factor that in.  I just think that's being overlooked
10/3/17, 2:50 PM - Ricky: He is only like 4 hours away guys, that's doable distance
10/3/17, 2:50 PM - Ricky: Don't forget that
10/3/17, 2:50 PM - Parker: ^^what i'm tryna say haha
10/3/17, 2:50 PM - Parker: She could be east coast
10/3/17, 2:50 PM - Ricky: If studies at uscs are that important and Freddie doesn't on her own accord wish for you to come to her or not bring it up first, id say stay at ucsb
10/3/17, 2:50 PM - Ricky: So much to lose
10/3/17, 2:50 PM - Alex Starr: That's not doable distance.  Unless he has a 300 mile cock.
10/3/17, 2:51 PM - Ricky: Are u kidding
10/3/17, 2:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: 4 hours is ass
10/3/17, 2:51 PM - Ricky: I do more than that on a weekend
10/3/17, 2:51 PM - Parker: That's nothing u guys
10/3/17, 2:51 PM - Alex Starr: Agreed
10/3/17, 2:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: You could be doing more productive things
10/3/17, 2:51 PM - Parker: then again u think eugene is far🙄
10/3/17, 2:51 PM - Alex Starr: Like ur girlfriend. Regularly.
10/3/17, 2:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah come to mv this weekend Parker
10/3/17, 2:51 PM - Parker: if i had a car i might've
10/3/17, 2:52 PM - Alex Starr: Just quick trip so we can see each other
10/3/17, 2:52 PM - Vaughn: How much is a flight
10/3/17, 2:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: Just for a few hours
10/3/17, 2:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: Gas is pretty cheap I hear
10/3/17, 2:52 PM - Vaughn: Id pay $50 to get you here
10/3/17, 2:52 PM - Parker: It's twice the distance than sb and still doesn't seem far
10/3/17, 2:52 PM - Parker: vaughn like 400 now lol
10/3/17, 2:53 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah we can just grab quick lunch maybe.  I have a lot of work to do but I think I can squeeze u in.
10/3/17, 2:53 PM - Collin Hurst: Train isn't horrible
10/3/17, 2:53 PM - Vaughn: Whats 8 times 50 cough cough
10/3/17, 2:53 PM - Parker: oh shit
10/3/17, 2:53 PM - Alex Starr: More money than I'm gonna pay cough cough
10/3/17, 2:53 PM - Parker: Collin it would take all weekend haha
10/3/17, 2:53 PM - Ricky: I've driven 9 hours of a 24 hour time period
10/3/17, 2:53 PM - Ricky: Cry about it
10/3/17, 2:53 PM - Parker: Moral of the story 4 is nothing
10/3/17, 2:54 PM - Vaughn: We pay for the ticket, parker pays for the food drinks and weed
10/3/17, 2:54 PM - Alex Starr: No it's four hours.  8 round trip.
10/3/17, 2:54 PM - Parker: And....
10/3/17, 2:54 PM - Parker: lol i'm down vaughn
10/3/17, 2:54 PM - Parker: You can come to socal when i visit ricky
10/3/17, 2:58 PM - Alex Starr: Just saying 8 hours out of 48 each weekend for 120 school weeks at minimum wage is 14400 dollars
10/3/17, 2:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: Now do it every other weekend for 3 years
10/3/17, 2:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: Guys it's not 4 hours
10/3/17, 2:58 PM - Alex Starr: Also true
10/3/17, 2:59 PM - Alex Starr: I'd say average 5
10/3/17, 2:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: 5 average
10/3/17, 2:59 PM - Parker: If you drive like a bitch
10/3/17, 2:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: Not even then pman
10/3/17, 2:59 PM - Parker: 4-5 either way haha it's not that bad
10/3/17, 2:59 PM - Parker: he wants to go and visit her
10/3/17, 2:59 PM - Collin Hurst: Here to SB is 5
10/3/17, 3:00 PM - Collin Hurst: From my exp
10/3/17, 3:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: All you can do is listen to books or podcasts for productivity
10/3/17, 3:00 PM - Alex Starr: And that hardly counts
10/3/17, 3:00 PM - Collin Hurst: Just get a tesla and autodrive that shit
10/3/17, 3:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: When do you study?
10/3/17, 3:00 PM - Collin Hurst: Then you can get shit done
10/3/17, 3:01 PM - Alex Starr: Plus it's hard to get lodging that u can use consistently especially while she's in dorm
10/3/17, 3:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: That's not always hard
10/3/17, 3:01 PM - Alex Starr: But it adds up
10/3/17, 3:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: He can live with me anytime
10/3/17, 3:01 PM - Alex Starr: And if it's literally every weekend oh true ok scratch that
10/3/17, 3:01 PM - Ricky: All I'm saying is, people live across the country and make it work
10/3/17, 3:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: They do
10/3/17, 3:01 PM - Alex Starr: Didn't wanna offer for u haha
10/3/17, 3:02 PM - Alex Starr: 1/100
10/3/17, 3:02 PM - Vaughn: Psssshhh you can do other productive things
10/3/17, 3:02 PM - Alex Starr: Do I mean
10/3/17, 3:02 PM - Ricky: They didn't see each other everywekeken this past year...
10/3/17, 3:02 PM - Alex Starr: And I'm sure they just loved it parker
10/3/17, 3:02 PM - Alex Starr: Matt was over the moon without her
10/3/17, 3:02 PM - Parker: Ricky*
10/3/17, 3:03 PM - Parker: if he leaves after class on friday and leaves late sunday that's easy
10/3/17, 3:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Not late sunday
10/3/17, 3:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Early sunday
10/3/17, 3:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Midday Sunday
10/3/17, 3:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Early Friday
10/3/17, 3:03 PM - Parker: Still not bad
10/3/17, 3:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Midday friday
10/3/17, 3:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: 5 fucking hours
10/3/17, 3:03 PM - Parker: Ok either way lol
10/3/17, 3:03 PM - Parker: idgaf
10/3/17, 3:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Have you done it a lot?
10/3/17, 3:03 PM - Alex Starr: 10 hours
10/3/17, 3:04 PM - Parker: i did that last year to visit my dad and it wasn't bad
10/3/17, 3:04 PM - Parker: it was late friday and midday sunday
10/3/17, 3:04 PM - Ricky: I did it to visit you guys last year
10/3/17, 3:04 PM - Ricky: 15 times
10/3/17, 3:04 PM - Alex Starr: People hate 1 hour commutes.  They move to avoid them.  This is a 5 hour commute
10/3/17, 3:04 PM - Vaughn: The horses name is Friday
10/3/17, 3:04 PM - Parker: Alex it's not rush hour lol it's i5
10/3/17, 3:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: We haven't brought up academics and the effect that can have yet but I don't think we need to
10/3/17, 3:05 PM - Ricky: I do an hour and half commute just to play 1 game of baseba
10/3/17, 3:05 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah ricky and u sleep 3 hours a day
10/3/17, 3:05 PM - Alex Starr: Shit ain't healthy
10/3/17, 3:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: True
10/3/17, 3:05 PM - Ricky: I don't....
10/3/17, 3:05 PM - Ricky: Wtf
10/3/17, 3:05 PM - Matt Casali: Im gonna apply
10/3/17, 3:05 PM - Ricky: Apply
10/3/17, 3:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: Show me your sleep rixk
10/3/17, 3:05 PM - Ricky: Do it
10/3/17, 3:05 PM - Ricky: I'm just saying
10/3/17, 3:05 PM - Alex Starr: Ok 5 hours
10/3/17, 3:05 PM - Parker: I'm not saying it's ideal but u make it work
10/3/17, 3:05 PM - Parker: gang
10/3/17, 3:06 PM - Ricky: It wouldn't be horrible to be at a different school as her...
10/3/17, 3:06 PM - Parker: ^
10/3/17, 3:06 PM - Ricky: You guys are making it sound like matt will be miserable if they do t go to the same school
10/3/17, 3:06 PM - Matt Casali: If she tells me that she wants me there Im 80% chance going
10/3/17, 3:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: That's not the dispute
10/3/17, 3:06 PM - Ricky: So you are being bad friends
10/3/17, 3:06 PM - Alex Starr: It would be relative to same school
10/3/17, 3:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: Wtf
10/3/17, 3:06 PM - Alex Starr: He was last year!
10/3/17, 3:06 PM - Matt Casali: But im not gonna bring it up
10/3/17, 3:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: I don't even think he should transfer in the first place
10/3/17, 3:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: I think it's a short-sighted idea
10/3/17, 3:06 PM - Alex Starr: Jason's just saying that long distance would suck balls
10/3/17, 3:06 PM - Matt Casali: I was miserable at first
10/3/17, 3:06 PM - Alex Starr: Elephant balls
10/3/17, 3:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yes
10/3/17, 3:07 PM - Ricky: So ur arguing only to prove me wrong and make matt more unsure...
10/3/17, 3:07 PM - Matt Casali: I made friends and was better
10/3/17, 3:07 PM - Parker: Exactly
10/3/17, 3:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: You lose those if you transfer
10/3/17, 3:07 PM - Parker: ^
10/3/17, 3:07 PM - Alex Starr: Better but not best.
10/3/17, 3:07 PM - Vaughn: What response counts as a she wants you there
10/3/17, 3:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: I didn't wanna bring it up cuz I thought you didn't care about friends matt
10/3/17, 3:07 PM - Alex Starr: Crazy when I'm the optimist lol
10/3/17, 3:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: College friends*
10/3/17, 3:08 PM - Alex Starr: Slight hair brush vaughn
10/3/17, 3:08 PM - Vaughn: "Yeah thatd be pretty nice"
10/3/17, 3:08 PM - Matt Casali: Nah not as much
10/3/17, 3:08 PM - Vaughn: "Hmmm yeah id like that"
10/3/17, 3:08 PM - Parker: "If u want to"
10/3/17, 3:08 PM - Vaughn: "FUCK YEAH GET IN ME!"
10/3/17, 3:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: You do or don't care about your college friends?
10/3/17, 3:08 PM - Matt Casali: I can be friends with people easily enough
10/3/17, 3:09 PM - Alex Starr: Lucky bastard
10/3/17, 3:09 PM - Matt Casali: "Matt, it would be awesome if you went here with me."
10/3/17, 3:09 PM - Parker: Hahahaha
10/3/17, 3:09 PM - Matt Casali: And to clear up I would ask her about thay
10/3/17, 3:09 PM - Parker: starring that message
10/3/17, 3:09 PM - Alex Starr: How about a glance to the side? Seems a yes to me
10/3/17, 3:09 PM - Matt Casali: Acquaintances
10/3/17, 3:09 PM - Parker: i feel ya
10/3/17, 3:10 PM - Parker: forgot to add quotes😉
10/3/17, 3:10 PM - Alex Starr: I don't lol
10/3/17, 3:10 PM - Matt Casali: But especially if I have more of you guys coming to Santa Cruz next year I might not want to go
10/3/17, 3:10 PM - Alex Starr: Lucky....
10/3/17, 3:10 PM - Parker: Lucky
10/3/17, 3:10 PM - Alex Starr: Bastard
10/3/17, 3:11 PM - Alex Starr: Well call u Jon snow from now on
10/3/17, 3:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yes I would fucking love it and we'd hang every day but you should seriously think about it objectively. What precedent does it have on your relationship? What happens when compartmentalization stops?
10/3/17, 3:11 PM - Matt Casali: Just clarifying that the quote was a hypothetical from fredi
10/3/17, 3:12 PM - Matt Casali: Those are good points
10/3/17, 3:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: Do you own your own life?
10/3/17, 3:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: Fuck I'm dizzy
10/3/17, 3:12 PM - Matt Casali: Relationship is really strong right now and can end up stronger
10/3/17, 3:12 PM - Alex Starr: Hell no
10/3/17, 3:12 PM - Matt Casali: If I dont fo I mean
10/3/17, 3:12 PM - Alex Starr: To own own life
10/3/17, 3:12 PM - Alex Starr: Jason lie down for 10 minutes
10/3/17, 3:12 PM - Matt Casali: *go
10/3/17, 3:12 PM - Alex Starr: Happened to me too
10/3/17, 3:13 PM - Alex Starr: Could also fall apart into a tangled long distance mess
10/3/17, 3:13 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ok you know I'm talking about accountability under Illusionism
10/3/17, 3:13 PM - Matt Casali: Then it would eventually
10/3/17, 3:13 PM - Alex Starr: Strongly disagree matt
10/3/17, 3:13 PM - Matt Casali: Because she chose Santa Barbara over Santa Cruz
10/3/17, 3:13 PM - Alex Starr: That's like saying 2x=4 but if we toss 3 in there for x it'll also equal 4
10/3/17, 3:14 PM - Matt Casali: She made the choice to move away and now that she has it will either work long distance or not
10/3/17, 3:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: Apply
10/3/17, 3:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: Don't talk about it
10/3/17, 3:14 PM - Matt Casali: Im doing that
10/3/17, 3:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: Aight
10/3/17, 3:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: Then choose not to go and be happy after that
10/3/17, 3:14 PM - Alex Starr: Don't just move without asking tho
10/3/17, 3:15 PM - Alex Starr: I'm standing by that u should consider it more later
10/3/17, 3:16 PM - Matt Casali: If I get in, I will bring it up
10/3/17, 3:17 PM - Alex Starr: No wait
10/3/17, 3:17 PM - Alex Starr: U should be up already before getting in
10/3/17, 3:21 PM - Ricky: ^?
10/3/17, 3:21 PM - Parker: Hahaha
10/3/17, 3:21 PM - Parker: NICE ALEX
10/3/17, 3:21 PM - Parker: ignore the caps
10/3/17, 3:21 PM - Matt Casali: It doesnt make sense
10/3/17, 3:21 PM - Ricky: Ohhhh sex
10/3/17, 3:21 PM - Ricky: He is making a sex joke
10/3/17, 3:21 PM - Alex Starr: Bingo
10/3/17, 3:21 PM - Parker: Oh that thing
10/3/17, 3:22 PM - Matt Casali: Now I see
10/3/17, 3:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yup
10/3/17, 3:47 PM - Tim Ko: I agree wth jason
11/5/17, 12:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: So Hayley and I went through something similar
11/5/17, 12:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: I wanted to visit her a lot and she was too busy and didn't want me to which hurt
11/5/17, 12:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: In terms of making plans, it gets better with time because you get better at planning in advance because you know what a weekend together looks like
11/5/17, 12:07 PM - Matt Casali: In terms of her not wanting to visit you?
11/5/17, 12:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yes
11/5/17, 12:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: Her not wanting me to come
11/5/17, 12:08 PM - Matt Casali: Like what did you to feel better about that
11/5/17, 12:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: Right
11/5/17, 12:08 PM - Matt Casali: /become okay with that
11/5/17, 12:08 PM - Alex Starr: ^^^^ said ripley to the Android Bishop
11/5/17, 12:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: So right now you said her relationship is supreme in yout life rn
11/5/17, 12:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: I've been there
11/5/17, 12:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: I understand
11/5/17, 12:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: You can only control yourself in this equation
11/5/17, 12:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: And the best thing you can do is to ease off pressure of her
11/5/17, 12:10 PM - Matt Casali: Thats the conclusion I've come to
11/5/17, 12:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: The way to get there
11/5/17, 12:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: Is to not need it as muxh
11/5/17, 12:10 PM - Matt Casali: Hahaha
11/5/17, 12:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: You have to look to other areas of your life for fulfillment
11/5/17, 12:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: When I was struggling
11/5/17, 12:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: I started taking up rock climbing harder
11/5/17, 12:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: I made more plans with friends and thought about the importance school work
11/5/17, 12:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: Find an activity you can really throw yourself into that feels purposeful
11/5/17, 12:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: And do what you're doing
11/5/17, 12:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: Talk about how you feel and figure your patterns of thinking out so you can be more proactive at mitigating your unhappiness
11/5/17, 12:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: Talk to a profession
11/5/17, 12:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: al
11/5/17, 12:13 PM - Jason Greenberg: Is a good option too
11/5/17, 12:13 PM - Matt Casali: Already made an appt
11/5/17, 12:13 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yay!
11/5/17, 12:13 PM - Jason Greenberg: Also wow I totally understand and remember how you feel
11/5/17, 12:13 PM - Jason Greenberg: You can get through this
11/5/17, 12:13 PM - Jason Greenberg: All feelings pass
11/5/17, 12:13 PM - Matt Casali: One thing I've thought about is spending time with friends
11/5/17, 12:14 PM - Matt Casali: I've got Darren at school
11/5/17, 12:14 PM - Matt Casali: And I'm good friends with my roommates
11/5/17, 12:14 PM - Matt Casali: But other then them I dont have a ton of people I can talk to/hang out with at school
11/5/17, 12:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.daylio also use this
11/5/17, 12:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: You don't need too many
11/5/17, 12:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: But make more plans on the weekends
11/5/17, 12:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: Don't spend all Saturday working
11/5/17, 12:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: Balance will get you through
11/5/17, 12:15 PM - Matt Casali: And so I wanna get into more activities - rock climbing, surfing, backpacking
11/5/17, 12:16 PM - Matt Casali: So that I can make friends
11/5/17, 12:16 PM - Matt Casali: But it all costs money
11/5/17, 12:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: Whoah backpacking is dope
11/5/17, 12:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: Join excursion club
11/5/17, 12:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: Or the equivalent
11/5/17, 12:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: Every activity is v social
11/5/17, 12:16 PM - Matt Casali: Idk if we have an equivalent
11/5/17, 12:16 PM - Matt Casali: But again, money
11/5/17, 12:16 PM - Matt Casali: Like I'm good with spending some
11/5/17, 12:17 PM - Matt Casali: But I have to also think about how my spending habits are horrible
11/5/17, 12:17 PM - Matt Casali: Why should I get daylio
11/5/17, 12:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: Uhuh
11/5/17, 12:17 PM - Matt Casali: I had it for a while and it didn't seem to really be that good
11/5/17, 12:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: Do you budget your money for the quarter?
11/5/17, 12:19 PM - Matt Casali: No, it always required more fiscal responsibility than I had
11/5/17, 12:19 PM - Jason Greenberg: Daylio helped me more objectively see what activities made me feel good and become more likely to do them
11/5/17, 12:19 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh I can send you a sample budget looks like for one of my quarters maybe?
11/5/17, 12:20 PM - Matt Casali: That'd be awesome
11/5/17, 12:20 PM - Matt Casali: But I also don't have an incomr
11/5/17, 12:20 PM - Matt Casali: *income
11/5/17, 12:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: Budgeting helps me relax about it during the year
11/5/17, 12:20 PM - Matt Casali: Which is a problem
11/5/17, 12:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: Do you want to get a job?
11/5/17, 12:20 PM - Matt Casali: Kind of
11/5/17, 12:21 PM - Matt Casali: More than being at home doing nothing
11/5/17, 12:21 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t think a daily journal is at all objective but that’s beside the point
11/5/17, 12:22 PM - Collin Hurst: showerthoughts journal?
11/5/17, 12:22 PM - Jason Greenberg: Thanks Alex
11/5/17, 12:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh well jobs are good mang
11/5/17, 12:23 PM - Alex Starr: Np jason
11/5/17, 12:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: They also help you meet people
11/5/17, 12:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
11/5/17, 12:23 PM - Alex Starr: Also gonna throw this out there, we basically had this discussion last year lol
11/5/17, 12:23 PM - Parker: Jason can u send me that budgeting thing?
11/5/17, 12:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: You're very good at every day activism according to my Language and Power class Alex
11/5/17, 12:24 PM - Alex Starr: And it seemed like what Jason advises helped (outside of the journal stuff) so I second it
11/5/17, 12:24 PM - Parker: my spending habits are piss poor
11/5/17, 12:24 PM - Alex Starr: How so jason haha
11/5/17, 12:24 PM - Alex Starr: U guys spend money?
11/5/17, 12:24 PM - Alex Starr: Just don’t buy things
11/5/17, 12:24 PM - Parker: Mostly food
11/5/17, 12:24 PM - Matt Casali: Not an option
11/5/17, 12:24 PM - Parker: cuz i don’t have a meal plan
11/5/17, 12:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: Fact checking on social media is one of the ways to be an every day activist
11/5/17, 12:25 PM - Parker: ^
11/5/17, 12:25 PM - Matt Casali: Showerthoughts journal was an attempt to see change
11/5/17, 12:25 PM - Matt Casali: But its Not structured enough
11/5/17, 12:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: Pman828?
11/5/17, 12:27 PM - Alex Starr: Also send it to me
11/5/17, 12:27 PM - Alex Starr: Tho I’m just curious
11/5/17, 12:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ok haha
11/5/17, 12:28 PM - Parker: yessir
11/5/17, 12:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Sent
11/5/17, 12:29 PM - Alex Starr: I’ve never planned a budget or really much of anything wanna see how ur mind works for planning
11/5/17, 12:29 PM - Alex Starr: astarr1997@gmail.com
11/5/17, 12:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: There's tabs at the bottom for each quarter
11/5/17, 12:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: I sent it
11/5/17, 12:29 PM - Matt Casali: Jason how are things now
11/5/17, 12:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: I'm pretty happy
11/5/17, 12:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: Been doing a lot of friend stuff
11/5/17, 12:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh also
11/5/17, 12:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: Me and Hayley opened our relationship
11/5/17, 12:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: So that's a big development
11/5/17, 12:30 PM - Matt Casali: That was gonna be one of my other questions haha
11/5/17, 12:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
11/5/17, 12:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: That actually just started
11/5/17, 12:30 PM - Matt Casali: Could you explain that a little more?
11/5/17, 12:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: I suggested it a while back when she was saying she missed me a lot because it's something I'm curious about
11/5/17, 12:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: But she said she didn't want that just me
11/5/17, 12:31 PM - Alex Starr: Meaning she only wanted you?
11/5/17, 12:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah
11/5/17, 12:32 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz that’s a confusing sentence lol
11/5/17, 12:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: But last weekend
11/5/17, 12:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: She said she actually might need that and I gave her the green light
11/5/17, 12:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: We made rules
11/5/17, 12:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: And it's kind of scary/exciting/confusing
11/5/17, 12:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: Mostly v new
11/5/17, 12:33 PM - Matt Casali: I've contemplated that with Fredi
11/5/17, 12:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: And?
11/5/17, 12:34 PM - Matt Casali: My main problem with that is that I dont want to enter into any sort of relationship knowing that I have someone else waiting
11/5/17, 12:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: Would you not just keep it physical?
11/5/17, 12:35 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ohh that's not how you operate
11/5/17, 12:35 PM - Alex Starr: Not always a possibility
11/5/17, 12:35 PM - Alex Starr: In sync haha
11/5/17, 12:39 PM - Matt Casali: Basically, I feel like something that intimate is hard to seperate an emotional connection from
11/5/17, 12:40 PM - Matt Casali: How open is your relationship
11/5/17, 12:40 PM - Matt Casali: We can stop at any time
11/5/17, 12:40 PM - Alex Starr: Just saying, it sounds like matt is trying to seduce Jason haha
11/5/17, 12:47 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
11/5/17, 12:47 PM - Jason Greenberg: We can also stop at any time
11/5/17, 12:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: She hooked up with someone this weekend and I feel ok about it
11/5/17, 12:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: I'm more like struggling with like my end
11/5/17, 12:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: I don't know if I can do it
11/5/17, 12:48 PM - Alex Starr: That was a quick turnaround
11/5/17, 12:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: I want to but also feel apprehensive
11/5/17, 12:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: I think I just want to get the first one over with if that makes sense
11/5/17, 12:49 PM - Matt Casali: I felt bad when she hooked up with someone and it wasn't a conscious decision
11/5/17, 12:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: What do you worry about when she tells you about it?
11/5/17, 12:51 PM - Matt Casali: Its hard to tell
11/5/17, 12:51 PM - Matt Casali: I'm so used to being the only one that stuff happens with
11/5/17, 12:51 PM - Matt Casali: Its weird to imagine it happening with someone else
11/5/17, 12:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: I understand
11/5/17, 12:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: It's weird
11/5/17, 12:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: Can you get affirmation from her if you feel insecure or uncomfortable?
11/5/17, 12:57 PM - Matt Casali: Right after she made out with that guy at the beginning of the year I got a lot of affirmation
11/5/17, 12:58 PM - Matt Casali: But regularly, if theres no incident, I don't get a ton
11/5/17, 12:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: Aw man, have you told her that's something you might need?
11/5/17, 12:59 PM - Alex Starr: Need is a strong word
11/5/17, 12:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: Thanks for catching me sometimes I lose control
11/5/17, 12:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
11/5/17, 1:00 PM - Matt Casali: If I told her that, and she changed, it would feel organic and I dont want to make her do anything she wouldn't do because she doesn't want to
11/5/17, 1:01 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah I only do it cuz I think that thinking in terms of needs and absolutes makes it really tricky to accurately evaluate things and reach meaningful conclusions
11/5/17, 1:01 PM - Alex Starr: As soon as something becomes a need, it is unassailable and further discussion is fairly fruitless
11/5/17, 1:01 PM - Alex Starr: Matt relationships are making people do things they don’t want to sometimes
11/5/17, 1:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: I'm sure she appreciates that
11/5/17, 1:02 PM - Alex Starr: No one has a relationship in which everyone always does what they consciously think they want to
11/5/17, 1:02 PM - Jason Greenberg: Have you asked if that's  sustainable for yourself?
11/5/17, 1:02 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah
11/5/17, 1:02 PM - Matt Casali: Its not
11/5/17, 1:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: You're trying to be the best you can be for her but think about it this way
11/5/17, 1:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: What if every time you wanted to hangout with Fredi at home, she never weighed in about what she wanted to do and said "we can do whatever you want today"
11/5/17, 1:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: Every
11/5/17, 1:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: Day
11/5/17, 1:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: That'd get boring fast
11/5/17, 1:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: You're opinions and feelings are part of what make your relationship interesting to Fredi
11/5/17, 1:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: Sharing all of them is a gift
11/5/17, 1:06 PM - Matt Casali: That is completely right
11/5/17, 1:06 PM - Matt Casali: Thing is
11/5/17, 1:06 PM - Matt Casali: I've shared what I wanted before
11/5/17, 1:07 PM - Matt Casali: But it's hard to ask for things if Im not absolutely sure what I want
11/5/17, 1:07 PM - Alex Starr: I mean just try it
11/5/17, 1:07 PM - Matt Casali: I would need to ask for something and give her leeway to maneuver around that and see what works best in the end
11/5/17, 1:07 PM - Alex Starr: Ask even if you’re unsure
11/5/17, 1:07 PM - Alex Starr: Exactly
11/5/17, 1:13 PM - Matt Casali: Where do you find the balance?
11/5/17, 1:13 PM - Matt Casali: Stupid question never mind
11/5/17, 1:13 PM - Alex Starr: Beat me to it by one second
11/5/17, 1:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: I get it's hard
11/5/17, 1:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: The whole world is a narrow bridge and the important thing is not to be afraid
11/5/17, 1:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: You can do this
11/5/17, 1:32 PM - Alex Starr: Wait ignoring the obvious innuendo, what on earth did that second message mean?
11/5/17, 1:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: It's a 9th century Iraeli proverb
11/5/17, 1:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: Definitely open to interpretation
11/5/17, 1:37 PM - Alex Starr: Figured that was the case
11/5/17, 1:38 PM - Tim Ko: If u guys wanna learn how to be tacaño I gotchu
11/5/17, 1:46 PM - Ricky: Thnx Tim
11/5/17, 1:50 PM - Parker: Lol
11/5/17, 1:54 PM - Parker: Damn jason that looks super organized haha
11/5/17, 1:55 PM - Matt Casali: Wait I didn't get anything
11/5/17, 2:14 PM - Parker: it says it sent to u too
11/5/17, 2:32 PM - Matt Casali: Oh just got it
11/5/17, 3:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: Thanks Parker
11/8/17, 10:39 PM - Matt Casali: Jason, you got any more apps on your phone similar to daylio?
11/8/17, 10:39 PM - Alex Starr: What is daylio?
11/8/17, 10:39 PM - Alex Starr: A journal thing?

11/8/17, 10:47 PM - Parker: Questionable logic
11/8/17, 10:50 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah but in all seriousness if he actually did send pics of his log, that would be traumatizing
11/8/17, 10:51 PM - Alex Starr: It’s a dick not a beheading
11/8/17, 10:51 PM - Tim Ko: Also all it said was harmful matter so he coulda just threatened to beat up a kid
11/8/17, 10:51 PM - Tim Ko: Which would be a power move
11/8/17, 10:51 PM - Alex Starr: Maybe if he emasculated himself and sent that it would be traumatizing
11/8/17, 10:51 PM - Parker: Cima move

12/5/17, 10:56 PM - Alex Starr: That’s a step in the right direction
12/5/17, 10:57 PM - Parker: it’s just disappointing
12/5/17, 10:57 PM - Parker: cuz idk if it’s mutual
12/5/17, 10:57 PM - Parker: even if it, i missed a chance
12/5/17, 10:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: Still plenty of chances left
12/5/17, 10:57 PM - Matt Casali: Well I mean you missed it, maybe you can use that experience to do something different next time but there's no use worrying about it
12/5/17, 10:57 PM - Matt Casali: Exactly
12/5/17, 10:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: Just go for it
12/5/17, 10:58 PM - Matt Casali: And yeah I'd def pursue it

12/5/17, 11:10 PM - Ricky: That’s a step up!!!!
12/5/17, 11:10 PM - Tim Ko: I have yet to be in Ricky’s gym
12/5/17, 11:10 PM - Ricky: Damn I like this!!!
12/5/17, 11:10 PM - Parker: i might get a month at the y
12/5/17, 11:10 PM - Matt Casali: Did you study human bio?
12/5/17, 11:10 PM - Parker: No haha
12/5/17, 11:10 PM - Parker: don’t have her number tho
12/5/17, 11:15 PM - Matt Casali: Just talk to her in person
12/5/17, 11:18 PM - Ricky: He does haha
12/5/17, 11:18 PM - Ricky: But talking her online can’t hurt
12/5/17, 11:18 PM - Matt Casali: I'm just saying do that to get to know her more
12/5/17, 11:18 PM - Matt Casali: Nah it can't hurt
12/5/17, 11:19 PM - Parker: i do
12/5/17, 11:19 PM - Matt Casali: But talking in person is nice
12/5/17, 11:19 PM - Parker: but over break
12/5/17, 11:19 PM - Ricky: He does
12/5/17, 11:19 PM - Ricky: Haha
12/5/17, 11:19 PM - Parker: i can talk with her in person
12/5/17, 11:19 PM - Ricky: But if he physically cannot
12/5/17, 11:19 PM - Ricky: Why not
12/5/17, 11:19 PM - Matt Casali: I guess
12/5/17, 11:19 PM - Matt Casali: Just not snapchat
12/5/17, 11:19 PM - Parker: but it’s not enough to where a snapchat would be expected
12/5/17, 11:19 PM - Parker: it would be random
12/5/17, 11:20 PM - Matt Casali: Snapchat is a weird way to have full communication
12/5/17, 11:20 PM - Matt Casali: Better just to text
12/5/17, 11:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: If you're doing snap texts a bunch she's interested
12/5/17, 11:21 PM - Parker: i agree matt
12/5/17, 11:21 PM - Parker: i meant like texting over snap
12/5/17, 11:21 PM - Parker: cuz i don’t have her number
12/5/17, 11:21 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah I just feel like texting is like a tiny bit more personal
12/5/17, 11:21 PM - Matt Casali: If you could get her number that's a step forward
12/5/17, 11:22 PM - Parker: yeah
12/5/17, 11:23 PM - Parker: actually what am i saying
12/5/17, 11:23 PM - Parker: i do have her number
12/5/17, 11:23 PM - Parker: lol
12/5/17, 11:24 PM - Matt Casali: Oh then text her
12/5/17, 11:24 PM - Matt Casali: But like plan to hang out
12/5/17, 11:24 PM - Matt Casali: Texting just for the sake of texting gets old
12/5/17, 11:24 PM - Matt Casali: In my opinion
12/5/17, 11:25 PM - Matt Casali: I'm telling you what to do but this is just what I would do
12/5/17, 11:27 PM - Parker: no i feel that
12/5/17, 11:27 PM - Parker: but i also leave in less than two days
12/5/17, 11:41 PM - Collin Hurst: If it's straight form tinder Snapchat first is better imo
12/5/17, 11:41 PM - Collin Hurst: Texting good from face to face
12/5/17, 11:43 PM - Matt Casali: Why's that
12/5/17, 11:45 PM - Collin Hurst: So you don't get catfished
12/5/17, 11:45 PM - Collin Hurst: Also it's more personable I think
12/5/17, 11:45 PM - Matt Casali: Didn't think of that
12/5/17, 11:45 PM - Matt Casali: Really
12/5/17, 11:46 PM - Matt Casali: Snapchat always seems fake to me
12/5/17, 11:46 PM - Collin Hurst: Plus you can flash the dick
12/5/17, 11:46 PM - Collin Hurst: Y^^
12/5/17, 11:48 PM - Matt Casali: You're posing for a picture. It's based mostly on visuals and not a ton on content of the message
12/5/17, 11:48 PM - Matt Casali: Also, I think people add other people on Snapchat because they want them to see stories
12/5/17, 11:49 PM - Matt Casali: Some people anyway
12/5/17, 11:50 PM - Ricky: That’s my boi
12/5/17, 11:52 PM - Collin Hurst: I feel like it's small talk anyways until u see the person for real
12/5/17, 11:54 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah that's true
12/5/17, 11:54 PM - Matt Casali: The added pictures to the conversation just makes it different
12/5/17, 11:55 PM - Matt Casali: But I also am only comfortable using Snapchat with people I'm close with
12/5/17, 11:58 PM - Collin Hurst: Ah ok
12/6/17, 12:03 AM - Parker: i haven’t texted her separately before
12/6/17, 12:03 AM - Parker: only i. a group with our math squad
12/6/17, 12:27 AM - Tim Ko: I thought we were close 😥
12/6/17, 12:28 AM - Ricky: Lol wut?
12/6/17, 12:28 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah parker! Just do ur best to get to know her and try not to feel so worried when ur not with her
12/6/17, 12:29 AM - Tim Ko: Matt never sends pics of his sexy face to me :(
12/6/17, 12:30 AM - Parker: that’s not what i’m worries about haha
12/6/17, 12:30 AM - Parker: i’m not worried
12/6/17, 12:30 AM - Tim Ko: Ok good!
12/6/17, 12:30 AM - Matt Casali: I always do
12/6/17, 12:30 AM - Parker: that was never the concern
12/6/17, 12:47 AM - Ricky: :( sry tim
12/6/17, 12:47 AM - Ricky: <Media omitted>
12/6/17, 12:48 AM - Ricky: You can have this to Lee your mind at ease
12/6/17, 12:49 AM - Tim Ko: 😂
12/6/17, 12:49 AM - Tim Ko: Oh yes
12/16/17, 5:22 PM - Darren Dawson left
1/8/18, 9:15 PM - Matt Casali: How did your arrangement go with Hayley, jason?
1/8/18, 9:16 PM - Collin Hurst: Since when was I kicked lol
1/8/18, 9:16 PM - Matt Casali: What?
1/8/18, 9:16 PM - Matt Casali: Oh was that your old number?
1/8/18, 9:17 PM - Collin Hurst: Idj
1/8/18, 9:18 PM - Collin Hurst: No I've always had the same number
1/8/18, 9:18 PM - Matt Casali: Oh that's weird
1/8/18, 9:18 PM - Parker: It doesn’t say u were
1/8/18, 9:18 PM - Collin Hurst: Huh
1/8/18, 9:18 PM - Collin Hurst: I see how it is
1/8/18, 9:18 PM - Collin Hurst: No problem.
1/8/18, 9:19 PM - Matt Casali: Well who was 686 7921?
1/8/18, 9:19 PM - Parker: it’s not clash of clans we can’t kick u
1/8/18, 9:22 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah collin
1/8/18, 9:23 PM - Tim Ko: It’s not clan wars, we all can participate in the chat
1/8/18, 9:40 PM - Ricky: Wait what was jasons arrangement
1/8/18, 9:41 PM - Parker: ^
1/8/18, 9:46 PM - Matt Casali: He and Hayley were kinda dating other people for a bit
1/8/18, 9:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: Were open at school
1/8/18, 9:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: I let her do her thing and I do mine
1/8/18, 9:49 PM - Matt Casali: How has that worked?
1/8/18, 9:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: And we talk about it when it comes up
1/8/18, 9:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: Pretty well so far
1/8/18, 9:49 PM - Matt Casali: Like are you happy?
1/8/18, 9:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: I think its a good option
1/8/18, 9:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hang on mom calling
1/8/18, 10:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ideally we'd be together all the time but this makes it easier physically and plus we both get to have some fun
1/8/18, 10:02 PM - Jason Greenberg: How are you doing on this front?
1/8/18, 10:02 PM - Matt Casali: And you're comfortable with being with other people
1/8/18, 10:02 PM - Matt Casali: ?
1/8/18, 10:03 PM - Matt Casali: We're trying something similar but not really similar
1/8/18, 10:03 PM - Matt Casali: We're just trying to have somewhat limited conversation and let the other do their own thing
1/8/18, 10:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: I'm not sure I understand. Do you mean you talk about what happens vaguely?
1/8/18, 10:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: And yeah
1/8/18, 10:05 PM - Matt Casali: Well, neither of us are actively pursuing anything, but if something were to happen we would talk to each other about it
1/8/18, 10:05 PM - Matt Casali: It's just very unknown territory to me
1/8/18, 10:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: I understand
1/8/18, 10:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: Have you laid out very specific expectations?
1/8/18, 10:06 PM - Matt Casali: No, but how would you do that?
1/8/18, 10:09 PM - Matt Casali: Let me just say though
1/8/18, 10:09 PM - Matt Casali: Long distance is fuckin shitty
1/8/18, 10:11 PM - Ricky: I’m sorry Matt :(
1/8/18, 10:11 PM - Ricky: real fucken shitty indeed
1/8/18, 10:11 PM - Matt Casali: I mean it's a known fact
1/8/18, 10:11 PM - Matt Casali: It just is a lot different inside
1/8/18, 10:12 PM - Matt Casali: There's still a part of me that wishes I applied to SB
1/8/18, 10:12 PM - Matt Casali: but another is glad that I didn
1/8/18, 10:15 PM - Ricky: I’m sure, not trying to empathize because I can’t, but I hope you find what you are looking for
1/8/18, 10:16 PM - Matt Casali: I appreciate it Rick
1/8/18, 10:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: Sorry to cut out I was climbing
1/8/18, 10:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: I'm sorry matt
1/8/18, 10:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: I understanf
1/8/18, 10:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: d
1/8/18, 10:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: Is open what you want?
1/8/18, 10:23 PM - Matt Casali: Honestly, I don't know
1/8/18, 10:23 PM - Matt Casali: I know that I feel like time away from her is important in terms of developing my individual self
1/8/18, 10:24 PM - Matt Casali: But I never really felt like I wanted to be seeing someone else
1/8/18, 10:24 PM - Matt Casali: Although, I feel like it
1/8/18, 10:24 PM - Matt Casali: s easier to connect with girls and having an open relationship would give me more freedom with that
1/8/18, 10:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: Here's another question
1/8/18, 10:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: Will it help the sustainability of your relationship?
1/8/18, 10:25 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah, and that's the main reason why I agreed to this
1/8/18, 10:26 PM - Matt Casali: Giving us the time to develop and ourselves individually is gonna be super helpful
1/8/18, 10:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Thats reasonable grounds Id say to push forward into whatever this is
1/8/18, 10:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: [Serious replies only]
1/8/18, 10:29 PM - Matt Casali: What?
1/8/18, 10:29 PM - Collin Hurst: Reddit thing
1/8/18, 10:29 PM - Matt Casali: And yeah, I agree
1/8/18, 10:29 PM - Matt Casali: Oh I see
1/8/18, 10:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: I made an inuendo
1/8/18, 10:30 PM - Parker: congrats
1/8/18, 10:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: Do you feel weird about getting with other girls?
1/8/18, 10:31 PM - Matt Casali: A little bit
1/8/18, 10:32 PM - Matt Casali: But I don't think I would ever feel comfortable with casual sex
1/8/18, 10:32 PM - Matt Casali: And I don't see myself getting into a committed relationship with someone other than Fredi
1/8/18, 10:33 PM - Matt Casali: Maybe too drastic, but it's not something I've thought of
1/8/18, 10:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: Do you want like everything but?
1/8/18, 10:34 PM - Matt Casali: Everything about a committed relationship without sex, you mean?
1/8/18, 10:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: Minus the committed part
1/8/18, 10:37 PM - Matt Casali: I don't know.
1/8/18, 10:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: Are you looking for physicallity, connection, or a combination?
1/8/18, 10:38 PM - Matt Casali: I mean, I still feel committed to her
1/8/18, 10:38 PM - Matt Casali: I don't think I'm really looking for anyone else
1/8/18, 10:38 PM - Matt Casali: At least not right now
1/8/18, 10:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh ok so she is the one who wants openness and youre not too excited about it
1/8/18, 10:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: ?
1/8/18, 10:39 PM - Matt Casali: Nah, I'm not even sure she wants to be with anyone else
1/8/18, 10:39 PM - Matt Casali: Maybe she does
1/8/18, 10:39 PM - Matt Casali: but I'm still unsure
1/8/18, 10:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: Then I am confused
1/8/18, 10:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: You sound confused
1/8/18, 10:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: / conflicted
1/8/18, 10:40 PM - Matt Casali: /\ + /\/\
1/8/18, 10:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ok
1/8/18, 10:41 PM - Matt Casali: As of now, I'm just doing my thing here in sc and she's doing hers in sb
1/8/18, 10:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: As in...
1/8/18, 10:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: Separated?
1/8/18, 10:42 PM - Matt Casali: Separated doesn't seem like the right word
1/8/18, 10:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ok
1/8/18, 10:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: We dont have to talk about this if you dont want to
1/8/18, 10:44 PM - Matt Casali: That's the thing, I feel like I want to talk about and not just keep having it come up in my head and distract me
1/8/18, 10:44 PM - Matt Casali: But then I also don't want to talk and let my mouth take my mind places
1/8/18, 10:44 PM - Matt Casali: Ya know what I mean?
1/8/18, 10:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah I think so
1/8/18, 10:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: Well I'm here for you
1/8/18, 10:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: Also might I note that this medium is not amazing for this kind of thing
1/8/18, 10:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: _italics tho_
1/8/18, 10:46 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah, talking about it in person or even just voice is way better
1/8/18, 10:48 PM - Parker: If only google had a medium for this🤔😬
1/8/18, 10:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: If you wanna chat about it I'm free tomorrow afternoon
1/8/18, 10:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lol
1/16/18, 6:20 PM - Matt Casali: It was difficult today
1/16/18, 6:25 PM - Ricky: what was?
1/16/18, 6:26 PM - Matt Casali: The separation with Fred

1/16/18, 6:47 PM - Matt Casali: Stuff like, if she came to Santa Cruz. Also realizing that I'm probably gonna have a month taken off of my summer
1/16/18, 6:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: Wait why?
1/16/18, 6:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: Also do you feel heavy or slow?
1/16/18, 6:48 PM - Matt Casali: Slow definitely
1/16/18, 6:48 PM - Matt Casali: If I become an RA I would need 3 weeks of training
1/16/18, 6:49 PM - Parker: I’m sorry u feel that way matt
1/16/18, 6:49 PM - Parker: i been feeling down too

1/16/18, 6:56 PM - Tim Ko: Ah ok

1/16/18, 6:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah so I did a similar thing once Matt
1/16/18, 6:57 PM - Matt Casali: I thought it was a joke at first because I've never heard someone use rip seriously here
1/16/18, 6:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: The 1 month no contact
1/16/18, 6:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: And then see what happens
1/16/18, 6:58 PM - Tim Ko: I see matt

1/16/18, 8:39 PM - Parker: 16
1/16/18, 8:39 PM - Parker: so he was old but was really healthy up until 2 months ago
1/16/18, 8:40 PM - Parker: my mom said he had lymphoma which is common in old cats and literally couldn’t eat anymore so was really skinny
1/16/18, 8:40 PM - Parker: so they put him down :(
1/16/18, 8:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: Aww man

1/17/18, 10:41 PM - Vaughn: no tim
1/17/18, 10:42 PM - Tim Ko: #metoo
1/22/18, 12:50 PM - Matt Casali: When you're just trying to do your math homework but your lonely/slightly horny/very confused with your relationship head is creating an existential dilemma as to whether to ask a girl for her number or not
1/22/18, 12:51 PM - Matt Casali: My main conclusion is that the girl isn't as great as I imagine her to be so no use in asking
1/22/18, 12:56 PM - Vaughn: if youre talking about angi you are very correct
1/22/18, 12:56 PM - Vaughn: not what you imagine her to be
1/22/18, 12:56 PM - Matt Casali: Thanks Vaughn
1/22/18, 12:56 PM - Matt Casali: Appreciate the help
1/22/18, 12:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: Whos angi
1/22/18, 12:58 PM - Vaughn: np, are you still feeling down or is that main conclusion the end of it?
1/22/18, 12:58 PM - Matt Casali: The girl we were unnecessarily arguing about on instagram
1/22/18, 12:58 PM - Matt Casali: I feel like I'm still feeling down
1/22/18, 12:58 PM - Matt Casali: Right now, it's just hard for me to be alone
1/22/18, 12:59 PM - Vaughn: how much longer in you and fredis hiatus?
1/22/18, 12:59 PM - Matt Casali: Asking her for her number may be just trying to escape that
1/22/18, 12:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh the one who was so amazing you blew your cover in a minute
1/22/18, 12:59 PM - Matt Casali: Like planning for something to happen with Fredi
1/22/18, 12:59 PM - Matt Casali: Which first of all is no good
1/22/18, 12:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: Do it
1/22/18, 1:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: Unless she's unattractive and uninteresting bc then that feels BAD after
1/22/18, 1:00 PM - Matt Casali: Well she's definitely amazingly attractive
1/22/18, 1:00 PM - Vaughn: you guys still on the break?
1/22/18, 1:00 PM - Matt Casali: But who knows if she's interesting
1/22/18, 1:00 PM - Matt Casali: I think itd feel bad anyway
1/22/18, 1:00 PM - Matt Casali: And she just left
1/22/18, 1:01 PM - Matt Casali: If I see her again I'll ask her
1/22/18, 1:01 PM - Matt Casali: Maybe
1/22/18, 1:01 PM - Matt Casali: Prob not
1/22/18, 1:01 PM - Matt Casali: Well tomorrow night is the end of it Vaughn
1/22/18, 1:02 PM - Vaughn: you cant wait till tomorrow night to see if you shoukd ask for another girls number?
1/22/18, 1:02 PM - Matt Casali: ^
1/22/18, 1:02 PM - Matt Casali: Part of the reason why I didn't ask
1/22/18, 1:02 PM - Jason Greenberg: What happens tomorrow night?
1/22/18, 1:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Full moon?
1/22/18, 1:03 PM - Matt Casali: But theoretically, I may have been missing my only chance ever to ask that girl for her number
1/22/18, 1:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Thats possible
1/22/18, 1:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: If I were you I'd wait for full moon
1/22/18, 1:04 PM - Matt Casali: That's what I'm gonna do
1/22/18, 1:04 PM - Vaughn: in my POV I just cant understand how you could even consider another girl with my perception of you and fredis relationship
1/22/18, 1:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: Whaaaat
1/22/18, 1:05 PM - Matt Casali: I understand that Vaughn
1/22/18, 1:05 PM - Jason Greenberg: That seems far fetched
1/22/18, 1:05 PM - Matt Casali: Like there's no one that I want more than Fredi
1/22/18, 1:05 PM - Matt Casali: But the part of myself that fears being alone is trying to prepare for the worst to happen
1/22/18, 1:07 PM - Vaughn: I see what youre feeling but I just dont understand how you can be feeling it.
1/22/18, 1:07 PM - Vaughn: especially since things will be clearer in a day
1/22/18, 1:08 PM - Tim Ko: Is this othe girl someone from UCSC?
1/22/18, 1:09 PM - Matt Casali: I think it's because im letting my mind play around with what might happen too much
1/22/18, 1:09 PM - Matt Casali: I'm overreacting that's all
1/22/18, 1:09 PM - Matt Casali: Not healthy behavior
1/22/18, 1:09 PM - Matt Casali: I've been trying to stop it but just get carried away
1/22/18, 1:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: Is the break complete tomorrow?
1/22/18, 1:10 PM - Ricky: I think you should think about exactly what makes you happy and what is making you unhappy and display it to whomever it may concern and take action
1/22/18, 1:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: Like the time period?
1/22/18, 1:10 PM - Ricky: No more just sad matt time
1/22/18, 1:10 PM - Ricky: It’s time for action matt time
1/22/18, 1:10 PM - Tim Ko: Google hangout rn?

1/22/18, 1:54 PM - Matt Casali: Too late
1/22/18, 1:54 PM - Matt Casali: Why do you say that though
1/22/18, 2:05 PM - Collin Hurst: Cause "oh well it happened" is better than "what if it happened" ;)
1/22/18, 2:06 PM - Parker: Das true
1/22/18, 2:06 PM - Parker: hangout tonight maybe then?

1/22/18, 5:17 PM - Parker: ^
1/23/18, 10:08 AM - Matt Casali: Collin
1/23/18, 10:08 AM - Matt Casali: Are you and donya still in a relationship?
1/23/18, 10:09 AM - Matt Casali: Like are you looking for something else serious?
1/23/18, 10:12 AM - Collin Hurst: Naht really for both
1/23/18, 10:14 AM - Matt Casali: During summer are you in a relationship with her?
1/23/18, 10:14 AM - Collin Hurst: We're!
1/23/18, 10:14 AM - Collin Hurst: ?
1/23/18, 10:14 AM - Collin Hurst: or will be?
1/23/18, 10:15 AM - Ricky: I think will be
1/23/18, 10:15 AM - Collin Hurst: I don't think so
1/23/18, 10:15 AM - Collin Hurst: Don't really know tho
1/23/18, 10:16 AM - Jason Greenberg: I mean two people can say I love you and fuck but not put a label on it
1/23/18, 10:16 AM - Parker: fwb
1/23/18, 10:16 AM - Matt Casali: That's true Jason
1/23/18, 10:16 AM - Matt Casali: But at the same time
1/23/18, 10:16 AM - Matt Casali: Maybe you want something more serious and more committed
1/23/18, 10:16 AM - Collin Hurst: We haven't really said I love you in a while
1/23/18, 10:16 AM - Jason Greenberg: I'm just quoted collin
1/23/18, 10:17 AM - Collin Hurst: Just ily ironically
1/23/18, 10:17 AM - Jason Greenberg: Ha
1/23/18, 10:17 AM - Jason Greenberg: Whatever floats your canoe
1/23/18, 10:17 AM - Matt Casali: Do you feel like you could get into another serious relationship if you wanted to?
1/23/18, 10:18 AM - Collin Hurst: Well that's true but not very ideal
1/23/18, 10:18 AM - Jason Greenberg: Have you even _seen_ his tinder game?
1/23/18, 10:18 AM - Collin Hurst: Yes
1/23/18, 10:18 AM - Parker: Dillion!
1/23/18, 10:18 AM - Jason Greenberg: Just so we're clear you said this Collin
1/23/18, 10:18 AM - Matt Casali: Do you want to?
1/23/18, 10:19 AM - Collin Hurst: Yeah I did lol
1/23/18, 10:19 AM - Collin Hurst: I mean they CAN
1/23/18, 10:19 AM - Matt Casali: Oh I thought that was to me haha
1/23/18, 10:20 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah, it's a loaded question but I feel like it's important
1/23/18, 10:21 AM - Collin Hurst: Eh not really until I get to wherever I go for transfer
1/23/18, 10:21 AM - Collin Hurst: But who knows
1/23/18, 10:21 AM - Matt Casali: That makes sense
1/23/18, 10:22 AM - Jason Greenberg: Any news on that front sidenot?
1/23/18, 10:22 AM - Jason Greenberg: e
1/23/18, 10:24 AM - Collin Hurst: ?
1/23/18, 10:27 AM - Parker: any acceptances?

1/23/18, 11:18 AM - Collin Hurst: Go to tinder chat
1/23/18, 11:21 AM - Tim Ko: So u swiped right on someone u know in real life?
1/23/18, 11:28 AM - Parker: do you not do that?
1/23/18, 2:03 PM - Collin Hurst: I superliked them
1/23/18, 2:03 PM - Collin Hurst: Wayyy different
1/23/18, 9:25 PM - Matt Casali: Zie break is O-fficial
1/23/18, 9:26 PM - Matt Casali: Break meaning recess in the relationship
1/23/18, 9:26 PM - Matt Casali: Tinder group here I come (potentially)
1/23/18, 9:26 PM - Alex Starr: I’m sorry to hear that matt
1/23/18, 9:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: I'm sorry man
1/23/18, 9:28 PM - Matt Casali: Nah don't be sorry
1/23/18, 9:28 PM - Matt Casali: We didn't break up
1/23/18, 9:28 PM - Matt Casali: Just trying this out
1/23/18, 9:28 PM - Alex Starr: Ur not my supervisor!
1/23/18, 9:28 PM - Matt Casali: If I was?
1/23/18, 9:29 PM - Alex Starr: Then u could tell me not to be sorry
1/23/18, 9:29 PM - Alex Starr: Any other idea what the plan is?
1/23/18, 9:29 PM - Matt Casali: A supervisor holds too much power
1/23/18, 9:29 PM - Alex Starr: U get it’s an archer reference right?
1/23/18, 9:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: So what happened when you talked to her?
1/23/18, 9:31 PM - Matt Casali: Oh now I do haha
1/23/18, 9:31 PM - Alex Starr: The original rick and morty
1/23/18, 9:32 PM - Matt Casali: We talked about our time apart, both what we did and how we felt. Then talked about how we decided we should proceed and we both felt that the two weeks rule is good for this quarter at least
1/23/18, 9:33 PM - Matt Casali: And we'll see what it was like afterwards
1/23/18, 9:33 PM - Matt Casali: But for now we're just friends
1/23/18, 9:33 PM - Alex Starr: So no communication?
1/23/18, 9:33 PM - Alex Starr: Or yes communication?
1/23/18, 9:33 PM - Matt Casali: I agreed cause I really gotta get my shit together
1/23/18, 9:33 PM - Matt Casali: Yes communication
1/23/18, 9:33 PM - Matt Casali: 1 every 2 weeks
1/23/18, 9:33 PM - Matt Casali: It felt good
1/23/18, 9:34 PM - Alex Starr: That’s a positive sign
1/23/18, 9:34 PM - Alex Starr: What shit do u need to aggregate?
1/23/18, 9:34 PM - Matt Casali: Indeed indeed
1/23/18, 9:34 PM - Matt Casali: Shit like the fact that I get anxiety when I'm "alone" for a day
1/23/18, 9:35 PM - Matt Casali: Like get that under control and dealt with
1/23/18, 9:35 PM - Matt Casali: Also need to meet a ton more people
1/23/18, 9:35 PM - Matt Casali: Get that shit dealt with
1/23/18, 9:35 PM - Alex Starr: I’m in a similar boat on one of those fronts haha
1/23/18, 9:35 PM - Alex Starr: 3 guesses which one
1/23/18, 9:36 PM - Matt Casali: Alone?
1/23/18, 9:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: Those are good goals
1/23/18, 9:36 PM - Alex Starr: Need to meet people
1/23/18, 9:36 PM - Matt Casali: This is like Parkers quiz
1/23/18, 9:36 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah I think so
1/23/18, 9:36 PM - Alex Starr: If had anxiety when I was alone I’d have died of a heart attack semester 1
1/23/18, 9:37 PM - Ricky: Matt see a therapist
1/23/18, 9:37 PM - Ricky: And just talk to em about your feelings and thoughts
1/23/18, 9:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: Have you considered, and this is just a thought
1/23/18, 9:37 PM - Alex Starr: Fuck that shit
1/23/18, 9:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: Cutting ties completely?
1/23/18, 9:37 PM - Alex Starr: He said with overwhelming tact
1/23/18, 9:38 PM - Matt Casali: What are you doing to reduce risk?
1/23/18, 9:38 PM - Alex Starr: ?
1/23/18, 9:38 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah I've considered it Jason
1/23/18, 9:38 PM - Matt Casali: But not what I want to do
1/23/18, 9:38 PM - Matt Casali: At least now
1/23/18, 9:39 PM - Matt Casali: I will, however, get the library girls number next time I see her
1/23/18, 9:39 PM - Matt Casali: Left a voicemail today my man
1/23/18, 9:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: 👍
1/23/18, 9:40 PM - Alex Starr: Just saying
1/23/18, 9:40 PM - Alex Starr: Doesn’t a therapist defeat the point of dealing with anxiety about being alone?
1/23/18, 9:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: Do you even therapy?
1/23/18, 9:41 PM - Alex Starr: Isn’t a common tactic forcing people to confront their fears?
1/23/18, 9:41 PM - Alex Starr: By talking to a therapist, matt would be not confronting his fears
1/23/18, 9:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: Dude people need help
1/23/18, 9:41 PM - Alex Starr: I’m not denying that
1/23/18, 9:41 PM - Alex Starr: This particular instance it doesn’t add up
1/23/18, 9:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: Disagree
1/23/18, 9:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: But its not that important rn
1/23/18, 9:42 PM - Matt Casali: I'm going to them for advice
1/23/18, 9:42 PM - Alex Starr: Quick summary of basis?
1/23/18, 9:42 PM - Alex Starr: So not a regular thing?
1/23/18, 9:43 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz advice makes much more sense but regular thing seems like substituting paying someone to talk to you instead of meeting people (not well put by me but you get the picture I hope)
1/23/18, 9:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: Maybe Angi is a licensed psychologist
1/23/18, 9:43 PM - Matt Casali: Maybe!
1/23/18, 9:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: Every heard of group therapy Alex?
1/23/18, 9:43 PM - Alex Starr: Yes
1/23/18, 9:44 PM - Matt Casali: I understand that getting people to talk to can be beneficial in a similar way
1/23/18, 9:44 PM - Matt Casali: But I don't know how to deal with my anxiety while I'm alone
1/23/18, 9:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: Are you familiar with its applicability to feelings of social anxiety
1/23/18, 9:44 PM - Matt Casali: A therapist can offer experienced help for that
1/23/18, 9:44 PM - Alex Starr: Why not
1/23/18, 9:45 PM - Matt Casali: *In a healthy way
1/23/18, 9:45 PM - Alex Starr: My answer is of course is it really something to be dealt with but that’s beside the point
1/23/18, 9:45 PM - Alex Starr: Meant why not for this btw
1/23/18, 9:45 PM - Matt Casali: Oh
1/23/18, 9:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ok well the prosecution rests
1/23/18, 9:46 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t see the connection jason
1/23/18, 9:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: I'm not tryna lecture at you
1/23/18, 9:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: You said you were familiar
1/23/18, 9:46 PM - Alex Starr: Doesn’t mean I see the relevance to this conversation
1/23/18, 9:47 PM - Jason Greenberg: Welp
1/23/18, 9:48 PM - Ricky: Naw
1/23/18, 9:49 PM - Alex Starr: Usually u have to support your argument haha
1/23/18, 9:50 PM - Matt Casali: Nothing wrong with a naw here and there
1/23/18, 9:51 PM - Alex Starr: I dunno
1/23/18, 9:51 PM - Alex Starr: It can be very frustrating when people refuse to justify there arguments
1/23/18, 9:51 PM - Matt Casali: *their
1/23/18, 9:52 PM - Ricky: Sorry was talking to roommates
1/23/18, 9:52 PM - Alex Starr: Sorry
1/23/18, 9:52 PM - Ricky: Matt next time you feel the anxiety write down what ur feeling
1/23/18, 9:52 PM - Alex Starr: Them there arguments*
1/23/18, 9:52 PM - Ricky: Like word for word what ever is hurting you or meaning your heart race or your chest heavy
1/23/18, 9:52 PM - Ricky: Making*
1/23/18, 9:52 PM - Matt Casali: Yee been doing that
1/23/18, 9:53 PM - Matt Casali: It helps
1/23/18, 9:53 PM - Ricky: Nice nice
1/23/18, 9:53 PM - Matt Casali: A tiny bit
1/23/18, 9:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: Make sure your therapist seems confident with your situation
1/23/18, 9:53 PM - Matt Casali: I think it's just one step to the solution though
1/23/18, 9:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: Dont be afraid to ask them point blank if they've dealt with something like this before
1/23/18, 9:54 PM - Alex Starr: Why do u think being alone causes you to be anxious?
1/23/18, 9:54 PM - Ricky: And Alex (And matt) bein able to talk to someone with no potential repercussions helps, like I sometimes and afraid to tell you guys or grace what I’m thinking cuz it just makes me an ass hole so I hide it, and being able to just say shit is nice, also matt, just get comfy and realize, it don’t matter what you say, they are being paid by you or the school to be there and just get comfy and let it out
1/23/18, 9:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: Do you get free counseling at chapman?
1/23/18, 9:55 PM - Ricky: Once you say stuff aloud to people you realize how silly you are being/ lets you figure out free stuff
1/23/18, 9:55 PM - Ricky: Private school gang
1/23/18, 9:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: Fuck you man
1/23/18, 9:55 PM - Ricky: ❤
1/23/18, 9:55 PM - Matt Casali: I get 3 sessions
1/23/18, 9:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lol
1/23/18, 9:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yup
1/23/18, 9:55 PM - Matt Casali: Then I'm on my own
1/23/18, 9:56 PM - Ricky: Idk what my limit is but it seems like I can come back as many times as I schedule
1/23/18, 9:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: Then they refer out to the community
1/23/18, 9:56 PM - Ricky: But usually they say you should go somewhere more specialized
1/23/18, 9:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: Rub it in
1/23/18, 9:56 PM - Ricky: ^^
1/23/18, 9:56 PM - Ricky: Hey man, u get your party city
1/23/18, 9:56 PM - Alex Starr: Personal question

1/23/18, 9:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: School counselor is not amazing here except for like grieving death

1/23/18, 9:57 PM - Matt Casali: Can't hang with themselves gang
1/23/18, 9:58 PM - Matt Casali: Went to therapy for a summer because I didn't know how to deal with being cut off from someone

1/23/18, 9:59 PM - Matt Casali: A year before the summer of death
1/23/18, 9:59 PM - Matt Casali: Rip me that summer

1/23/18, 10:01 PM - Alex Starr: Wait hbu Jason
1/23/18, 10:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh damn I wont press you on that Alex
1/23/18, 10:04 PM - Alex Starr: Shin splints man
1/23/18, 10:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: I built a Harry Potter lego set once
1/23/18, 10:04 PM - Alex Starr: Just intense pain
1/23/18, 10:04 PM - Alex Starr: That would make you wanna go to therapy
1/23/18, 10:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: No it was a similarly relevant fact
1/23/18, 10:05 PM - Alex Starr: In that it would want to make you go to therapy yes
1/23/18, 10:05 PM - Alex Starr: Also my non-answer was totally an answer so not really haha
1/23/18, 10:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lol
1/23/18, 10:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: Anyway before we hijacked this conversation
1/23/18, 10:06 PM - Alex Starr: Whoa whoa hijacked?
1/23/18, 10:06 PM - Alex Starr: I’d say mission fucking accomplished instead
1/23/18, 10:07 PM - Matt Casali: Sleep is necessary now
1/23/18, 10:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: Rest you well, overlander
1/23/18, 10:07 PM - Matt Casali: Just thought I'd update ya guys
1/23/18, 10:07 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah the passive voice isn’t a winner in tinder bios matt
1/23/18, 10:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: Thanks for the up
1/23/18, 10:07 PM - Matt Casali: More than happy to talk about it more if you guys want
1/23/18, 10:08 PM - Alex Starr: Be interested in hearing all about it but only as much as you wanna say
1/23/18, 10:08 PM - Tim Ko: I’m sorry to hear about Fredi matt :(
1/23/18, 10:08 PM - Matt Casali: It was Alex Malo who broke my 17 year old heart, Alex
1/23/18, 10:08 PM - Matt Casali: Nah, no need to be sorry
1/23/18, 10:08 PM - Matt Casali: We'll see how this goes
1/23/18, 10:09 PM - Alex Starr: Ur not my supervisor damn it
1/23/18, 10:09 PM - Tim Ko: What about being alone makes u feel anxious?
1/23/18, 10:09 PM - Tim Ko: If u wanna share
1/23/18, 10:09 PM - Matt Casali: I will
1/23/18, 10:09 PM - Matt Casali: But tomorrow morning

1/23/18, 10:10 PM - Alex Starr: Or just night
1/23/18, 10:10 PM - Matt Casali: Okey
1/23/18, 10:10 PM - Matt Casali: Wow
1/23/18, 10:29 PM - Parker: very mature of you matt imo
1/23/18, 10:29 PM - Parker: i’m glad you have a positive attitude going into it
1/23/18, 10:29 PM - Parker: we’re always here to talk
1/24/18, 9:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: How long do you guys think, honestly, my relationship will survive?
1/24/18, 9:14 PM - Matt Casali: If I'm being honest, I don't know a ton about your relationship with her
1/24/18, 9:15 PM - Parker: i don’t either haha
1/24/18, 9:15 PM - Alex Starr: Give me some data
1/24/18, 9:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: We've been dating for a year
1/24/18, 9:15 PM - Alex Starr: I have much more about other herd relationships
1/24/18, 9:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: Um we see it each other every few weeks
1/24/18, 9:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: Text every day throughout
1/24/18, 9:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: Talk on phone pretty much every day
1/24/18, 9:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: Make plans
1/24/18, 9:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: Fight minorly occasionally but always resolve
1/24/18, 9:17 PM - Jason Greenberg: Enjoy each other?
1/24/18, 9:18 PM - Alex Starr: This isn’t gonna work
1/24/18, 9:18 PM - Jason Greenberg: Our both fairly codependent
1/24/18, 9:18 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah I'm biased
1/24/18, 9:18 PM - Matt Casali: It's also hard to say not knowing the threshold of your guys' tolerance for arguments and things like that
1/24/18, 9:18 PM - Parker: ^
1/24/18, 9:18 PM - Alex Starr: U giving data is biased to the point of not helping haha
1/24/18, 9:18 PM - Parker: those are all expected and/or usual things i’d say
1/24/18, 9:18 PM - Alex Starr: Need to observe to understand or be indirectly given data
1/24/18, 9:18 PM - Parker: that u listed
1/24/18, 9:18 PM - Jason Greenberg: Fights are pretty minor
1/24/18, 9:19 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah I understand
1/24/18, 9:19 PM - Jason Greenberg: Damn
1/24/18, 9:19 PM - Alex Starr: Tbh u don’t talk about Hayley much
1/24/18, 9:19 PM - Alex Starr: Which is a lot of why it’s tough to say
1/24/18, 9:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: And you guys met her once like one awkward night
1/24/18, 9:20 PM - Matt Casali: From what I have seen (very limited, only give it the weight it deserve) it doesn't seem like you talk about her/go after her a ton.
1/24/18, 9:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yikes
1/24/18, 9:22 PM - Alex Starr: There seriously isn’t enough data to make conclusions
1/24/18, 9:22 PM - Alex Starr: Also this is a point in the not therapy column
1/24/18, 9:22 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz an explanation to a therapist is inherently biased
1/24/18, 9:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah but they see through that shit if they have the experience
1/24/18, 9:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: Bc they hear they bias and account for it
1/24/18, 9:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: Even then it doesnt matter cuz
1/24/18, 9:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: They not there to talk about other people or make predictions
1/24/18, 9:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ok maybe that was a tall order asking for an evaluation
1/24/18, 9:25 PM - Matt Casali: ^
1/24/18, 9:25 PM - Matt Casali: Sorry man
1/24/18, 9:25 PM - Matt Casali: Do you wanna talk about why you're thinking about this?
1/24/18, 9:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah haha its because of what we're learning and I wanted to test out these super powers of prediction
1/24/18, 9:27 PM - Alex Starr: Nah I think evaluations are doable for other relationships in the group it’s just tricky cuz u guys are kinda a mystery
1/24/18, 9:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: Well at least I learned that
1/24/18, 9:27 PM - Alex Starr: That ends sooooo badly haha
1/24/18, 9:27 PM - Alex Starr: Like what if I’d predicted “fredi will not go to ucsc”
1/24/18, 9:27 PM - Alex Starr: In what scenario does that end well for me or anyone?
1/24/18, 9:28 PM - Parker: when it’s opposite day
1/24/18, 9:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Depends on how the context
1/24/18, 9:28 PM - Matt Casali: That's true
1/24/18, 9:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Like, how well do you think I'll do on this physics exam classmate of mine?
1/24/18, 9:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: You probably wouldnt be crushed into a blood diamond if they gave an honest answer
1/24/18, 9:32 PM - Alex Starr: But unasked
1/24/18, 9:32 PM - Parker: We don’t talk about non cuffed herd members enough
1/24/18, 9:32 PM - Parker: how are y’all folk doing?
1/24/18, 9:32 PM - Alex Starr: Like I just said “ur gonna get an 83”
1/24/18, 9:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: I might study with more resolve
1/24/18, 9:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: Tape an 83 on my mirror and stare at in the mornings
1/24/18, 9:35 PM - Alex Starr: I’m lost now haha
1/24/18, 9:35 PM - Alex Starr: Bottom line Cassandra always gets shit on
1/24/18, 9:40 PM - Parker: myself included
1/24/18, 9:40 PM - Parker: i’m great thanks for asking!
1/24/18, 9:44 PM - Tim Ko: 69 days
1/24/18, 9:56 PM - Ricky: Atta boy tim, never let a good opportunity pass
1/24/18, 9:57 PM - Tim Ko: Gang
1/24/18, 10:21 PM - Alex Starr: To answer, today was rough
1/24/18, 10:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Classes going ok?
1/24/18, 10:30 PM - Parker: girl wise?
1/24/18, 10:42 PM - Alex Starr: Every day is rough girl wise haha
1/24/18, 10:42 PM - Alex Starr: More or less but I basically worked 11 hours today
1/24/18, 10:43 PM - Alex Starr: Spent the last 90 minutes doing just a terrible job on my multivariable homework
1/24/18, 10:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yikes
1/24/18, 10:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: Not fun
1/24/18, 10:44 PM - Parker: any prospects?
1/24/18, 10:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: Have you figured out your major yet?
1/24/18, 10:44 PM - Parker: aw i’m sorry about that
1/24/18, 10:45 PM - Alex Starr: Wasn’t too bad just didn’t make the progress I wanted to cuz got stumped on my CS project
1/24/18, 10:45 PM - Alex Starr: Ya I’m doubling in applied math and molecular biology but my applied math is focused on CS
1/24/18, 10:45 PM - Alex Starr: Nope (unless failure counts)
1/24/18, 10:46 PM - Parker: recent?
1/24/18, 10:46 PM - Alex Starr: So I have to take a couple lower division CS classes before doing the 3 upper division CS classes for the major
1/24/18, 10:46 PM - Parker: that’s dope!
1/24/18, 10:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh that sounds dangerously dope
1/24/18, 10:46 PM - Alex Starr: More failure by default
1/24/18, 10:47 PM - Jason Greenberg: Now idea how they crossover
1/24/18, 10:47 PM - Tim Ko: Life on mars
1/24/18, 10:47 PM - Tim Ko: Alex will discover that

1/24/18, 10:53 PM - Parker: especially her being in a sorority lol

1/27/18, 4:50 PM - Parker: did you tho

1/27/18, 4:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ha

1/27/18, 4:51 PM - Alex Starr: And that would change...?
1/27/18, 4:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: You wont

1/27/18, 4:51 PM - Matt Casali: That was to you
1/27/18, 4:52 PM - Matt Casali: We just got lunch
1/27/18, 4:52 PM - Matt Casali: Feel like she may have wanted something afterwards but not sure
1/27/18, 4:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: Did you?
1/27/18, 4:53 PM - Parker: Live for today plan for tomorrow party tonight matt
1/27/18, 4:53 PM - Parker: you only live once
1/27/18, 4:53 PM - Matt Casali: Not really
1/27/18, 4:53 PM - Parker: i’m just saying you could do better
1/27/18, 4:53 PM - Matt Casali: Don't feel like I would on a first date like that in less she was absolutely amazing
1/27/18, 4:54 PM - Matt Casali: Not really was to Jason haha
1/27/18, 4:54 PM - Alex Starr: Aka fredi
1/27/18, 4:54 PM - Matt Casali: ^
1/27/18, 4:54 PM - Matt Casali: Honestly, don't think I could do better than that
1/27/18, 4:54 PM - Collin Hurst: Not sick no dick
1/27/18, 4:54 PM - Parker: know yourself know your worth
1/27/18, 4:54 PM - Collin Hurst: Better than what
1/27/18, 4:55 PM - Parker: you ain’t gotta die to get to heaven matt
1/27/18, 4:55 PM - Alex Starr: Legitimately no difference
1/27/18, 4:55 PM - Matt Casali: Parker
1/27/18, 4:55 PM - Matt Casali: If this is drake
1/27/18, 4:55 PM - Alex Starr: It is

1/27/18, 4:57 PM - Alex Starr: Wait I can answer this one too
1/27/18, 4:57 PM - Alex Starr: Not fredi
1/27/18, 4:57 PM - Parker: also wrong chat
1/27/18, 4:57 PM - Matt Casali: Nah it's kinda related to this one
1/27/18, 4:57 PM - Alex Starr: It’s mostly this one
1/27/18, 4:57 PM - Matt Casali: But Alex is right
1/27/18, 4:57 PM - Parker: So u did fuck
1/27/18, 4:57 PM - Matt Casali: No I didn't

1/27/18, 4:57 PM - Alex Starr: Legitimately the four best words in the English language
1/27/18, 4:58 PM - Matt Casali: She wouldn't meet my eyes very often though which was kinda weird
1/27/18, 4:58 PM - Alex Starr: That and “all test cases passed”

1/27/18, 5:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: I understand. I felt the same way about Chanti Holroyd
1/27/18, 5:03 PM - Alex Starr: Well similarly at least
1/27/18, 5:03 PM - Alex Starr: That was a while ago right?
1/27/18, 5:06 PM - Matt Casali: Whaddya mean
1/27/18, 5:08 PM - Tim Ko: Matt maybe u should just be single for a while, don’t try to go on dates, cuz it seems like it reminds u of Fredi
1/27/18, 5:08 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah I think I should be single too
1/27/18, 5:09 PM - Alex Starr: And then it was as if a billion cries of hope were extinguished
1/27/18, 5:09 PM - Matt Casali: The main reason I'm trying to go on dates (not get in a relationship) is cause I don't have too many people to hang out with over here
1/27/18, 5:09 PM - Tim Ko: Oh, what bout ur choir group?
1/27/18, 5:09 PM - Tim Ko: Or ur apartment mates
1/27/18, 5:09 PM - Tim Ko: Or Darren???!!
1/27/18, 5:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: The chanti thing was a half joke
1/27/18, 5:10 PM - Alex Starr: I was so confused
1/27/18, 5:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: ^
1/27/18, 5:11 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah that's true Tim
1/27/18, 5:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: I went on 10 dates before I met Hayley
1/27/18, 5:11 PM - Matt Casali: I guess what I'm missing is just someone to be with a lot
1/27/18, 5:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: So maybe keep trying
1/27/18, 5:12 PM - Matt Casali: Which is why maybe I shouldn't go on more dates
1/27/18, 5:12 PM - Matt Casali: Guys
1/27/18, 5:12 PM - Matt Casali: Im not broken up with Fredi
1/27/18, 5:12 PM - Alex Starr: Did u just assume Parker’s gender?
1/27/18, 5:12 PM - Alex Starr: He’s Canadian damn it
1/27/18, 5:13 PM - Matt Casali: This is mostly just a test
1/27/18, 5:13 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hmm
1/27/18, 5:13 PM - Matt Casali: I'm not looking for someone else
1/27/18, 5:13 PM - Alex Starr: Maybe try other things to meet people
1/27/18, 5:14 PM - Alex Starr: It’s not exactly my area of expertise but maybe like a cooking class or club?
1/27/18, 5:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah join excursion club
1/27/18, 5:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: I'm 2 for 2 this quarter meeting someone that way
1/27/18, 5:14 PM - Alex Starr: In what context
1/27/18, 5:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: Literally every outing there is some cute girl that you dont have to persue
1/27/18, 5:14 PM - Alex Starr: Oh that context
1/27/18, 5:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: 2 hikes, 2 girls I clicked wirh
1/27/18, 5:15 PM - Alex Starr: Did u do something that rhymes with clicked as well?
1/27/18, 5:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: Not trying to steal the spotlight just giving evidence for excursion
1/27/18, 5:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: Well no
1/27/18, 5:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: I didnt like one of them after we went for a date
1/27/18, 5:16 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah, I definitely need to try to join more things
1/27/18, 5:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: And the other is still an option
1/27/18, 5:16 PM - Matt Casali: Part of me knows that I need to find my own things though
1/27/18, 5:21 PM - Tim Ko: Also life isn’t all about finding girls too!
1/27/18, 5:21 PM - Alex Starr: It literally is
1/27/18, 5:22 PM - Matt Casali: Depends on where your priorities lie
1/27/18, 5:22 PM - Alex Starr: Not really haha
1/27/18, 5:24 PM - Collin Hurst: Goal if life is the reproduce
1/27/18, 5:24 PM - Collin Hurst: Is to
1/27/18, 5:24 PM - Alex Starr: Not exactly but more or less
1/27/18, 5:25 PM - Tim Ko: Maybe before but with the population now...
1/27/18, 5:25 PM - Tim Ko: U may be doing more good by not reproducing lol
1/27/18, 5:25 PM - Alex Starr: Evolution gives 0 fucks about the population
1/27/18, 5:26 PM - Tim Ko: Well more population means less resources
1/27/18, 5:26 PM - Jason Greenberg: My genes are triggered by this population talk
1/27/18, 5:26 PM - Tim Ko: Just look at India
1/27/18, 5:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: Not necesaary bc scaricity raises prices which create incentive to find more or create substitutes
1/27/18, 5:27 PM - Alex Starr: Ya they really stopped before it got out of hand
1/27/18, 5:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: The guy who wrote "the population bomb" that was really famous back in the 80s made a bet with an economist about this kind of thing
1/27/18, 5:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: He lost
1/27/18, 5:29 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah evolution still gives no fucks
1/27/18, 5:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: Its true
1/27/18, 5:31 PM - Alex Starr: Minus birth control how we looking
1/27/18, 5:32 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah well ok I was more going for the finding a girl to be with someone rather than to reproduce
1/27/18, 5:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: I mean you can repress your natural inclinations if thats what you mean
1/27/18, 5:34 PM - Alex Starr: Danger will Robinson
1/27/18, 5:35 PM - Alex Starr: Seems tricky to define natural
1/27/18, 5:36 PM - Tim Ko: Don’t we do it all the time
1/27/18, 5:37 PM - Alex Starr: No
1/27/18, 5:37 PM - Alex Starr: We never do
1/27/18, 5:37 PM - Tim Ko: I could say my natural inclination is to have sex with many women but do I do that?
1/27/18, 5:38 PM - Alex Starr: I could say it isn’t ur natural inclination then
1/27/18, 5:38 PM - Tim Ko: Well that’s another argument on what’s natural and what’s not the
1/27/18, 5:38 PM - Tim Ko: Then
1/27/18, 5:39 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah that’s what this is
1/27/18, 5:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: I mean almost every part of your brain lights up when you orgasm
1/27/18, 5:39 PM - Alex Starr: Does even more when u die
1/27/18, 5:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ok sure but you have to experience a whole lot of other things that threaten survival usually
1/27/18, 5:41 PM - Tim Ko: Well I just wanted to tell Jason that we do repress our “natural” inclinations all the time
1/27/18, 5:41 PM - Alex Starr: Not when u die
1/27/18, 5:41 PM - Alex Starr: And again, no we don’t
1/27/18, 5:41 PM - Alex Starr: Who doesn’t love philosophy?
1/27/18, 5:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: I love the greatest showman
1/27/18, 5:42 PM - Alex Starr: Ew
1/27/18, 5:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: Great soundtracj
1/27/18, 5:42 PM - Tim Ko: Alex wouldn’t u like to go bang sam mozer?
1/27/18, 5:42 PM - Tim Ko: Don’t lie to me
1/27/18, 5:43 PM - Tim Ko: But are u gonna do it next time u see her?
1/27/18, 5:43 PM - Alex Starr: If not, it wasn’t my natural inclination
1/27/18, 5:43 PM - Tim Ko: Prob not if she’s not willing
1/27/18, 5:43 PM - Matt Casali: It goes to what natural is
1/27/18, 5:43 PM - Matt Casali: All the thoughts going through his head are "natural"
1/27/18, 5:43 PM - Tim Ko: Alright well idk what constitutes as natural or not
1/27/18, 5:44 PM - Matt Casali: Even the ones restraining actions
1/27/18, 5:44 PM - Alex Starr: U just define it differently tim
1/27/18, 5:44 PM - Tim Ko: But I just wanna say there are stuff we want all the time but we don’t do it for some reason or another
1/27/18, 5:44 PM - Tim Ko: More of adressig Jason’s comment
1/27/18, 5:44 PM - Matt Casali: Nurture!!!1!
1/27/18, 5:45 PM - Alex Starr: Hmmm nature and nurture deciding our actions...
1/27/18, 5:46 PM - Alex Starr: I feel like this is familiar somehow
1/27/18, 5:46 PM - Matt Casali: Alex you would like a book called behave
1/27/18, 5:46 PM - Alex Starr: Oh wait say it with me guys

2/26/18, 9:56 PM - Parker: lol
2/26/18, 9:57 PM - Matt Casali: Wait what happened
2/26/18, 9:57 PM - Matt Casali: I do not remember going for a friend

2/26/18, 9:57 PM - Collin Hurst: Get with the program bud
2/26/18, 9:57 PM - Alex Starr: Matt this is some depleted uranium shit
2/26/18, 9:57 PM - Alex Starr: Some supermassive black hole shit
2/26/18, 9:58 PM - Matt Casali: K

2/26/18, 9:58 PM - Parker: ^
2/26/18, 9:58 PM - Alex Starr: I will spell it out
2/26/18, 9:58 PM - Matt Casali: Oh
2/26/18, 9:58 PM - Parker: Here’s come the airplane matt!
2/26/18, 9:58 PM - Alex Starr: Regardless of how it may offend people
2/26/18, 9:58 PM - Matt Casali: I understand
2/26/18, 9:58 PM - Parker: open wide!
2/26/18, 9:58 PM - Alex Starr: So Collin has been trying to enter this girl
2/26/18, 9:58 PM - Alex Starr: Her name is Tiffany
2/26/18, 9:59 PM - Parker: So dillion is just off the table i assume?
2/26/18, 9:59 PM - Alex Starr: In high school, tiffanie Luther (yes the girl with the makeup channel on YouTube) was friends with Donya
2/26/18, 9:59 PM - Matt Casali: Dillion would probably be down for tiffany too
2/26/18, 9:59 PM - Collin Hurst: Let's put Dillion aside for now
2/26/18, 9:59 PM - Alex Starr: Donya is Collins “””friend”””
2/26/18, 9:59 PM - Collin Hurst: That's a lot of quotes
2/26/18, 9:59 PM - Matt Casali: Alex
2/26/18, 10:00 PM - Matt Casali: Plz stop
2/26/18, 10:00 PM - Alex Starr: I feel like I’m on a roll at this point
2/26/18, 10:00 PM - Matt Casali: Collin how are things progressing with tiffany
2/26/18, 10:00 PM - Alex Starr: In the words of ur soon to be fuck buddy dillion Harper “one is not enough”
2/26/18, 10:00 PM - Alex Starr: Wow going for a friend
2/26/18, 10:00 PM - Matt Casali: You just copied me
2/26/18, 10:00 PM - Alex Starr: Cold
2/26/18, 10:00 PM - Alex Starr: 100%
2/26/18, 10:01 PM - Collin Hurst: Operation Tiffany Verner is going well
2/26/18, 10:01 PM - Alex Starr: What progress has been made?
2/26/18, 10:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: When did she come on the scene?
2/26/18, 10:01 PM - Alex Starr: Have u successfully made ingress?
2/26/18, 10:01 PM - Alex Starr: She hasn’t yet jason
2/26/18, 10:02 PM - Alex Starr: And it’s not Dillion so it’s not a scene
2/26/18, 10:02 PM - Matt Casali: Alex
2/26/18, 10:02 PM - Matt Casali: My man
2/26/18, 10:02 PM - Jason Greenberg: Walk right in
2/26/18, 10:02 PM - Matt Casali: I just wanna hear what Collin has to say
2/26/18, 10:02 PM - Parker: Hahaha yesss alex
2/26/18, 10:02 PM - Parker: i approve
2/26/18, 10:03 PM - Collin Hurst: We planned weekly study seshies
2/26/18, 10:03 PM - Parker: you guys have math together?
2/26/18, 10:03 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah
2/26/18, 10:04 PM - Parker: i study with tristyn but operation is stagnate i’d say
2/26/18, 10:04 PM - Collin Hurst: I have a plan
2/26/18, 10:05 PM - Matt Casali: What's your plan?
2/26/18, 10:10 PM - Vaughn: Its a pretty good plan
2/26/18, 10:10 PM - Vaughn: Step one: cut a hole in the box
2/26/18, 10:11 PM - Collin Hurst: 1. Sit next to
2. Talk and sit next to every class 
3. Study in group outside of class
4. Find a common denominator where we both need work on a section and ask to study individually together 
5. After said study session talk about how you need a good grade in the class and that one session was really productive so we should set up weekly studies 
6? Study outside of school maybe coffee shop 
6? Get food together after study
7. Hangout regularly (best way is ask to celebrate a midterm finish)
2/26/18, 10:11 PM - Alex Starr: Lol
2/26/18, 10:11 PM - Collin Hurst: I'm on 5
2/26/18, 10:11 PM - Alex Starr: Wow that is a whole lot of thought
2/26/18, 10:11 PM - Collin Hurst: There are easy teqniques to skip steps but this is the most smooth
2/26/18, 10:11 PM - Alex Starr: I need to step up my game lol
2/26/18, 10:12 PM - Alex Starr: All I see is spongebob saying “technique technique...”
2/26/18, 10:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: This sounds like weekly free 4th period
2/26/18, 10:12 PM - Parker: that’s elaborate haha i like it
2/26/18, 10:12 PM - Parker: maybe not elaborate but well thought out
2/26/18, 10:17 PM - Collin Hurst: Collins foolproof plan for getting her into your sedan
2/26/18, 10:17 PM - Alex Starr: There’s a take the dirt road home joke somewhere in there
2/26/18, 10:18 PM - Alex Starr: For becoming her man
2/26/18, 10:18 PM - Matt Casali: Yes
2/26/18, 10:18 PM - Collin Hurst: Ah true Alex
2/26/18, 10:18 PM - Vaughn: and her eating your spam
2/26/18, 10:21 PM - Alex Starr: Um
2/26/18, 10:22 PM - Vaughn: Its a big deal in Filipino culture
2/26/18, 10:22 PM - Parker: Don’t be racist alex
2/26/18, 10:23 PM - Matt Casali: Jesus respect other cultures
2/26/18, 10:23 PM - Alex Starr: I’m not denying that
2/26/18, 10:24 PM - Alex Starr: But calling ur dick canned meat seems not quite right
2/26/18, 10:26 PM - Collin Hurst: Tru
2/26/18, 10:37 PM - Alex Starr: Not really His schtick
2/26/18, 11:14 PM - Tim Ko: Nice collin
2/27/18, 11:33 AM - Ricky: Hahahah I greatly enjoyed this series of events
2/27/18, 11:33 AM - Ricky: Matt, your dumb
2/27/18, 11:36 AM - Matt Casali: *you're
2/27/18, 11:37 AM - Ricky: 谢谢
2/27/18, 11:38 AM - Matt Casali: 别客气
3/5/18, 11:28 AM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
3/5/18, 11:30 AM - Jason Greenberg: I read "for the flesh" 😮
3/5/18, 11:32 AM - Alex Starr: If it had said “for the flesh” I’d have read it as to be the flash
3/6/18, 10:53 AM - Jason Greenberg: Darren who is the person in your relationship that makes visits happen?
3/6/18, 10:57 AM - Jason Greenberg added Darren
3/6/18, 10:56 AM - Matt Casali: Darren's not in this chat
3/6/18, 10:56 AM - Jason Greenberg: Fuckin a
3/6/18, 10:56 AM - Jason Greenberg: Darren you're a bitch
3/6/18, 10:56 AM - Darren: Half and half
3/6/18, 10:57 AM - Jason Greenberg: Thats pretty good
3/6/18, 10:57 AM - Jason Greenberg: How often?
3/6/18, 10:57 AM - Darren: Three times this quarter
3/6/18, 10:58 AM - Darren: She feels guilty that it's like a 7 hour commute via public transportation, but that's fine
3/6/18, 10:59 AM - Jason Greenberg: Oh wow thats an improvement
3/6/18, 10:59 AM - Jason Greenberg: What does she use?
3/6/18, 11:00 AM - Darren: Yeah that didn't happen last year
3/6/18, 11:01 AM - Darren: Well when she comes home to see her family she swings by Santa Cruz to pick me up
3/6/18, 11:01 AM - Jason Greenberg: Like by car?
3/6/18, 11:01 AM - Jason Greenberg: What a gal
3/6/18, 11:02 AM - Darren: So she usually gets a rideshare  to the Bay. UCSC rideshare seems to be pretty dead for all things except rides to sf
3/6/18, 11:03 AM - Jason Greenberg: Yikes
3/6/18, 11:03 AM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah I feel like rideshare is infinitely better than public trans
3/6/18, 11:04 AM - Jason Greenberg: Do you think something changed that you guys see each other more often?
3/6/18, 11:07 AM - Darren: She expressed disappointment that I had never gone to slo to visit last year, so that had to be fixed
3/6/18, 11:08 AM - Darren: Even if the reason I didn't go was because she told me not to
3/6/18, 11:15 AM - Jason Greenberg: Hmm
3/6/18, 11:16 AM - Jason Greenberg: Counterintuitive
3/6/18, 11:19 AM - Matt Casali: :/
3/6/18, 11:19 AM - Darren: Yeah that angst was dumb
3/6/18, 11:21 AM - Jason Greenberg: I understand, I think the worst thing is like the other person not wanting to feel guilty for you traveling a long way which compounds your reluctance to go in the first place
3/6/18, 11:30 AM - Darren: Yeah it's a bummer
3/6/18, 11:32 AM - Jason Greenberg: I'm in a pickle with same elements moved around. I'm annoyed at Hayley because I've moved heaven earth to visit her this year but she doesn't reciprocate and won't consider public transportation
3/6/18, 11:33 AM - Matt Casali: I mean, speaking from experience, the other person probably wants time to figure out their college experience on their own
3/6/18, 11:33 AM - Matt Casali: In some cases
3/6/18, 11:33 AM - Matt Casali: In some cases
3/6/18, 11:33 AM - Jason Greenberg: In some cases*
3/6/18, 11:34 AM - Darren: That happened to me too. When that stance changed it was weird
3/6/18, 11:34 AM - Jason Greenberg: I think its different now that we're sophomores
3/6/18, 11:36 AM - Matt Casali: Maybe a little bit
3/6/18, 11:36 AM - Matt Casali: But you did start dating last year
3/6/18, 11:36 AM - Jason Greenberg: Last year that applied but its not a factor rn
3/6/18, 11:37 AM - Darren: Christine actually wouldn't let me visit in the first quarter because she wanted to figure college out. I understood and respected that. Then all of a sudden in winter and spring quarter she wanted me to come and visit so I could meet her friends. Then when I try to come meet them she tells me I can't because it's one of their birthdays, so I say fuck it I'm not coming this year. And here we are
3/6/18, 11:37 AM - Matt Casali: In the time that you may have instead been spending figuring things out on an individual level
3/6/18, 11:37 AM - Darren: Isn't that more of just being naive to college experience than being in a new relationship?
3/6/18, 11:37 AM - Matt Casali: Hmm maybe
3/6/18, 11:37 AM - Jason Greenberg: Yes it is
3/6/18, 11:38 AM - Matt Casali: When you're in a new relationship, a lot of your attention may be taken up in putting effort into that relationship
3/6/18, 11:38 AM - Matt Casali: Attention that could be directed to setting foundations at a new school
3/6/18, 11:38 AM - Matt Casali: Not saying that it's impossible to do so, it's far from it
3/6/18, 11:38 AM - Darren: They aren't at new schools
3/6/18, 11:39 AM - Matt Casali: Last year I mean
3/6/18, 11:39 AM - Jason Greenberg: Wait matt who are you talking to
3/6/18, 11:39 AM - Matt Casali: You jason
3/6/18, 11:39 AM - Jason Greenberg: Oh
3/6/18, 11:39 AM - Jason Greenberg: I mean yeah that was a thing in the balance last year some but we also like were very 50/50 about visiting
3/6/18, 11:40 AM - Matt Casali: So maybe that was too much for her
3/6/18, 11:40 AM - Jason Greenberg: We each split zipcars and got rides
3/6/18, 11:40 AM - Matt Casali: My info is super limited tho
3/6/18, 11:40 AM - Jason Greenberg: Right like I'm just dissappointed in her because I expected more, you know?
3/6/18, 11:41 AM - Darren: There's no winning in that situation. I'm sorry jason
3/6/18, 11:41 AM - Jason Greenberg: Public transport is fucking hard but like her reasoning that I'm able to and she isnt was "that I have more patience"
3/6/18, 11:42 AM - Jason Greenberg: Fuck me but that's like pretty poor behavior
3/6/18, 11:42 AM - Jason Greenberg: I'm mostly venting
3/6/18, 11:44 AM - Darren: Connotation being her time is more valuable
3/6/18, 11:45 AM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah thats the subtext
3/6/18, 11:46 AM - Jason Greenberg: Or that it isn't worth the time put in
3/6/18, 11:46 AM - Parker: that’s annoying
3/6/18, 11:47 AM - Jason Greenberg: It's made worse by the fact that she said she would come see me over her break
3/6/18, 11:47 AM - Darren: Explain
3/6/18, 11:47 AM - Ricky: Is that a past break that she didn’t follow up on?
3/6/18, 11:48 AM - Ricky: ^^
3/6/18, 11:48 AM - Jason Greenberg: She's on spring break starting this weekend
3/6/18, 11:49 AM - Jason Greenberg: She said that she would find a way to see me this next week, we're hitting like the 4+ week apart mark around then
3/6/18, 11:49 AM - Jason Greenberg: So she'll be up in the bay
3/6/18, 11:51 AM - Jason Greenberg: And the plan was for her to come down to visit me bc she hasnt come since last year
3/6/18, 11:51 AM - Jason Greenberg: She was fine asking me to drive up to her this weekend tho
3/6/18, 11:52 AM - Jason Greenberg: Should I tell her that I'm disappointed in her?
3/6/18, 11:53 AM - Darren: Um
3/6/18, 11:53 AM - Darren: What's the probability that will help
3/6/18, 11:53 AM - Jason Greenberg: I dont know
3/6/18, 11:54 AM - Jason Greenberg: I feel like I'm getting the short end of the stick here
3/6/18, 11:54 AM - Jason Greenberg: What would Batman do?
3/6/18, 11:54 AM - Ricky: jason, i feel like from her end, and this doens't justify her actions, is that she feels since you have a car, you should be more obligated to drive
3/6/18, 11:54 AM - Parker: you definitely are
3/6/18, 11:54 AM - Parker: but i wouldn’t say that
3/6/18, 11:55 AM - Parker: cuz it wouldn’t help
3/6/18, 11:55 AM - Jason Greenberg: Yes I understand that
3/6/18, 11:55 AM - Parker: but if she’s at home this weekend she will have a car won’t she?
3/6/18, 11:55 AM - Jason Greenberg: Not necessarily she has sibs
3/6/18, 11:55 AM - Jason Greenberg: I offered to add her to the ucsb rideshare page and she was also against that which was weird
3/6/18, 11:56 AM - Ricky: can she not swing by you on the way up?
3/6/18, 11:57 AM - Ricky: or is she flying?
3/6/18, 11:57 AM - Darren: Batman would probably just use the batwing
3/6/18, 11:57 AM - Ricky: I jsut see little outcomes from her actions that will result in a fully happy and fully fulfilling visit from her
3/6/18, 11:58 AM - Ricky: she just makes it sound like a chore
3/6/18, 11:58 AM - Ricky: rather than an opportunity
3/6/18, 11:58 AM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah she's flying
3/6/18, 11:58 AM - Ricky: I'm sorry bud :(
3/6/18, 11:58 AM - Jason Greenberg: Yes
3/6/18, 11:58 AM - Ricky: damn
3/6/18, 11:58 AM - Jason Greenberg: Ugh
3/6/18, 11:58 AM - Ricky: 你现在做什么？
3/6/18, 11:58 AM - Jason Greenberg: So I should not tell her I'm disappointed?
3/6/18, 11:59 AM - Ricky: 我可以给你打电话吗？
3/6/18, 11:59 AM - Jason Greenberg: 对
3/6/18, 11:59 AM - Parker: Woah there
3/6/18, 12:01 PM - Darren: If she visits under duress is that acceptable
3/6/18, 12:05 PM - Collin Hurst: I read that as underdressed
3/6/18, 12:08 PM - Darren: You horny little boy
3/6/18, 12:08 PM - Collin Hurst: Teehee
3/6/18, 12:20 PM - Matt Casali: Oh no
3/6/18, 12:31 PM - Ricky: jason is a fine young man
3/6/18, 12:31 PM - Ricky: he will sort himself out
3/6/18, 12:31 PM - Ricky: nothing can get in the way of him
3/6/18, 12:31 PM - Darren: Questionable
3/6/18, 12:35 PM - Collin Hurst: C'est n'importe quoi!
3/6/18, 12:35 PM - Collin Hurst: Jason est magnifique
3/6/18, 1:29 PM - Alex Starr: What’d u decide to do jason?
3/6/18, 1:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: I'll let you know
3/6/18, 4:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: I took Ricks advice and made a grand gesture of goodwill
3/6/18, 4:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: It worked bc she tried harder to get a car to come see me and now she is next week!
3/6/18, 4:08 PM - Alex Starr: What was the gesture?
3/6/18, 4:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: Thanks Rick 😘
3/6/18, 4:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: I offered to come see her bc she more important than excursion club
3/6/18, 4:08 PM - Ricky: 👍 glad to help
3/6/18, 4:11 PM - Darren: That turned out well
3/6/18, 4:11 PM - Ricky: Time apart can mess with the mind
3/6/18, 4:11 PM - Darren: Melodramatic
3/6/18, 4:12 PM - Ricky: Indepentand verification, the 4fth part of the 6th principles of internal control helped you out here, and it helped prevent relationship fraud
3/6/18, 4:12 PM - Ricky: 6*
3/6/18, 4:12 PM - Tim Ko: Ganggg
3/6/18, 4:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: I think we all learned something today
3/6/18, 4:14 PM - Matt Casali: Wait what
3/6/18, 4:16 PM - Parker: that’s alex’s line
3/6/18, 4:21 PM - Alex Starr: That is my line
3/6/18, 4:21 PM - Alex Starr: Disagree lol
3/6/18, 4:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: That is also your line
3/6/18, 4:22 PM - Alex Starr: Right?
3/6/18, 4:22 PM - Alex Starr: What did we learn?
3/6/18, 4:22 PM - Alex Starr: Just curious
3/6/18, 4:24 PM - Alex Starr: If we can’t state what we learned did we learn it?
3/6/18, 4:33 PM - Parker: to always take ricky’s relationship advice no matter who says what
3/6/18, 4:35 PM - Alex Starr: Lol
3/6/18, 4:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: There's the bow
3/6/18, 5:20 PM - Tim Ko: Gang
4/1/18, 4:16 PM - Matt Casali: Fredi left today. Difficult time, but I'm more confident this quarter
4/1/18, 4:17 PM - Matt Casali: I'm in for a rough couple weeks potentially but I'm better equipped to handle it this time
4/1/18, 4:17 PM - Matt Casali: Jason asked to be caught up so I can give you guys a brief summary of where things are with her:
4/1/18, 4:22 PM - Matt Casali: We started the break attempting to keep our relationship limited to a friendship but we gave in, so we spent this break how we usually are together and spent a lot of good time together. She left today confused but happy about how she spent the time. And I'm not as confused (cause I'm confident about how I feel about her and that I want to be with her) as she is, but I'm definitely really happy about the time I spent with her.
4/1/18, 4:24 PM - Matt Casali: I also would really like to know if/when you guys would like to go to SB as well as if/when jason would be willing to host us
4/1/18, 4:27 PM - Alex Starr: Always look on the bright side of life
4/1/18, 4:44 PM - Tim Ko: Thx for sharing!
4/1/18, 5:07 PM - Parker: Good to hear matt! You can do it, you’ve done it to this point even if it hasn’t always been easy
4/1/18, 5:07 PM - Parker: 💪🏼💪🏼
4/1/18, 5:11 PM - Matt Casali: Thanks friends
4/1/18, 5:22 PM - Ricky: I believe in you Marty ❤❤
4/1/18, 5:22 PM - Ricky: Matty*****
4/1/18, 8:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: Matty Im excited for you
4/1/18, 8:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ive never been in your position but it sounds hopeful
4/3/18, 9:40 AM - Matt Casali: The mothers who regret having children - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43555736
4/3/18, 11:28 PM - Parker: How to read a girl: i need a lesson
4/3/18, 11:28 PM - Parker: jason matt
4/3/18, 11:28 PM - Parker: ricky
4/3/18, 11:28 PM - Matt Casali: I'm honored
4/3/18, 11:28 PM - Matt Casali: She'll usually speak to you
4/3/18, 11:28 PM - Matt Casali: Then you listen
4/3/18, 11:33 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
4/3/18, 11:34 PM - Tim Ko: I usually overthink things in the past so I’ve decided to give up
4/3/18, 11:35 PM - Tim Ko: If a girl wants me she’s gotta be damn obvious
4/3/18, 11:38 PM - Parker: it’s rarely one on one which is tough
4/3/18, 11:38 PM - Parker: but it’s good when it is
4/3/18, 11:38 PM - Parker: check
4/3/18, 11:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: Try thinking about it the other way. If you show that you're obviously interested, you become more attractive in most cases
4/3/18, 11:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: What's more attractive than someone who likes you?
4/3/18, 11:41 PM - Darren: Someone who is attractive
4/3/18, 11:41 PM - Darren: /s
4/3/18, 11:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: Also money
4/3/18, 11:41 PM - Darren: Parker the solution is to buy women
4/3/18, 11:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: But still being blatant can be a good thing
4/3/18, 11:42 PM - Parker: in what sense
4/3/18, 11:43 PM - Parker: True which is why it’s complicating
4/3/18, 11:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: If you really like someone you should ask them on a date
4/3/18, 11:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: Or tell them you like them
4/3/18, 11:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: What is complicate
4/3/18, 11:48 PM - Parker: Like i like her but idk if she knows it or not
4/3/18, 11:49 PM - Parker: /has any interest back
4/3/18, 11:49 PM - Parker: i feel like that doesn’t go well
4/3/18, 11:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: Have you ever told a person you liked them in a platonic way?
4/3/18, 11:51 PM - Parker: Shayda 6th grade
4/3/18, 11:51 PM - Parker: Lol jk no i haven’t
4/3/18, 11:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lol
4/3/18, 11:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: What about someone to you
4/3/18, 11:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: You know what nevermind but showing your interest is a part of attraction
4/4/18, 12:32 AM - Tim Ko: You know what, u should poke her on fb
4/4/18, 12:33 AM - Tim Ko: That will make it more obvious
4/4/18, 12:33 AM - Collin Hurst: This
4/4/18, 2:20 AM - Parker: I did hahaha
4/4/18, 8:33 AM - Parker: also this
4/4/18, 9:07 AM - Alex Starr: Agreed
4/4/18, 10:04 AM - Matt Casali: Eye contact is huge btw
4/4/18, 10:28 AM - Parker: agreed
4/4/18, 10:29 AM - Parker: it’s just hard to tell
4/4/18, 11:08 AM - Alex Starr: So just go for it
4/4/18, 11:08 AM - Alex Starr: Worst case, mild rejection
4/4/18, 11:27 AM - Jason Greenberg: V true
4/4/18, 11:31 AM - Darren: But what about the lost possibility of a budding friendship due to unbearable awkwardness or something
4/4/18, 11:53 AM - Alex Starr: People forget shit
4/4/18, 11:53 AM - Alex Starr: Fast
4/4/18, 11:55 AM - Parker: That’s part of the conflict
4/4/18, 11:55 AM - Parker: but not a huge part of it
4/4/18, 11:56 AM - Alex Starr: Then what’s the conflict?
4/4/18, 12:24 PM - Parker: Self doubt mostly
4/4/18, 12:25 PM - Parker: mixed signals
4/4/18, 12:25 PM - Parker: all her friends are frat dudes who are good looking so it’s like why me
4/4/18, 12:25 PM - Parker: which sounds sad af lol but
4/4/18, 12:26 PM - Alex Starr: Why not give it a shot?
4/4/18, 12:27 PM - Alex Starr: When there is no downside really
4/4/18, 12:29 PM - Alex Starr: Only reason I can think of is that their is no upside but if ur this conflicted there could clearly be upside
4/4/18, 12:42 PM - Tim Ko: Is this about trysten?
4/4/18, 12:43 PM - Alex Starr: Come on u can spell it haha
4/4/18, 12:43 PM - Vaughn: Trident
4/4/18, 12:44 PM - Matt Casali: Pass her note saying "do you like me?" With check boxes for yes, no and maybe
4/4/18, 12:45 PM - Alex Starr: Bingo
4/4/18, 12:58 PM - Parker: there’s definitely upside
4/4/18, 1:00 PM - Parker: slight downside
4/4/18, 1:16 PM - Alex Starr: Just do it
4/4/18, 1:33 PM - Tim Ko: ^
4/9/18, 11:42 PM - Matt Casali: I had like a very weird day emotionally, and I just ended it by watching the office episode where Jim asks Pam on their first date and I'll never understand how that show speaks to me so well
4/9/18, 11:42 PM - Matt Casali: Also I feel like im slightly dying but I dont know if I am
4/9/18, 11:43 PM - Matt Casali: I just feel like I'm so close to having a good life but I dont know what I need to change or do
4/9/18, 11:43 PM - Matt Casali: Oh well
4/9/18, 11:43 PM - Matt Casali: Its kinda why I've been prodding the chat along to day
4/9/18, 11:44 PM - Matt Casali: *today
4/9/18, 11:44 PM - Matt Casali: Just felt like I wanted to discuss stuff and distract myself
4/9/18, 11:44 PM - Matt Casali: So sorry about that
4/9/18, 11:44 PM - Matt Casali: Kind of
4/9/18, 11:44 PM - Ricky: :(
4/9/18, 11:44 PM - Ricky: I’m sorry matty
4/9/18, 11:44 PM - Ricky: Don’t be sorry for that!
4/9/18, 11:44 PM - Ricky: We appreciate your company no matter what form it takes
4/9/18, 11:45 PM - Ricky: I hope you are sorting your things out and I hope you know you are far from dying, you got soooooo so so much ahead of you
4/9/18, 11:52 PM - Matt Casali: Ye yeet
4/9/18, 11:52 PM - Matt Casali: Thanks rick
4/9/18, 11:52 PM - Tim Ko: Hit us up whenever u want man, we here for u
4/9/18, 11:55 PM - Parker: ❤❤
4/9/18, 11:56 PM - Matt Casali: Thanks Tim
4/9/18, 11:56 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah the office is too good man
4/9/18, 11:56 PM - Collin Hurst: You have shoulder anytime matt
4/13/18, 11:24 PM - Matt Casali: I think I've been the only one posting in this chat
4/13/18, 11:25 PM - Matt Casali: But I wanted to say that Fredi and I are continuing our break for this quarter
4/13/18, 11:25 PM - Matt Casali: And in not going to see her a ton over the summer
4/13/18, 11:25 PM - Matt Casali: And as much as I try not to think about it, it still keeps on bothering me
4/13/18, 11:26 PM - Matt Casali: I just really have no idea of what to do about this whole situation
4/13/18, 11:42 PM - Vaughn: Sorry to hear that man, i was hoping that things were looking bright with the letter she sent, but I guess it meant different things
4/13/18, 11:46 PM - Collin Hurst: I think it's important not to put your life on hold also, make sure you're still having fun
4/13/18, 11:48 PM - Parker: ^
4/14/18, 8:10 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah it was still nice though
4/14/18, 8:10 AM - Matt Casali: And yes I feel that. Although it's hard not to feel like there's still a slight chance that things might work out
4/14/18, 8:11 AM - Matt Casali: So for that reason and others I'm probably not gonna date this quarter like I did last quarter
4/14/18, 8:47 AM - Jason Greenberg: We should google hangout this week
4/14/18, 8:52 AM - Jason Greenberg: Poor buddy
4/14/18, 8:55 AM - Parker: ^
4/14/18, 10:41 AM - Matt Casali: I'm down
4/14/18, 10:42 AM - Alex Starr: What time
4/14/18, 11:26 AM - Darren: So I'm in a mildly parallel situation, maybe listening to my troubles could help
4/14/18, 11:27 AM - Darren: As you know, Christine and I have been dating for a while now
4/14/18, 11:28 AM - Darren: Which means we haven't gotten in any large fights or anything like that. We have highs and lows, but we still love each other and having been, to put it into song, going the distance
4/14/18, 11:31 AM - Darren: That said, since college started, the lows have definitely been more prevalent than the highs. As previously mentioned (a year ago), she isn't great at communicating while away and I'm not great at motivating her to do so. While she is away at SLO, she often feels like she isn't even in a relationship. Adding more frequent visits doesn't help, since its akin to pouring a cup of water on a fire.
4/14/18, 11:34 AM - Darren: She gets really sad and moody while she's away because she likes feeling like she's in a relationship. I try to support her as much as possible, but it doesn't really help. Ultimately, that sense of physical locality is a huge part of what makes a relationship feel real to her, and thats not really a problem I feasibly can solve. So, that means she's incredibly sad about our relationship almost the entire time shes at school
4/14/18, 11:36 AM - Darren: When we see each other over longer breaks, she's able to recharge. Things are great when we are home. I love seeing her; I love being with her family. Things work out and we remember why we've gotten as far as we have
4/14/18, 11:39 AM - Darren: But this summer she isn't coming home because she's working in SLO. Even if I were to visit frequently, I don't think I'd be staying for enough time over the course of the summer for our feelings to catch up entirely. She is really scared about it because she knows how shitty we are when we don't have a school break to see one another.
4/14/18, 11:41 AM - Darren: Overall, I'm fine with not having her go to my school. Distance is just a fact of life, and I try to give her the tools she needs to succeed away from me. I try to talk to her when possible, I give her space when she seems like she needs it. I'm fine with not having my S/O here
4/14/18, 11:42 AM - Darren: I don't really do much: I go to classes, study, and work on various things. I don't feel the need to be that social.
4/14/18, 11:45 AM - Darren: But Christine does need to be social, and that includes her need for someone to be nearby. She's already a more emotional person, but then other factors compound to make it even harder. Ultimately, I know that she is miserable at school because of us - we've talked about it. I hate seeing her like that. I know that while it isn't explicitly my fault that she feels so bad, the fact that we are still together is the root of a lot of her pain.
4/14/18, 11:48 AM - Darren: I've told her many times that if I'm causing her pain, she should break up with me. I earnestly believe that she'd be happier in the average case without me. She wouldn't feel like she's holding on to a dying relationship, she could be social however she wants, she could build up towards something new at school without some bloke at Santa Cruz in the picture. No matter how great our times are when we are at home, she'd be happier on average if she wasn't tied to me.
4/14/18, 11:49 AM - Darren: In an Amdahl's law problem, you want to optimize the area that has the largest percentage of time involved. And that, clearly, is when she's at school.
4/14/18, 11:50 AM - Darren: But she won't break up with me because she loves me and doesn't want to hurt me. Plus, there's the longterm hope that things get better, which has kind of trapped us into this super emotionally polarizing relationship.
4/14/18, 11:55 AM - Darren: I think the responsible thing to do would be to break up with her. Whether I like it or not, this feeling of being tied - obligated - to someone  who causes you so much pain is toxic. Even if the motivation for staying together is amazing, the reality is that it is causing more harm than good.  Christine and I have talked about this many, many times, but she can't find it in herself to break up with me. She doesn't know if it'll make her happier. I may have to do the adult thing and cut it off, even if it breaks both our hearts
4/14/18, 11:55 AM - Darren: And, that, Sex & Relationships, is how Apache Arrow optimizes memory latency for big data transactions
4/14/18, 12:08 PM - Matt Casali: Hahaha
4/14/18, 12:09 PM - Matt Casali: But Darren, everything you said is something that I have experienced or am experiencing
4/14/18, 12:09 PM - Alex Starr: A strange time to laugh
4/14/18, 12:09 PM - Matt Casali: All except for this
4/14/18, 12:10 PM - Matt Casali: I think this may be my case as well, but my hopes for the future have been so overwhelmingly prevalent that it ties me to the relationship really strongly
4/14/18, 12:11 PM - Alex Starr: This is rather direct, but what would break that hope?
4/14/18, 12:14 PM - Matt Casali: If she were to cut off contact from me completely like Alex Malo did initially
4/14/18, 12:14 PM - Matt Casali: That's a strong case but I'm also always determining the future of my relationships and the benefits they have to me
4/14/18, 12:14 PM - Alex Starr: Ah I my question was wrong sorry
4/14/18, 12:14 PM - Matt Casali: Most of the time its optimistic analysis
4/14/18, 12:15 PM - Matt Casali: Oh haha
4/14/18, 12:15 PM - Matt Casali: But Darren I'm sorry about that
4/14/18, 12:15 PM - Alex Starr: What could you do that would break your hope?
4/14/18, 12:15 PM - Matt Casali: It takes a toll
4/14/18, 12:16 PM - Matt Casali: Cutting myself off from her is an option but its extreme and it's not what I want to do
4/14/18, 12:17 PM - Alex Starr: Let me try a third time sorry
4/14/18, 12:17 PM - Alex Starr: With no major change, what would break your hope?
4/14/18, 12:17 PM - Matt Casali: Finding someone else that I feel strongly about is another way, but it's hard to compare relationships
4/14/18, 12:17 PM - Matt Casali: ^that's still kinda major
4/14/18, 12:17 PM - Matt Casali: Now that's a hard question
4/14/18, 12:18 PM - Matt Casali: Its hard for me to work in small movements
4/14/18, 12:18 PM - Alex Starr: It is a hard question
4/14/18, 12:18 PM - Alex Starr: But I don’t see change coming for several years
4/14/18, 12:19 PM - Alex Starr: So it’s one you have to answer if you want change at all
4/14/18, 12:21 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah I agree
4/14/18, 12:22 PM - Matt Casali: I think my feelings can be described by a narrative I tell myself
4/14/18, 12:22 PM - Alex Starr: Ok
4/14/18, 12:22 PM - Alex Starr: But fair warning that does not answer the question
4/14/18, 12:23 PM - Matt Casali: Where we discontinue things between us and we go separate ways, then later on we reach out to one another and -bringing new experiences and knowledge - we'll continue things between us
4/14/18, 12:23 PM - Matt Casali: It's something both of us have thought about
4/14/18, 12:23 PM - Matt Casali: And it makes it incredibly hard to move on
4/14/18, 12:26 PM - Alex Starr: Fair
4/14/18, 12:26 PM - Alex Starr: What would break
4/14/18, 12:30 PM - Matt Casali: What do you mean?
4/22/18, 9:08 PM - Parker: The world may never know
4/22/18, 9:10 PM - Alex Starr: I gave up lol
4/22/18, 9:11 PM - Darren: Ok
4/22/18, 9:11 PM - Darren: So
4/22/18, 9:12 PM - Matt Casali: ^
4/22/18, 9:12 PM - Darren: Here I am, looking at the whatsapp home page where I can see my different conversation threads. One of them is called sex and relationships, and the only message I can see from it is "Alex: I gave up lol"
4/22/18, 9:13 PM - Parker: HAHAHAHA
4/22/18, 9:14 PM - Collin Hurst: Gg no re
4/22/18, 9:14 PM - Alex Starr: Is there an accepted method for messaging a sigh
4/22/18, 9:15 PM - Parker: use a gif
4/22/18, 9:15 PM - Collin Hurst: Facepalm emoji
4/22/18, 9:15 PM - Collin Hurst: Or eyeroll
4/22/18, 9:15 PM - Alex Starr: Nah that’s not right
4/22/18, 9:15 PM - Alex Starr: Mildly defeated and unamused is what I’m going for

4/26/18, 8:35 AM - Alex Starr: Lazy af
4/26/18, 8:35 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah that's why I thought you guys would like her
4/26/18, 8:38 AM - Parker: Lmao
4/26/18, 8:38 AM - Parker: Nice matt she’s cute! Also good taste in music😏
4/26/18, 8:39 AM - Alex Starr: Come on that was obvious
4/26/18, 8:40 AM - Matt Casali: Yeee, she has a bunch of the same tastes as I do
4/26/18, 8:40 AM - Alex Starr: Matt u definitely have a type haha
4/26/18, 8:40 AM - Parker: No it was funny
4/26/18, 8:40 AM - Parker: it took me a second
4/26/18, 8:40 AM - Matt Casali: Never agreed with you more
4/26/18, 8:40 AM - Matt Casali: To alex
4/26/18, 8:41 AM - Parker: she also lived up to her bio
4/26/18, 8:42 AM - Alex Starr: Well I suppose I should be happy about that.  U don’t see a cow and immediately think hey Alex
4/26/18, 8:42 AM - Matt Casali: Cows are cool
4/26/18, 8:42 AM - Alex Starr: Matt I want to genocide cows
4/26/18, 8:42 AM - Matt Casali: I took a mental health first aid class
4/26/18, 8:43 AM - Matt Casali: I would like to point out, as your friend, that these self-destructive tendencies are scaring me
4/26/18, 8:43 AM - Alex Starr: Sounds about as helpful as a sharp blow to the head
4/26/18, 8:43 AM - Alex Starr: It’s not self destructive if I kill every other cow
4/26/18, 8:44 AM - Vaughn: Hahahah
4/26/18, 8:44 AM - Jason Greenberg: The real question is
4/26/18, 8:44 AM - Jason Greenberg: Is she Infinity War material?
4/26/18, 8:45 AM - Parker: I usually do lol but that wasn’t what i was looking at in the pic haha
4/26/18, 8:45 AM - Matt Casali: ? Like would I take her to infinity war?
4/26/18, 8:45 AM - Alex Starr: Wow so double bad
4/26/18, 8:46 AM - Alex Starr: No would u wage war for an eternity to return to her
4/26/18, 8:46 AM - Matt Casali: I see
4/26/18, 8:46 AM - Matt Casali: Hmm dont know yet, maybe after the next date I'll know
4/26/18, 8:47 AM - Jason Greenberg: This message was deleted
4/26/18, 8:56 AM - Parker: cuz the next date will be infinity war! gang gang
4/26/18, 8:58 AM - Jason Greenberg: Someone already spoiled it for me
4/26/18, 8:59 AM - Vaughn: https://youtu.be/L3ymBk6Vb04
4/26/18, 8:59 AM - Vaughn: That dude is not a friend
4/26/18, 9:00 AM - Tim Ko: It came out already?
4/26/18, 9:00 AM - Vaughn: Dont get any ideas tim
4/26/18, 9:00 AM - Alex Starr: ^
4/26/18, 9:06 AM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah now I already know the last infinity stone is love
4/26/18, 9:06 AM - Alex Starr: Stop
4/26/18, 9:07 AM - Jason Greenberg: It was in Thanos's heart the whole time
4/26/18, 9:07 AM - Alex Starr: I’m standing by stop
4/26/18, 9:12 AM - Vaughn: Hahahahaha stop
4/26/18, 9:12 AM - Alex Starr: Need a /s after the laughter
4/26/18, 9:57 AM - Tim Ko: Toy story 4 will have more hype than infinity war
4/26/18, 9:57 AM - Tim Ko: Change my mind
4/26/18, 9:58 AM - Vaughn: Theyre making a toy story 4?
4/26/18, 9:58 AM - Jason Greenberg: You're right tho
4/26/18, 10:11 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah
4/26/18, 10:11 AM - Tim Ko: 2020
4/26/18, 10:12 AM - Tim Ko: 2019
4/26/18, 10:51 AM - Collin Hurst: Why do I feel like she would have a show called Kegals with Keegan
4/26/18, 10:52 AM - Darren: Dafuq collin
4/26/18, 10:54 AM - Matt Casali: She would most definitely not
4/26/18, 10:54 AM - Matt Casali: Also
4/26/18, 10:54 AM - Darren: Ehhh
4/26/18, 10:55 AM - Matt Casali: Haha no way man
4/26/18, 10:56 AM - Darren: Ehhhhhhhhhhhh
4/26/18, 10:59 AM - Vaughn: <Media omitted>
4/26/18, 11:31 AM - Parker: i’m not sure why
4/26/18, 11:56 AM - Alex Starr: But I’m with you on this one collin
4/26/18, 12:06 PM - Collin Hurst: Ty
4/26/18, 10:08 PM - Matt Casali: What makes everything 500000× more difficult is that I feel like Fredi and I still have something that we both want
4/26/18, 10:09 PM - Matt Casali: And because of that I can't commit to things
4/26/18, 10:10 PM - Matt Casali: Fuck
4/26/18, 10:10 PM - Matt Casali: I'm so confused
4/26/18, 10:10 PM - Collin Hurst: I think you need to make a decision
4/26/18, 10:13 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah I think so too, but how the hell am I supposed to make it
4/26/18, 10:29 PM - Collin Hurst: Wish I could help you but I can't
4/26/18, 10:30 PM - Alex Starr: Try thinking about it as many different ways as you can.
4/26/18, 10:31 PM - Alex Starr: And by that I mean try thinking totally selfishly once, then as selflessly as possible the next time.  Give in to emotion one time, have a heart of stone the next.  See what decision you make each time
4/26/18, 10:32 PM - Alex Starr: If nothing else, it’ll be a fun distracting experiment
4/26/18, 10:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: Interesting
4/26/18, 10:36 PM - Alex Starr: Thinking certain ways will be hard but presumably you’ll get better at it
4/26/18, 10:36 PM - Alex Starr: It also doesn’t have to be all thought process based e.g. try a scenario where u drop out of college or catastrophe strikes or u win the lottery
4/26/18, 10:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: I think you and Fredi owe yourself more of a commitment in either direction. No more entire quarters in limbo where you are plagued by what ifs. For your sake once, one break is plenty
4/26/18, 10:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: You've been through some real hell for this girl, it seems like you deserve an answer
4/26/18, 10:48 PM - Alex Starr: Tho phrasing it in that manner may not be your best option, I can’t agree more with Jason on this one
4/26/18, 11:22 PM - Tim Ko: Preach it jason
4/26/18, 11:47 PM - Parker: ^
5/1/18, 9:42 PM - Parker: sometimes i feel like tristyn is flirting but sometimes i have so much doubt lol
5/1/18, 9:42 PM - Parker: idk which side to believe
5/1/18, 9:43 PM - Parker: <Media omitted>
5/1/18, 9:45 PM - Matt Casali: I feel like it's better to air on caution when it comes to flirting
5/1/18, 9:45 PM - Matt Casali: Friendliness gets mistaken for flirting so much
5/1/18, 9:46 PM - Parker: yeah which i do
5/1/18, 9:46 PM - Parker: but not just flirting
5/1/18, 9:46 PM - Alex Starr: Just ask her out damn
5/1/18, 9:47 PM - Alex Starr: You’ve been mooning over her for who knows how long
5/1/18, 9:47 PM - Alex Starr: Make a move or don’t but certainly don’t waffle
5/1/18, 9:47 PM - Matt Casali: ^
5/1/18, 9:52 PM - Parker: Most of the hesitance comes from confidence(obviously) but also cuz i feel like with time i can be more in her league cuz i think she’s too good for me if that makes sense
5/1/18, 9:52 PM - Parker: i know that sounds weird
5/1/18, 9:52 PM - Parker: fuck
5/1/18, 9:52 PM - Matt Casali: What would time change
5/1/18, 9:52 PM - Alex Starr: It doesn’t sound weird
5/1/18, 9:52 PM - Alex Starr: Abs
5/1/18, 9:52 PM - Alex Starr: Ask her out
5/1/18, 9:53 PM - Matt Casali: Parker you should definitely have the confidence to go for her
5/1/18, 9:53 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t know about that but he should definitely ask her the fuck out
5/1/18, 9:54 PM - Alex Starr: Hey tristar, wanna see a movie?
5/1/18, 9:54 PM - Alex Starr: Hey Trinidad lets go to the beach!
5/1/18, 9:54 PM - Darren: The Chris Hemsworth approach to getting the girl
5/1/18, 9:55 PM - Alex Starr: U do usually have to talk to them as well unfortunately
5/1/18, 9:56 PM - Alex Starr: Hey triangle lemme be your third leg!
5/1/18, 9:57 PM - Alex Starr: All viable asking triscuit out options
5/1/18, 9:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: Do you make your interest clear in other ways?
5/1/18, 9:58 PM - Darren: But it needs to be a somewhat natural thing to ask to do or you need way more confidence to ask
5/1/18, 9:58 PM - Alex Starr: I know I missed an obvious Trinidad and tobango pun
5/1/18, 9:59 PM - Darren: Ive been trying to get a good Tobago pun for the last 3 days
5/1/18, 10:00 PM - Alex Starr: Damn if I’d known it was in such high demand I’d have used it better haha
5/1/18, 10:04 PM - Parker: Not exactly but working out is part of it hahaha
5/1/18, 10:04 PM - Parker: in what other ways
5/1/18, 10:05 PM - Parker: It would be
5/1/18, 10:06 PM - Alex Starr: Ok hear me out
5/1/18, 10:06 PM - Alex Starr: I have basically no experience doing this but from what I’ve heard it’s really effective
5/1/18, 10:06 PM - Alex Starr: Ur instinct will be to say no but just trust me
5/1/18, 10:06 PM - Alex Starr: Ask her to dinner
5/1/18, 10:07 PM - Alex Starr: I know I know it sounds insane and ur thinking “oh god that sounds risky” and “but what if she says no?”
5/1/18, 10:07 PM - Alex Starr: But trust me it just might be crazy enough to work
5/1/18, 10:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: If someone who didn't know you two watched you interact with her, could they tell if you were interested?
5/1/18, 10:12 PM - Parker: maybe? i have no idea haha
5/1/18, 10:12 PM - Alex Starr: Ask her out
5/1/18, 10:13 PM - Alex Starr: I’m starting to think you don’t actually wanna go out with her, but just wanna discuss going out with her with us lol
5/1/18, 10:14 PM - Matt Casali: Hmmmm
5/1/18, 10:14 PM - Alex Starr: I’m running out of puns here
5/1/18, 10:15 PM - Darren: It is the best part of the dating process
5/1/18, 10:16 PM - Alex Starr: Wanna have a tryst seems obvious
5/1/18, 10:16 PM - Parker: ok fuck u
5/1/18, 10:16 PM - Parker: not true at all
5/1/18, 10:17 PM - Alex Starr: Then ask her out
5/1/18, 10:17 PM - Parker: i rarely bring her up
5/1/18, 10:20 PM - Darren: You bring her up less frequently than matt would bring up tinder updates last quarter
5/1/18, 10:20 PM - Darren: But you bring her up relatively frequently
5/1/18, 10:21 PM - Collin Hurst: Just ask her out
5/1/18, 10:21 PM - Collin Hurst: Casually for lunch
5/1/18, 10:21 PM - Alex Starr: But you’ve never asked her out so...
5/1/18, 10:21 PM - Alex Starr: Or dinner
5/1/18, 10:21 PM - Alex Starr: Or brunch
5/1/18, 10:21 PM - Alex Starr: Or to a movie
5/1/18, 10:21 PM - Alex Starr: Or do your best yogi bear and ask her to a picanic
5/1/18, 10:22 PM - Matt Casali: :/
5/1/18, 10:22 PM - Alex Starr: What’s that mean
5/1/18, 10:22 PM - Alex Starr: Do u smell toast?
5/1/18, 10:23 PM - Darren: It's his Stephen Hawking impression
5/1/18, 10:23 PM - Darren: Rip

5/1/18, 10:24 PM - Darren: Movie theater and buy dinner there
5/1/18, 10:24 PM - Darren: A romantic hotdog
5/1/18, 10:25 PM - Alex Starr: I’d say lunch but I’m biased
5/1/18, 10:25 PM - Alex Starr: So probably brunch
5/1/18, 10:27 PM - Parker: Lol darren
5/1/18, 10:27 PM - Collin Hurst: Brunch
5/1/18, 10:27 PM - Alex Starr: So you’ll ask her to brunch?
5/1/18, 10:27 PM - Parker: brunch is the goat
5/1/18, 10:27 PM - Matt Casali: Take a trip to Portland together
5/1/18, 10:27 PM - Alex Starr: When?
5/1/18, 10:27 PM - Collin Hurst: So you can save pussy for lunch
5/1/18, 10:30 PM - Parker: That’d be dope but out there for first date
5/1/18, 10:30 PM - Parker: or out of the blue
5/1/18, 10:31 PM - Alex Starr: ^
5/1/18, 10:33 PM - Matt Casali: How long have you known her again?
5/1/18, 10:33 PM - Matt Casali: Also aren't you going to a formal with her
5/1/18, 10:33 PM - Alex Starr: He is
5/1/18, 10:33 PM - Matt Casali: Just do it man
5/1/18, 10:33 PM - Alex Starr: If we were there in person, we’d be chanting ask her out
5/1/18, 10:34 PM - Matt Casali: Yep
5/1/18, 10:34 PM - Alex Starr: Or Parker can’t finish
5/1/18, 10:34 PM - Matt Casali: But yeah parker you should do a day trip type of thing
5/1/18, 10:36 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah parker I’d say u have gone way too long without making a move
5/1/18, 10:36 PM - Collin Hurst: ^
5/1/18, 10:36 PM - Tim Ko: There comes a point where u just gotta make a move
5/1/18, 10:36 PM - Collin Hurst: ^
5/1/18, 10:36 PM - Tim Ko: It doesn’t have to be an aggressive move but at least something that gets the message across
5/1/18, 10:36 PM - Ricky: I hate you ahha
5/1/18, 10:37 PM - Ricky: Parker, honestly for me, I’m a big ass pussy, so I ain’t hating on you not making a move
5/1/18, 10:37 PM - Darren: Or don't, parker. You don't owe this girl a thing
5/1/18, 10:38 PM - Tim Ko: Also how did u end up going to formal with her? Like did u ask her?
5/1/18, 10:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: You should dump her before she can dump you
5/1/18, 10:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: Its a cold world out there
5/1/18, 10:38 PM - Alex Starr: Don’t listen to ricky.  Ricky claims to be a pussy but makes moves all the time.
5/1/18, 10:39 PM - Tim Ko: ^
5/1/18, 10:39 PM - Tim Ko: And parker have confidence!
5/1/18, 10:39 PM - Alex Starr: Or don’t.  Just ask her out
5/1/18, 10:39 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah out he owes himself a nice girl
5/1/18, 10:39 PM - Parker: We were in the same pledge class last spring so a year but not close friends until 3-4 months ago
5/1/18, 10:40 PM - Parker: Im a huge pussy, thank u for understanding lol
5/1/18, 10:40 PM - Alex Starr: Goddamn it that’s no excuse
5/1/18, 10:40 PM - Matt Casali: God damn
5/1/18, 10:40 PM - Alex Starr: Ask her out
5/1/18, 10:40 PM - Parker: Hahaha im not saying its my excuse
5/1/18, 10:40 PM - Matt Casali: I'm starting to cringe at the word pussy being used like that
5/1/18, 10:40 PM - Parker: im just saying its a contributing factor and im glad he understands
5/1/18, 10:41 PM - Alex Starr: Why? Don’t be such a pussy
5/1/18, 10:41 PM - Ricky: Matt collin said he would “save the pussy for lunch”
5/1/18, 10:41 PM - Parker: Aw
5/1/18, 10:41 PM - Ricky: But you don’t like that?
5/1/18, 10:41 PM - Alex Starr: Everyone understands parker.  It’s scary.  Ask her out
5/1/18, 10:41 PM - Tim Ko: Parker it could be low key too
5/1/18, 10:41 PM - Parker: hahahaha
5/1/18, 10:42 PM - Tim Ko: Like when u guys are studying or something ask her if she’s tried a certain place
5/1/18, 10:42 PM - Tim Ko: And then be like let’s go there sometime
5/1/18, 10:42 PM - Ricky: ^^
5/1/18, 10:42 PM - Ricky: Go study with her
5/1/18, 10:42 PM - Parker: I have
5/1/18, 10:42 PM - Ricky: Surprisingly intimate
5/1/18, 10:42 PM - Alex Starr: He has
5/1/18, 10:42 PM - Ricky: Wtf, your in
5/1/18, 10:42 PM - Ricky: Hahaha
5/1/18, 10:42 PM - Ricky: You’re
5/1/18, 10:42 PM - Alex Starr: He’s done everything short of asking her out
5/1/18, 10:42 PM - Parker: but its usually not like otgether together
5/1/18, 10:42 PM - Alex Starr: Which is why
5/1/18, 10:42 PM - Alex Starr: We’ve all been saying
5/1/18, 10:42 PM - Alex Starr: Ask her out
5/1/18, 10:42 PM - Parker: like we go to the lib together
5/1/18, 10:42 PM - Ricky: Hmmmmmm
5/1/18, 10:43 PM - Parker: Like maybe next to each other
5/1/18, 10:43 PM - Parker: idk
5/1/18, 10:43 PM - Ricky: Naw go to like a place where it’s one on one but you can be loud together, and I gotta flirt with her
5/1/18, 10:43 PM - Ricky: Don’t expect her to do all the flirting, do some playful making fun of her, it’s childish but it works
5/1/18, 10:44 PM - Ricky: U*^^
5/1/18, 10:44 PM - Alex Starr: I feel like we are getting distracted
5/1/18, 10:44 PM - Matt Casali: Ask her out
5/1/18, 10:44 PM - Alex Starr: So we should pivot back to ask her out
5/1/18, 10:44 PM - Matt Casali: Ask her out
5/1/18, 10:44 PM - Tim Ko: Also if ur not too confident at first, make a situation in which she has to kinda initiate back
5/1/18, 10:44 PM - Alex Starr: There we go
5/1/18, 10:44 PM - Matt Casali: Ask her out
5/1/18, 10:44 PM - Matt Casali: Ask her out

5/1/18, 10:45 PM - Collin Hurst: Ask her out
5/1/18, 10:45 PM - Ricky: Look man, I’m scared to ask someone out unless I got validation, in my case validation has been missing them, which is pretty confident validation haha, so you do you
5/1/18, 10:45 PM - Matt Casali: Ask her out
5/1/18, 10:45 PM - Matt Casali: Ask her out

5/1/18, 10:46 PM - Matt Casali: Parker, okay, I'm gonna be completely honest
5/1/18, 10:46 PM - Ricky: Matt, he doesnt have godly good looks like you, it’s not as simple as ask em out
5/1/18, 10:46 PM - Matt Casali: You should ask her out
5/1/18, 10:46 PM - Matt Casali: Fuk u
5/1/18, 10:46 PM - Ricky: It’s genuinely tue
5/1/18, 10:46 PM - Ricky: True
5/1/18, 10:46 PM - Matt Casali: He's known her for more than a yesr
5/1/18, 10:46 PM - Ricky: That doesn’t matter
5/1/18, 10:46 PM - Darren: I was wondering how there were 60 missed messages in the span of 2 minutes
5/1/18, 10:46 PM - Matt Casali: This isn't just picking up a random girl
5/1/18, 10:46 PM - Darren: But it's just matt being a spazz
5/1/18, 10:46 PM - Matt Casali: Dont use that to degrade my advice man
5/1/18, 10:47 PM - Alex Starr: Ricky even I’m saying ask her out.  And I have the social skills and charm of a half dead crow
5/1/18, 10:47 PM - Ricky: Yes but that doesn’t mean it’s the right advise
5/1/18, 10:47 PM - Alex Starr: It absolutely is
5/1/18, 10:47 PM - Ricky: I’m saying you only got a few if one chance at this
5/1/18, 10:47 PM - Darren: One too many R's in this message
5/1/18, 10:47 PM - Ricky: And if he does it too early or does it wrong it’s all over
5/1/18, 10:48 PM - Matt Casali: But if he waits he wont have the chance
5/1/18, 10:48 PM - Matt Casali: Just fucking do it
5/1/18, 10:48 PM - Ricky: But if he jumps the gun he’s fucked
5/1/18, 10:48 PM - Alex Starr: You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take
5/1/18, 10:48 PM - Ricky: Forever launched into an awkewars abyss
5/1/18, 10:48 PM - Alex Starr: No ricky he’s not
5/1/18, 10:48 PM - Tim Ko: But parker knows her pretty well already
5/1/18, 10:48 PM - Matt Casali: If she doesn't want you now then its gonna be hard to convince her otherwise
5/1/18, 10:48 PM - Tim Ko: ^
5/1/18, 10:48 PM - Alex Starr: There are over 3.8 billion girls alive
5/1/18, 10:48 PM - Alex Starr: If he’s hung up on one forever, he’s fucked
5/1/18, 10:49 PM - Tim Ko: Parker do u think she knows ur interested in her?
5/1/18, 10:49 PM - Alex Starr: If he asks one out and gets rejected, oh well 3.8 billion left
5/1/18, 10:49 PM - Parker: Jesus guys
5/1/18, 10:49 PM - Ricky: That’s not how it worjs Alex and u know it haha
5/1/18, 10:49 PM - Parker: this is making it hard to respond lol
5/1/18, 10:49 PM - Alex Starr: But hung up forevermore and he’s never fucked
5/1/18, 10:49 PM - Alex Starr: It should be
5/1/18, 10:49 PM - Parker: I do that
5/1/18, 10:49 PM - Alex Starr: The answer is simple
5/1/18, 10:49 PM - Alex Starr: Ask her out
5/1/18, 10:49 PM - Ricky: 👌🏻❤
5/1/18, 10:49 PM - Alex Starr: We know! That’s why we keep saying ask her the fuck out
5/1/18, 10:50 PM - Parker: No like the messages that are actually important and not u and matt having parkinsons are way above
5/1/18, 10:50 PM - Matt Casali: ^
5/1/18, 10:50 PM - Parker: ^
5/1/18, 10:50 PM - Darren: Peer pressure is bad
5/1/18, 10:50 PM - Tim Ko: How well would u say u know her parker
5/1/18, 10:50 PM - Alex Starr: Disagree
5/1/18, 10:50 PM - Matt Casali: Noooooo
5/1/18, 10:50 PM - Parker: Possibly but its so hard to tell, thats my problem
5/1/18, 10:50 PM - Alex Starr: Oh my shit the answer is ask her out
5/1/18, 10:51 PM - Parker: On a scale of 1-10?
5/1/18, 10:51 PM - Alex Starr: You know one sure fire way to find out?
5/1/18, 10:51 PM - Matt Casali: Booooooooooo
5/1/18, 10:51 PM - Tim Ko: Or like give an example with other girls u know from Mv
5/1/18, 10:51 PM - Parker: Alex pls stop
5/1/18, 10:51 PM - Ricky: Alex, he wants to create something with her not just roll the dice
5/1/18, 10:51 PM - Tim Ko: Like do u know her as well as you know Shayda?
5/1/18, 10:51 PM - Ricky: It works for some people but not everyone
5/1/18, 10:51 PM - Matt Casali: Booooo
5/1/18, 10:51 PM - Alex Starr: It’s not a dice roll
5/1/18, 10:52 PM - Parker: thats hard cuz im closer friends with her and karli here than i was with girls from mv with the exxception of maybe shayda
5/1/18, 10:52 PM - Matt Casali: Parker take a chance here
5/1/18, 10:52 PM - Ricky: Rollin. A dice
5/1/18, 10:52 PM - Parker: Ricky gets me
5/1/18, 10:52 PM - Tim Ko: Oh that’s pretty good the
5/1/18, 10:52 PM - Tim Ko: Then
5/1/18, 10:52 PM - Alex Starr: But he doesn’t get you laid
5/1/18, 10:52 PM - Ricky: That’s not the goal
5/1/18, 10:52 PM - Parker: ^
5/1/18, 10:52 PM - Parker: ^
5/1/18, 10:52 PM - Matt Casali: Ricky is playing to the side of you that is hiding from the chance that she may not feel the same way
5/1/18, 10:53 PM - Alex Starr: Whatever. Emotionally laid.
5/1/18, 10:53 PM - Matt Casali: If you are confident in the way you feel about her then you should see how she feels
5/1/18, 10:53 PM - Ricky: But he isn’t is the point Matthew
5/1/18, 10:53 PM - Matt Casali: Really?
5/1/18, 10:53 PM - Ricky: It’s scary
5/1/18, 10:53 PM - Matt Casali: Cause it seems like he is
5/1/18, 10:53 PM - Ricky: Oh wait
5/1/18, 10:53 PM - Ricky: Turn it around
5/1/18, 10:54 PM - Collin Hurst: Parker check venmo
5/1/18, 10:54 PM - Ricky: He isn’t confident how she feels, sry my dislexia lookin ass
5/1/18, 10:54 PM - Matt Casali: Omg
5/1/18, 10:54 PM - Parker: collin fuck u
5/1/18, 10:54 PM - Tim Ko: Guys we should just take the middle school route at this point
5/1/18, 10:54 PM - Parker: she can see that
5/1/18, 10:54 PM - Matt Casali: And I'm sorry i used the reply function
5/1/18, 10:54 PM - Matt Casali: But this is why you fuckin ask
5/1/18, 10:54 PM - Tim Ko: Someone message her friends so that she can ask her and then she can tell her friends to tell us so we can tell parker
5/1/18, 10:54 PM - Collin Hurst: Oh shit I didn't know lol
5/1/18, 10:55 PM - Alex Starr: There we go
5/1/18, 10:55 PM - Parker: oh wait u requested it hahaha
5/1/18, 10:55 PM - Parker: Lmao
5/1/18, 10:55 PM - Parker: Ur good dont worry
5/1/18, 10:55 PM - Alex Starr: Honestly, that would be more productive than this entire conversation if you don’t wind up asking her out
5/1/18, 10:56 PM - Parker: Sure he is but he's also properly explaining how i feel
5/1/18, 10:56 PM - Parker: atleast mostly
5/1/18, 10:56 PM - Ricky: All I’m sayin is, don’t flame parker for not askin her out, if that’s ur advise, good, but he is a sweet kid lookin for happiness, not stickin his neck out and hopin for a handy
5/1/18, 10:56 PM - Alex Starr: We all understand how u feel.  We’ve all been there.
5/1/18, 10:56 PM - Matt Casali: Haha who said hes looking for a handy
5/1/18, 10:57 PM - Matt Casali: Hes looking to go on a cool date with a cool girl
5/1/18, 10:57 PM - Parker: I know but you guys are just spamming the chat instead
5/1/18, 10:57 PM - Tim Ko: Parker in all honesty, a low key lunch is a good first step
5/1/18, 10:57 PM - Parker: Ive had a lowkey lunch
5/1/18, 10:57 PM - Ricky: I imagined you saying that as a dad to a child describing the beginning stages of a relationship
5/1/18, 10:57 PM - Ricky: ❤
5/1/18, 10:57 PM - Parker: but in between classes
5/1/18, 10:57 PM - Tim Ko: One on one?
5/1/18, 10:57 PM - Matt Casali: AND A DAD HAS EXPERIENCE
5/1/18, 10:57 PM - Parker: so v lowkey
5/1/18, 10:58 PM - Ricky: You missed my point haha
5/1/18, 10:58 PM - Ricky: Look man I ain’t worked up about this, he can do what he wants
5/1/18, 10:58 PM - Alex Starr: Alright I’m out. Parker, I’m gonna say it one more time for emphasis. Please please please ask her out.
5/1/18, 10:58 PM - Ricky: I just don’t want no anger up in this here chat
5/1/18, 10:59 PM - Parker: Alex you say this like that hast gone through my head a million times...
5/1/18, 10:59 PM - Parker: Along with other things
5/1/18, 10:59 PM - Ricky: And for the record, I agree with Alex, ou should, but I think there are steps to take before then
5/1/18, 11:00 PM - Ricky: I believe in u pman
5/1/18, 11:00 PM - Ricky: Trust your gut
5/1/18, 11:00 PM - Tim Ko: ^
5/1/18, 11:00 PM - Tim Ko: Also how did u end up going to formal with her
5/1/18, 11:00 PM - Alex Starr: He has taken those steps obviously
5/1/18, 11:00 PM - Ricky: ^^
5/1/18, 11:00 PM - Ricky: If it were obvious id have agreed to ask her out
5/1/18, 11:01 PM - Alex Starr: It’s obvious to me matt and Collin whatever cuz we’ve had this conversation twice already
5/1/18, 11:03 PM - Parker: like what
5/1/18, 11:03 PM - Alex Starr: ^
5/1/18, 11:03 PM - Alex Starr: ^
5/1/18, 11:03 PM - Parker: She asked if i wanted to and i was obviously down
5/1/18, 11:03 PM - Parker: but it wasnt like a big asking lol
5/1/18, 11:03 PM - Alex Starr: ^
5/1/18, 11:04 PM - Parker: a man can only type so fast
5/1/18, 11:04 PM - Alex Starr: (Studies with her) ^
5/1/18, 11:05 PM - Alex Starr: She asked you... and no moves made?
5/1/18, 11:06 PM - Parker: oh i get what your doing lol
5/1/18, 11:06 PM - Matt Casali: You've trapped him Alex
5/1/18, 11:06 PM - Parker: does an asking to formal mean shes interested? no
5/1/18, 11:06 PM - Alex Starr: So many steps at a certain point gotten get off the wood and take the plunge
5/1/18, 11:06 PM - Parker: maybe it does
5/1/18, 11:06 PM - Alex Starr: I’d say it’s mildly indicative
5/1/18, 11:07 PM - Tim Ko: She asked u to formal...
5/1/18, 11:07 PM - Tim Ko: Wtf man lol
5/1/18, 11:07 PM - Tim Ko: That in itself should make u feel more confident
5/1/18, 11:09 PM - Ricky: Hmmmmmm
5/1/18, 11:09 PM - Ricky: I see what u mean Alex
5/1/18, 11:09 PM - Ricky: When is formal?
5/1/18, 11:09 PM - Ricky: Honestly, I’d say make a move then
5/1/18, 11:10 PM - Ricky: Dance with her, if it’s at all possible maybe go for a kiss
5/1/18, 11:10 PM - Ricky: Idk
5/1/18, 11:10 PM - Ricky: Ask her out sounds pretty good, scary but maybe soon after formal if that goes well
5/1/18, 11:11 PM - Matt Casali: Look, you're an easy going guy with an awesome sense of humor and a chill attitude. She prob asked you to formal cause she sees that and wants to spend more time with you and experience that. If you feel good about her too then this shouldn't be a debate. It shouldn't be something that's weighing you down. Just ask her on a small date or a day trip or whatever. Be confident in who you are.
5/1/18, 11:12 PM - Matt Casali: And Ricky I appreciate the advice you're giving but I think that thinking through social situations to that extent is rarely helpful
5/1/18, 11:12 PM - Matt Casali: Much better just to play it by ear
5/1/18, 11:13 PM - Tim Ko: ^
5/1/18, 11:13 PM - Parker: I mean it is her formal not mine... haha
5/1/18, 11:13 PM - Parker: That was my plan if anything
5/1/18, 11:13 PM - Tim Ko: Ya but she coulda asked any other guy
5/1/18, 11:13 PM - Parker: True
5/1/18, 11:13 PM - Tim Ko: But she code u
5/1/18, 11:13 PM - Tim Ko: Chose
5/1/18, 11:15 PM - Parker: I appreciate it :) i just have doubt and idk what to do about it
5/1/18, 11:15 PM - Matt Casali: Jesus christ what does it matter
5/1/18, 11:15 PM - Parker: Loll i was just saying i cant really ask her to her own formal
5/1/18, 11:16 PM - Parker: ignore that lol
5/1/18, 11:16 PM - Matt Casali: Doubt is probably hard to work out of but you gotta take risks
5/1/18, 11:16 PM - Parker: ^
5/1/18, 11:16 PM - Parker: i knoi think formal would be a good time
5/1/18, 11:16 PM - Parker: and we'll see what happens leading up to that
5/1/18, 11:16 PM - Matt Casali: If you take risks and things go well then the doubt starts to go away
5/1/18, 11:18 PM - Darren: But imagine how the doubts compound when she says no
5/1/18, 11:19 PM - Matt Casali: Well you just gotta take risks that are smaller and build up your confidence after that
5/1/18, 11:19 PM - Parker: youre right
5/1/18, 11:19 PM - Parker: Lol
5/1/18, 11:20 PM - Matt Casali: I mean it's a valid concern
5/1/18, 11:20 PM - Parker: it is one of many
5/1/18, 11:20 PM - Parker: well i guess the main
5/1/18, 11:20 PM - Matt Casali: But dont let it stop you from acting spontaneously and rationally
5/1/18, 11:25 PM - Tim Ko: I mean at that point it’s basically over isn’t it? Lol
5/1/18, 11:25 PM - Parker: yeah
5/1/18, 11:26 PM - Tim Ko: In fact a no is better than some ambiguous BS. You at least get to move on with ur life
5/2/18, 9:36 AM - Vaughn: Are you worried about the awkwardness of asking her and her not feeling the same way? Would it ruin a possible friendship? If shes as great as you think she is she would never hold it against you so it's a safe move regardless. 

Right now you're standing on the side of the bridge, all harnessed up. You've done your safety checks over and over again, you know youre fine, at some point you just gotta jump. Worst case scenario is you shit yourself on the way down but you definitely wont die. You'll either jumpstart the romance or strengthen your friendship. Jump pman
5/2/18, 9:40 AM - Matt Casali: Yeeee
5/2/18, 9:42 AM - Jason Greenberg: I told Haley (not current Hayley) that I thought she was cute and asked her to lunch at the start of freshman year. She said she had a boyfriend and but she was always looking for friends. It was no big deal. We are good friends now
5/2/18, 9:42 AM - Matt Casali: That's really cool
5/2/18, 9:44 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah and if Keegan hadn't talked to me about how she doesn't really want a relationship I wouldnt have known that she and I were on the same page. We would have kept the uncertainty going and things probably wouldnt have died out. But now I have a good friend.
5/2/18, 9:45 AM - Vaughn: The uncertainty kills fookin get rid of it m8
5/2/18, 9:47 AM - Jason Greenberg: ^
5/2/18, 10:28 AM - Darren: Just to be clear, these examples were all with meeting new people
5/2/18, 10:29 AM - Alex Starr: Tho while the examples weren’t particularly applicable, vaughns first message hit the nail on the head
5/2/18, 10:30 AM - Jason Greenberg: Thats true
5/2/18, 10:30 AM - Jason Greenberg: I think the takeaway is act fast or it becomes a gamble
5/2/18, 10:30 AM - Jason Greenberg: More of a gamble
5/2/18, 10:31 AM - Alex Starr: Or if u have an issue with that last part, the takeaway is act fast
5/2/18, 10:31 AM - Jason Greenberg: Higher stakes*
5/2/18, 10:31 AM - Alex Starr: That makes more sense but regardless I think matts spamming summed it up nicely
5/2/18, 10:33 AM - Matt Casali: Thank you
5/2/18, 10:39 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah I agree with Vaughn’s first message
5/2/18, 10:40 AM - Tim Ko: Also all this is assuming u are sure that u want this parker, which it seems like u do
5/2/18, 10:42 AM - Alex Starr: Even if u aren’t sure
5/2/18, 10:42 AM - Alex Starr: Being sure is overrated
5/2/18, 10:51 AM - Parker: that’s true but there’s no guarantee she doesn’t hold it against me
5/2/18, 10:52 AM - Parker: that’d be awesome if it went like that but it’s also not exactly the same situation
5/2/18, 10:55 AM - Matt Casali: Parker if you never want to ask her out, dont
5/2/18, 10:55 AM - Matt Casali: But if you do, just do it
5/2/18, 11:03 AM - Vaughn: Jasons got a point, if you and trystal are on different paths, the longer you wait the more theyll diverge
5/2/18, 11:04 AM - Vaughn: The sooner the better because itll be easier to jump paths
5/2/18, 11:05 AM - Jason Greenberg: Also remember to take good care of your teeth in your 20's
5/2/18, 11:06 AM - Jason Greenberg: A root canal at 35 is supposed to be very painful
5/2/18, 11:12 AM - Vaughn: What song was that from?
5/2/18, 11:12 AM - Vaughn: Or like audio book or somet?hing
5/2/18, 11:15 AM - Jason Greenberg: No that's just good advice
5/2/18, 11:16 AM - Jason Greenberg: It was the graduation speech to the UChicago class of 1999
5/2/18, 11:19 AM - Vaughn: https://youtu.be/sTJ7AzBIJoI
5/2/18, 11:19 AM - Vaughn: YES
5/2/18, 11:47 AM - Alex Starr: Just got this
5/2/18, 11:53 AM - Darren: What made you keep thinking about it
5/2/18, 11:55 AM - Vaughn: Hahaha good catch darren
5/2/18, 11:59 AM - Jason Greenberg: You might even say you digested it twice
5/2/18, 12:01 PM - Matt Casali: This is wonderful
5/2/18, 12:05 PM - Ricky: i dont get it ahha
5/2/18, 12:05 PM - Ricky: something about me
5/2/18, 12:05 PM - Ricky: but idk what
5/2/18, 12:09 PM - Parker: Crow minus an R equals alex
5/2/18, 12:09 PM - Parker: Hahahaha
5/2/18, 12:35 PM - Alex Starr: I think about everything I can’t figure out for the most part
5/2/18, 12:47 PM - Parker: i’m surprised u didn’t get that
5/2/18, 12:47 PM - Alex Starr: I didn’t think much about but I should’ve gotten it
5/3/18, 9:59 AM - Vaughn: https://youtu.be/n3LzrL5HlP8
5/7/18, 10:15 PM - Matt Casali: Since I feel a weird obligation to alert you guys to any developments in my romantic life:
5/7/18, 10:15 PM - Matt Casali: That girl with the amazing eyes is an equally amazing person
5/7/18, 10:15 PM - Collin Hurst: Amazing eyes?
5/7/18, 10:15 PM - Matt Casali: Basically spent the weekend with her
5/7/18, 10:16 PM - Tim Ko: Ur not obligated to haha
5/7/18, 10:16 PM - Collin Hurst: Did you boof?
5/7/18, 10:16 PM - Collin Hurst: All weekend or actually hang out all weekend
5/7/18, 10:17 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
5/7/18, 10:17 PM - Vaughn: Wowzers
5/7/18, 10:17 PM - Matt Casali: Umm no, not really
5/7/18, 10:17 PM - Matt Casali: And it was kinda all weekend
5/7/18, 10:18 PM - Vaughn: Where did she sleep?
5/7/18, 10:18 PM - Matt Casali: We slept at her place last night
5/7/18, 10:18 PM - Matt Casali: But this is not the point
5/7/18, 10:18 PM - Darren: The point is you can call matt Luigi because he's into daisy
5/7/18, 10:19 PM - Alex Starr: This is absolutely the point
5/7/18, 10:19 PM - Matt Casali: I was able to hang out with her for 3 days straight (basically) after meeting her and I'm really into her
5/7/18, 10:20 PM - Alex Starr: Or Ridley cuz he comes after daisy
5/7/18, 10:20 PM - Matt Casali: And it makes things complicated
5/7/18, 10:20 PM - Darren: Neeeeeeeerd
5/7/18, 10:20 PM - Alex Starr: Come on that was good and you know it
5/7/18, 10:20 PM - Alex Starr: U made a super Mario reference too haha
5/7/18, 10:22 PM - Alex Starr: Jokes aside matt I’m glad ur into her.  What’s amazing about her?
5/7/18, 10:26 PM - Collin Hurst: Can you send pics of the other girl too
5/7/18, 10:26 PM - Collin Hurst: I forgot who you're talking about
5/7/18, 10:26 PM - Matt Casali: What other girl
5/7/18, 10:26 PM - Collin Hurst: This
5/7/18, 10:27 PM - Darren: As her eyes
5/7/18, 10:27 PM - Matt Casali: Shes the girl I just sent the picture of haha
5/7/18, 10:27 PM - Collin Hurst: Equally
5/7/18, 10:27 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah, what Darren said
5/7/18, 10:27 PM - Darren: She is as amazing as her eyes are
5/7/18, 10:27 PM - Collin Hurst: Oh
5/7/18, 10:27 PM - Collin Hurst: Ohhhhhh
5/7/18, 10:27 PM - Alex Starr: ^
5/7/18, 10:27 PM - Matt Casali: Probably could have been worded better
5/7/18, 10:28 PM - Matt Casali: Super into photography and like all of her stuff that I've seen is amazing
5/7/18, 10:28 PM - Darren: Matt is judging women and their personalities to their bodies
5/7/18, 10:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Woweee
5/7/18, 10:28 PM - Alex Starr: Wut
5/7/18, 10:29 PM - Collin Hurst: So you did boof
5/7/18, 10:29 PM - Matt Casali: I had to write a paper going over the experiences of a bilingual person and so I basically interviewed her about her life and how her bilingualism shaped that and I got to know her really well
5/7/18, 10:29 PM - Collin Hurst: What does she speak
5/7/18, 10:29 PM - Matt Casali: Just a very wholesome, intelligent and passionate person
5/7/18, 10:29 PM - Matt Casali: Spanish and English
5/7/18, 10:29 PM - Darren: 90% of meaningful, longterm relationships start with academic interviews
5/7/18, 10:29 PM - Matt Casali: I can imagine
5/7/18, 10:30 PM - Tim Ko: Matt u should propose
5/7/18, 10:30 PM - Tim Ko: It would be a power move
5/7/18, 10:30 PM - Darren: Tim
5/7/18, 10:30 PM - Collin Hurst: Tim he doesn't need to propose to boof
5/7/18, 10:30 PM - Darren: Hahaha
5/7/18, 10:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: Person being interviewed is often flattered that you're interested minus our interview
5/7/18, 10:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: Our interview was awkward sauce
5/7/18, 10:30 PM - Matt Casali: Who's interview?
5/7/18, 10:30 PM - Darren: Did that happen
5/7/18, 10:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: But I was still into you
5/7/18, 10:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah in like junior year
5/7/18, 10:31 PM - Matt Casali: Haha wait what
5/7/18, 10:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: I never used it for the article
5/7/18, 10:31 PM - Darren: I vaguely remember that
5/7/18, 10:31 PM - Matt Casali: I half boofed
5/7/18, 10:32 PM - Alex Starr: Meaning...
5/7/18, 10:32 PM - Matt Casali: But again, that's like the least important part of what's going on her
5/7/18, 10:32 PM - Alex Starr: Like a 1 in 5 men situation?
5/7/18, 10:32 PM - Alex Starr: Bullshit but continue
5/7/18, 10:32 PM - Darren: the crowd begs to differ, matt
5/7/18, 10:32 PM - Collin Hurst: Lol
5/7/18, 10:32 PM - Matt Casali: _there was no penile penetration_
5/7/18, 10:32 PM - Collin Hurst: Ah so fingers
5/7/18, 10:32 PM - Collin Hurst: Or fist?
5/7/18, 10:33 PM - Alex Starr: God I hope not that sounds incredibly painful for you
5/7/18, 10:33 PM - Alex Starr: Other options as well
5/7/18, 10:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: FOUND THE AUDIO
5/7/18, 10:33 PM - Matt Casali: Carrots
5/7/18, 10:35 PM - Matt Casali: Anyways, just wanted to say that this girl is cool and she seems as interested in me as I am in her
5/7/18, 10:35 PM - Matt Casali: And it's at an interesting point in my life
5/7/18, 10:35 PM - Matt Casali: I'm not sure how to handle it
5/7/18, 10:36 PM - Collin Hurst: Ah so she gave you the ol French abortion I see
5/7/18, 10:36 PM - Alex Starr: Explain that real quick
5/7/18, 10:36 PM - Alex Starr: Do u want advice?
5/7/18, 10:36 PM - Collin Hurst: Blowjob
5/7/18, 10:36 PM - Alex Starr: Maybe the catholic abortion
5/7/18, 10:37 PM - Collin Hurst: If you like someone and they like you usually you get into a relationship
5/7/18, 10:37 PM - Alex Starr: But France is somewhat Protestant
5/7/18, 10:37 PM - Collin Hurst: Eventually
5/7/18, 10:37 PM - Alex Starr: Or become just like such good friends
5/7/18, 10:37 PM - Collin Hurst: I've just heard it _aight_
5/7/18, 10:37 PM - Matt Casali: She is catholic
5/7/18, 10:37 PM - Alex Starr: Not particularly apparently
5/7/18, 10:37 PM - Collin Hurst: Hehe
5/7/18, 10:37 PM - Matt Casali: You have a lot to learn kiddo
5/7/18, 10:38 PM - Tim Ko: U should go for her then
5/7/18, 10:38 PM - Alex Starr: Oh I thought u just made it up haha.  I’ll use it then
5/7/18, 10:38 PM - Tim Ko: Put fredi on the backburner
5/7/18, 10:38 PM - Collin Hurst: Continue
5/7/18, 10:39 PM - Matt Casali: I have no idea where I stand with the fredster
5/7/18, 10:39 PM - Collin Hurst: We can make up our own what's the best culture for that saying
5/7/18, 10:39 PM - Alex Starr: I can’t believe I’m saying this but tim is making total sense on this one
5/7/18, 10:39 PM - Alex Starr: Catholics for sure
5/7/18, 10:40 PM - Collin Hurst: Like she's some glazed onions on the back burner that you don't know are going on the dish or not
5/7/18, 10:40 PM - Collin Hurst: The ol Catholic abortion I like it
5/7/18, 10:40 PM - Alex Starr: He means caramelized
5/7/18, 10:40 PM - Collin Hurst: Yes
5/7/18, 10:40 PM - Alex Starr: Right?
5/7/18, 10:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: Like for yourself or for her
5/7/18, 10:42 PM - Matt Casali: No shes more like the slow braise that you put in the oven while you eat appetizers, but eventually make the appetizers your main dish and can't decide on whether to give up on the braise or put it in the fridge for later
5/7/18, 10:42 PM - Matt Casali: Both
5/7/18, 10:43 PM - Matt Casali: Talking to her about it soon though which is good
5/7/18, 10:43 PM - Alex Starr: Have u ever cooked?
5/7/18, 10:43 PM - Alex Starr: I say go for it with daffodil
5/7/18, 10:43 PM - Matt Casali: Only spaghetti
5/7/18, 10:43 PM - Collin Hurst: But you also think that you might just throw it out cause you know you're not gonna eat it later
5/7/18, 10:44 PM - Matt Casali: I mean how do I know that though
5/7/18, 10:44 PM - Tim Ko: Matt I honestly think u should at least give urself a shot with this girl and forget about fredi for the time being
5/7/18, 10:44 PM - Matt Casali: My intention was to wait for the braise to be done
5/7/18, 10:44 PM - Tim Ko: You’ve gone through way too much man
5/7/18, 10:44 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah but dude of lot of guest just showed up man
5/7/18, 10:45 PM - Collin Hurst: Gotta try out some of those appetizers
5/7/18, 10:45 PM - Alex Starr: Ok the food metaphor is clarifying nothing
5/7/18, 10:45 PM - Collin Hurst: Yes I agree
5/7/18, 10:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: Tim's got a point
5/7/18, 10:45 PM - Collin Hurst: But I like metaphors
5/7/18, 10:45 PM - Alex Starr: Right?
5/7/18, 10:45 PM - Alex Starr: Pick a new better food metaphor
5/7/18, 10:46 PM - Darren: But... Someone needs to bring Gordon Ramsey into the food metaphor
5/7/18, 10:46 PM - Collin Hurst: If you're going to stick with ONE dish the rest of your life you have to try a decent amount of them to know that it's a good decision
5/7/18, 10:47 PM - Matt Casali: But what if that first dish leaves you content every time
5/7/18, 10:47 PM - Alex Starr: And if that dish is hard to get or keeps giving u stomach cramps (even if it tastes amazing) U might want a different dish
5/7/18, 10:47 PM - Jason Greenberg: My sister kept waiting to buy her plane ticket to Amsterdam bc she thought it was gonna go down soon, but she ended up paying more money and getting a middle seat on a worse airline
5/7/18, 10:47 PM - Collin Hurst: But have you really tried the other dishes or just had a sample
5/7/18, 10:47 PM - Matt Casali: How do I know that every dish isn't gonna give me stomach cramps or icky poo
5/7/18, 10:48 PM - Alex Starr: Not the metaphor we deserved nor the metaphor we needed
5/7/18, 10:48 PM - Collin Hurst: Dafuq is that Jason
5/7/18, 10:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: I like planes!
5/7/18, 10:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: Is real
5/7/18, 10:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: Not hypothetical
5/7/18, 10:48 PM - Alex Starr: U clearly dislike trains with all this derailing going on
5/7/18, 10:48 PM - Collin Hurst: Just by looking you can tell
5/7/18, 10:48 PM - Collin Hurst: Usually
5/7/18, 10:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: Can we stop with the women as food metaphor
5/7/18, 10:49 PM - Alex Starr: Honestly?
5/7/18, 10:49 PM - Matt Casali: I dont understand
5/7/18, 10:49 PM - Matt Casali: But yeah it's a weird comparison
5/7/18, 10:49 PM - Alex Starr: All I’m saying matt is u have a choice here
5/7/18, 10:49 PM - Vaughn: Reading halfway into this convo was beyond confusing
5/7/18, 10:50 PM - Alex Starr: One route guarantees at least two more years of uncertainty and pain
5/7/18, 10:50 PM - Vaughn: I like the metaphors though
5/7/18, 10:50 PM - Alex Starr: It’s up to you and good night
5/7/18, 10:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: Good night
5/7/18, 10:50 PM - Vaughn: Gnite!
5/7/18, 10:50 PM - Alex Starr: Thanks

5/7/18, 10:50 PM - Tim Ko: Write ur name on the test
5/7/18, 10:50 PM - Collin Hurst: ^
5/7/18, 10:51 PM - Collin Hurst: Bring a #2 pencil
5/7/18, 10:51 PM - Matt Casali: I'll think about it more, you guys
5/7/18, 10:51 PM - Matt Casali: Thanks for the help and metaphors
5/7/18, 10:51 PM - Darren: How bout all the fish?
5/7/18, 10:52 PM - Tim Ko: Matt I have a question
5/7/18, 10:52 PM - Collin Hurst: No problem just remember that you can add salt
5/7/18, 10:52 PM - Tim Ko: Is it u or is it fredi or is it mural that u two don’t want to keep dating rn
5/7/18, 10:52 PM - Tim Ko: *mutual
5/7/18, 10:53 PM - Matt Casali: What's up?
5/7/18, 10:54 PM - Matt Casali: Hmmm
5/7/18, 10:55 PM - Matt Casali: Its mutual but tipped towards her pushing for it more
5/7/18, 10:56 PM - Tim Ko: I see
5/7/18, 10:59 PM - Tim Ko: Well I wish u luck on ur decision. But I really think u should at least give urself a shot. No regrets man
5/7/18, 11:00 PM - Darren: Not how this works, but good sentiment
5/8/18, 12:44 AM - Parker: Hahaha
5/8/18, 12:44 AM - Parker: i liked the metaphor
5/8/18, 12:45 AM - Parker: woweeeeee
5/10/18, 5:54 PM - Matt Casali: Break up is official with fred
5/10/18, 5:55 PM - Matt Casali: Which is something that may have not been clear to you guys previously
5/10/18, 5:57 PM - Alex Starr: It was not be had our suspicions
5/10/18, 5:57 PM - Alex Starr: I’m sorry to hear that, but also
5/10/18, 5:58 PM - Alex Starr: I have a lot of positive things to say but I think saying them would make them sound bad (due to my failing not a lack of truth) so just have some good vibes
5/10/18, 5:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: I'm sorry big guy
5/10/18, 5:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: Did it happen today?
5/10/18, 6:01 PM - Matt Casali: I'm in a really good place about it and happy so dont worry
5/10/18, 6:02 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah we just solidified it
5/10/18, 6:03 PM - Darren: Your sleeping habits seem to say you're happy
5/10/18, 6:04 PM - Vaughn: Eyyyyy ^

5/10/18, 6:05 PM - Tim Ko: ^
5/10/18, 6:05 PM - Matt Casali: Thanks guys
5/10/18, 6:06 PM - Darren: Ok, let the record show sleeping habits wasn't referring to anything sexual
5/10/18, 6:07 PM - Alex Starr: I didn’t take it as such
5/10/18, 6:07 PM - Alex Starr: There were no italics
5/10/18, 6:07 PM - Matt Casali: I def thought that's what you meant
5/10/18, 6:07 PM - Matt Casali: What did you mean
5/10/18, 6:07 PM - Alex Starr: Ur sleeping well presumably
5/10/18, 6:07 PM - Vaughn: Mhm
5/10/18, 6:07 PM - Matt Casali: But I do that even when I'm not happy
5/10/18, 6:08 PM - Darren: The fact you don't sleep in our room anymore
5/10/18, 6:08 PM - Matt Casali: So it was semi- _sexual_
5/10/18, 6:08 PM - Alex Starr: How is that not sexual
5/10/18, 6:09 PM - Matt Casali: * _semi_-sexual
5/10/18, 6:09 PM - Darren: Because last I checked he hadn't _boofed_, and I didn't know the particulars, so I kept it to what I did know for a fact
5/10/18, 6:09 PM - Darren: I'm a professional, god damnit
5/10/18, 6:09 PM - Alex Starr: I get it
5/10/18, 6:09 PM - Matt Casali: Thx

5/10/18, 6:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: Who treats you real nice ALL the time
5/10/18, 6:10 PM - Darren: That's a lot of the time
5/10/18, 6:11 PM - Alex Starr: Definitely settle for most of the time

5/10/18, 6:16 PM - Vaughn: <Media omitted>
5/10/18, 6:16 PM - Matt Casali: I liked your dating app idea
5/10/18, 6:16 PM - Matt Casali: No that girl is in linguistics with me and her and here friends are annoying
5/10/18, 6:16 PM - Vaughn: Did you swipe right on my app idea?
5/10/18, 6:18 PM - Vaughn: I imagine her voice to be like kellyns mom but a little deeper and kinda nasaly
5/10/18, 6:18 PM - Jason Greenberg: The bod of a chanti with the personality of a allie caccamo with the head of a sophia moiseyenko
5/10/18, 6:18 PM - Matt Casali: I am not down for the personality of an allie caccamo
5/10/18, 6:19 PM - Darren: Agree

5/10/18, 6:24 PM - Matt Casali: That's not what I said
5/10/18, 6:24 PM - Darren: You'd be dating a national champ
5/10/18, 6:24 PM - Vaughn: Oh shit thats true

5/10/18, 6:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: Dude she would have such a woke response tho i don't think you could handle it
5/10/18, 6:25 PM - Parker: TRUU
5/10/18, 6:25 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah chanti is a little too ripped for my taste but she still has a nice bod so it's like 9.3/10 instead of 10/10
5/10/18, 6:25 PM - Parker: I would say she’s toned not ripped
5/10/18, 6:25 PM - Darren: She is ripped and toned
5/10/18, 6:25 PM - Parker: she’s not body builder esque haha
5/10/18, 6:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: Fuck you guys tearing down my creation

5/10/18, 6:26 PM - Parker: Jason to be clear i’m not against the chanti part
5/10/18, 6:26 PM - Collin Hurst: Just looking back at her Instagram I'm correcting my assessment to 9.6/10
5/10/18, 6:26 PM - Collin Hurst: For the record
5/10/18, 6:26 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t have any social media so I’m going off of high school memories here
5/10/18, 6:26 PM - Parker: do u mean looks or brains?
5/10/18, 6:27 PM - Alex Starr: This sounds accurate
5/10/18, 6:27 PM - Parker: Atta boy
5/10/18, 6:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: Appreciate the meticulousness
5/10/18, 6:27 PM - Matt Casali: hahaha it would literally disintegrate you

5/10/18, 6:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: You should
5/10/18, 6:28 PM - Matt Casali: Chanti's cute but the freaking things she says are just too damn distracting

5/10/18, 6:32 PM - Matt Casali: That belly button is as deep as mine and as gaping wide as a girl after a devil's threesome
5/10/18, 6:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: She also dated Ryan Hammell
5/10/18, 6:33 PM - Alex Starr: I have no experience there but I think ur doing it wrong

5/10/18, 7:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: His parents are the best
5/10/18, 7:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: John too what a dude
5/10/18, 7:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ryan stole my good gun when we were playing robbers and sat down and fixed the broken one with his tools so it would be just as good

5/11/18, 12:50 AM - Tim Ko: 💜

5/22/18, 8:55 PM - Alex Starr: Not so much lol
5/22/18, 8:57 PM - Tim Ko: Naa parker only got his tippy toe on the surface of the pool
5/22/18, 8:57 PM - Alex Starr: Which frankly is the wrong tip
5/22/18, 8:57 PM - Vaughn: At least spell her name right
5/22/18, 8:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: This is napalm in the morning
5/22/18, 8:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yall are playin
5/22/18, 8:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: Making progress
5/22/18, 8:58 PM - Alex Starr: I have no idea what that means
5/22/18, 8:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: ^
5/22/18, 8:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: Neither did the vietcong
5/22/18, 8:58 PM - Darren: Parker don't surf
5/22/18, 8:59 PM - Alex Starr: No I got that it was a Vietnam war reference
5/22/18, 8:59 PM - Alex Starr: Just didn’t see relevance
5/22/18, 8:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: America always makin progress is the message
5/22/18, 8:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: And also parker
5/22/18, 9:00 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah so they’ll be dating... calculating... 17 years before the heat death of the universe at this rate
5/22/18, 9:02 PM - Collin Hurst: It's good to be at this step but he's been there for too long
5/22/18, 9:03 PM - Matt Casali: The heat death isn't the only way
5/22/18, 9:03 PM - Alex Starr: I know but it’s got a nice ring to it
5/22/18, 9:04 PM - Matt Casali: That is true
5/22/18, 9:26 PM - Tim Ko: Ya he’s been at that step longer than Ricky was going at it the one time while we were all celebrating Darren’s b day
5/22/18, 9:31 PM - Matt Casali: Eyyyyyy
5/22/18, 9:31 PM - Alex Starr: Whoa whoa
5/22/18, 9:31 PM - Alex Starr: That was like a 3/10 burn
5/22/18, 9:32 PM - Matt Casali: But i forgot about the incident
5/22/18, 9:32 PM - Matt Casali: Hence the eyyyyy
5/22/18, 9:32 PM - Alex Starr: Ah ok then it is acceptable
5/22/18, 9:32 PM - Tim Ko: It was more to resurface the incident
5/22/18, 9:32 PM - Tim Ko: Than to burn parker
5/22/18, 9:32 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah I meant as a burn on ricky
5/22/18, 9:32 PM - Darren: He's been to enough Dawson birthday events to realize how little they matter
5/22/18, 9:49 PM - Ricky: I apologize for my absence
5/22/18, 9:50 PM - Ricky: I’ll do better next time
5/22/18, 10:10 PM - Darren: Next time? There won't be a next time
5/22/18, 10:10 PM - Darren: - em
5/22/18, 10:13 PM - Ricky: I’ve morphed into an immortal comin through the portal
5/22/18, 10:14 PM - Ricky: -rick astley

5/22/18, 11:59 PM - Collin Hurst: ey this is for you not us at the end of the day its what you want

5/23/18, 12:03 AM - Matt Casali: Parker we will help you ask her out while we're there
5/23/18, 12:03 AM - Matt Casali: I'm gonna be so mad if you dont do it by the end of the quarter
5/23/18, 12:03 AM - Matt Casali: I will literally shit my pants
5/23/18, 12:04 AM - Collin Hurst: I'm thinking on monday we plan to meet her for lunch but then back out last second so they are alone and at the end he says lets do this again it was fun
5/23/18, 12:04 AM - Vaughn: Wtf dude like, in anger?
5/23/18, 12:04 AM - Matt Casali: Yes
5/23/18, 12:04 AM - Vaughn: Jesus
5/23/18, 12:05 AM - Collin Hurst: same I will actually poop and take a picture of it parker
5/23/18, 12:05 AM - Parker: don’t do that
5/23/18, 12:05 AM - Collin Hurst: maybe after that spiral down into a cocaine addiction and almost die
5/23/18, 12:06 AM - Parker: fuck that lol if i’m asking her out i’m asking her out
5/23/18, 12:06 AM - Parker: ^^
5/23/18, 12:06 AM - Collin Hurst: doesn't seem like it
5/23/18, 12:06 AM - Collin Hurst: but none of my business
5/23/18, 12:06 AM - Collin Hurst: just a side thought
5/23/18, 12:06 AM - Collin Hurst: dont mind me
5/23/18, 12:07 AM - Parker: I’m saying _if_

5/23/18, 12:09 AM - Vaughn: Then we can all huddle around and start giggling while we watch her read the note
5/23/18, 12:09 AM - Parker: i’m more down for that tbh
5/23/18, 12:09 AM - Matt Casali: And then shit our pants
5/23/18, 12:10 AM - Vaughn: Vrindas not in our group yet
5/23/18, 12:11 AM - Matt Casali: But we should be prepared
5/23/18, 12:12 AM - Collin Hurst: shiiiiiiiiiit why you gotta do vrin like that
5/23/18, 12:12 AM - Parker: Hahahaha
5/23/18, 12:12 AM - Vaughn: Lol sorry vrin

6/12/18, 1:40 PM - Parker: Aw
6/12/18, 1:41 PM - Ricky: ❤
6/12/18, 1:42 PM - Ricky: Hope it’s a good “I’m moving on” moment
6/12/18, 1:54 PM - Collin Hurst: Aw cutie
6/23/18, 11:03 PM - Matt Casali: I lied
6/23/18, 11:04 PM - Matt Casali: I cried cause I was drinking coffee --> thought about Guatemala --> thought about Fredi --> never gonna get over that --> I've felt dead for the rest of the night
6/23/18, 11:05 PM - Matt Casali: Also that whole dinner was so bland omg
6/23/18, 11:06 PM - Matt Casali: "Local Man Eats Sandwich"
6/23/18, 11:06 PM - Alex Starr: I think the odds of u never getting over it are pretty slim
6/23/18, 11:06 PM - Alex Starr: Also ^^ that haha
6/23/18, 11:07 PM - Matt Casali: But it _could_ happen
6/23/18, 11:07 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah and I could get hit by a mongoose driving a bus
6/23/18, 11:07 PM - Collin Hurst: matt stop thinking that plz it just hurts you more
6/23/18, 11:07 PM - Matt Casali: How cool would that be
6/23/18, 11:07 PM - Alex Starr: But u don’t see me running around shitless over mongoose bus drivers
6/23/18, 11:07 PM - Collin Hurst: you gotta tap in and forget
6/23/18, 11:07 PM - Vaughn: Watch 500 days of summer
6/23/18, 11:07 PM - Matt Casali: What if I only found that one person I loved and never felt the same way about anyone else
6/23/18, 11:08 PM - Matt Casali: That'd be pretty damn dope
6/23/18, 11:08 PM - Vaughn: Have you seen it?
6/23/18, 11:08 PM - Collin Hurst: not if they don't reciprocate
6/23/18, 11:08 PM - Alex Starr: Odds are pretty damn low
6/23/18, 11:08 PM - Matt Casali: But that's why it would be cool
6/23/18, 11:08 PM - Alex Starr: Is it like shitty groundhog day vaughn?
6/23/18, 11:08 PM - Matt Casali: Just like phasing through a door
6/23/18, 11:08 PM - Vaughn: Not even close
6/23/18, 11:09 PM - Matt Casali: I havent seen it
6/23/18, 11:09 PM - Vaughn: Waaaaatch it
6/23/18, 11:09 PM - Matt Casali: I'm not in a movie mood
6/23/18, 11:09 PM - Matt Casali: m00d
6/23/18, 11:10 PM - Matt Casali: I'm more in a go to sleep
6/23/18, 11:10 PM - Parker: I FEEL that
6/23/18, 11:10 PM - Alex Starr: Just looked it up, I would not like that movie
6/23/18, 11:10 PM - Parker: Matt stop saying that
6/23/18, 11:10 PM - Vaughn: I know
6/23/18, 11:10 PM - Matt Casali: Fuckin dream about Fredi giving me a hug for the fucking 17th fucking night in a row
6/23/18, 11:10 PM - Alex Starr: Do so then
6/23/18, 11:11 PM - Alex Starr: That’s not so bad
6/23/18, 11:11 PM - Vaughn: One cool thing about it is that if that pattern persists, your brain might recognize that youre dreaming while youre dreaming
6/23/18, 11:12 PM - Vaughn: And youll become lucid which is apparently super fun
6/23/18, 11:12 PM - Matt Casali: I'm not sure that I want that
6/23/18, 11:12 PM - Matt Casali: I mean it's nice feeling like its real
6/23/18, 11:12 PM - Collin Hurst: that will mean that you will have to associate seeing fredi in real life as a fantasy always
6/23/18, 11:13 PM - Matt Casali: That something as simple as making my own bomb ass spaghetti sauce made her want to overcome the distance between us
6/23/18, 11:13 PM - Matt Casali: Maybe it was already like that
6/23/18, 11:14 PM - Vaughn: Really sorry about all this matt, I cant even imagine how it feels
6/23/18, 11:14 PM - Alex Starr: Eh I feel like you definitely can
6/23/18, 11:14 PM - Matt Casali: Kinda like needing to throw up and smelling a subway sandwich to help, but it doesnt work
6/23/18, 11:15 PM - Alex Starr: K with that metaphor, u definitely need to sleep
6/23/18, 11:15 PM - Matt Casali: It was a reference lol
6/23/18, 11:15 PM - Parker: Lol
6/23/18, 11:16 PM - Vaughn: Eh i guess youre right, but my imagination would be way off
6/23/18, 11:16 PM - Matt Casali: I need to let this shit out though
6/23/18, 11:16 PM - Ricky: damn matty not being able tot get over someone is like the worst feeling ever
6/23/18, 11:16 PM - Ricky: let it out
6/23/18, 11:16 PM - Matt Casali: Its weird
6/23/18, 11:16 PM - Alex Starr: Would it tho?
6/23/18, 11:16 PM - Ricky: i cried over Alison for legit months
6/23/18, 11:17 PM - Ricky: id just tgo to sleep crying
6/23/18, 11:17 PM - Ricky: and that sounds stupid now because i have grace who is legit infinately bettter
6/23/18, 11:17 PM - Vaughn: I guess I wont know till it happens to me
6/23/18, 11:17 PM - Ricky: what happnes in this chat stays in tthtis chatt
6/23/18, 11:17 PM - Alex Starr: This is a very emotional sandwich
6/23/18, 11:17 PM - Parker: emphasis on infinitely
6/23/18, 11:17 PM - Matt Casali: I dont know if it was the meditation that I started doing or the start of smoking, but I don't think as deeply as constantly as I did a year ago
6/23/18, 11:18 PM - Vaughn: Unlike matts subway sandwhich, which was just sad
6/23/18, 11:18 PM - Matt Casali: Like it's easier to distract myself
6/23/18, 11:18 PM - Ricky: that can be good and bad
6/23/18, 11:18 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah I’m gonna say I doubt ur ability to accurately measure that matt
6/23/18, 11:18 PM - Matt Casali: Its a good short term solution
6/23/18, 11:19 PM - Matt Casali: This is the most accurate statement I can make
6/23/18, 11:19 PM - Ricky: I'm sorry matttty
6/23/18, 11:19 PM - Ricky: sry my t key is busted
6/23/18, 11:19 PM - Parker: lol
6/23/18, 11:19 PM - Vaughn: Haha
6/23/18, 11:19 PM - Parker: marty light
6/23/18, 11:20 PM - Parker: matty*
6/23/18, 11:20 PM - Matt Casali: For example: I used to imagine jumping rope in my head. Once it started - and I was sitting in a room by myself - I wouldnt be able to stop the jump rope from spinning. It would legit take me an hour. Now I can stop it easily.
6/23/18, 11:20 PM - Matt Casali: But while the jump rope was spinning, I could analyze what was happening and concentrate on other things.
6/23/18, 11:21 PM - Alex Starr: I remain skeptical tho that hardly matters
6/23/18, 11:21 PM - Matt Casali: The jump rope was just always spinning the whole time.
6/23/18, 11:21 PM - Matt Casali: Now it doesnt.
6/23/18, 11:21 PM - Alex Starr: Accepting this for now, how’s it relevant?
6/23/18, 11:21 PM - Vaughn: Maaaaybe fredi is the jumprope?
6/23/18, 11:21 PM - Vaughn: Jk idk #toodeepforme
6/23/18, 11:21 PM - Matt Casali: My attachment to her
6/23/18, 11:22 PM - Matt Casali: Close
6/23/18, 11:23 PM - Alex Starr: Please refer to my earlier messages
6/23/18, 11:23 PM - Matt Casali: Which ones exactly
6/23/18, 11:24 PM - Alex Starr: ^
6/23/18, 11:24 PM - Matt Casali: It's a feeling, nothing more
6/23/18, 11:25 PM - Matt Casali: But given the highly emotional nature of all of this, it seems relevant
6/23/18, 11:28 PM - Alex Starr: Famous last words
7/4/18, 11:31 PM - Matt Casali: Ohhhh jeez
7/4/18, 11:31 PM - Matt Casali: Just saw Fredi on tinder
7/4/18, 11:32 PM - Matt Casali: This is not a good feeling wow
7/4/18, 11:32 PM - Matt Casali: Its getting real bois
7/4/18, 11:32 PM - Matt Casali: Getting really real
7/4/18, 11:43 PM - Collin Hurst: Dang
7/4/18, 11:43 PM - Collin Hurst: Was it not real already?
7/4/18, 11:43 PM - Collin Hurst: Or you mean it just got worse
7/4/18, 11:48 PM - Matt Casali: Just got worse
7/5/18, 12:00 AM - Collin Hurst: Amn sorry man
7/5/18, 12:00 AM - Matt Casali: I became weak
7/5/18, 12:00 AM - Collin Hurst: How attached do you think you still are ?
7/5/18, 12:00 AM - Matt Casali: I texted her
7/5/18, 12:01 AM - Matt Casali: It's hard to tell
7/5/18, 12:01 AM - Matt Casali: Deoends on what time of day it is honestly
7/5/18, 12:01 AM - Collin Hurst: Nooooo matt
7/5/18, 12:02 AM - Collin Hurst: You need cold turkey
7/5/18, 12:06 AM - Matt Casali: Why do ya say that
7/5/18, 12:07 AM - Collin Hurst: Cause that's the way to do it
7/5/18, 12:07 AM - Matt Casali: I dont understand though
7/5/18, 12:07 AM - Collin Hurst: That's the best way to get over it
7/5/18, 12:07 AM - Collin Hurst: Why
7/5/18, 12:07 AM - Matt Casali: Why not just enjoy the time you have
7/5/18, 12:07 AM - Collin Hurst: Time you have with what
7/5/18, 12:08 AM - Matt Casali: With a person
7/5/18, 12:08 AM - Collin Hurst: I mean you guys broke up right
7/5/18, 12:10 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah but not cause we dont have feelings for each other
7/5/18, 12:13 AM - Collin Hurst: Do you think you will get back together in the future
7/5/18, 12:17 AM - Matt Casali: Yep
7/5/18, 12:20 AM - Collin Hurst: Well I think as long as you are thinking about her and getting back together, then all the time in between then will really suck
7/5/18, 12:22 AM - Collin Hurst: And even then you still don't know if its gonna happen, so you are stuck in purgatory until something does
7/5/18, 12:23 AM - Collin Hurst: from my exp the best thing to do is make a decision about going for it again or not, if not it's easiest just to end things permanently
7/5/18, 12:38 AM - Matt Casali: Thank you, collin
7/5/18, 12:44 AM - Collin Hurst: Np, just my advice from my experience, although mine was a little less intense
7/5/18, 12:46 AM - Matt Casali: I'm standing by my message on these grounds though
7/5/18, 12:56 AM - Collin Hurst: What was your message
7/5/18, 12:59 AM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
7/5/18, 1:48 AM - Collin Hurst: So you want to meet for coffee and do my thing?
7/5/18, 1:55 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah
7/5/18, 1:55 AM - Matt Casali: I feel like it needs to be talked about
7/5/18, 1:56 AM - Collin Hurst: Yeah I think it would be good for you
7/5/18, 1:56 AM - Matt Casali: I'm just kinda scared how shes gonna respond to it
7/5/18, 1:56 AM - Collin Hurst: Why
7/5/18, 1:58 AM - Matt Casali: I asked her if she wanted to hang out and she said she didnt want to cause she didnt want to become physical with me and I said okay
7/5/18, 1:59 AM - Matt Casali: Now I said this, and even though it's just coffee i feel like it's not gonna go over well
7/5/18, 1:59 AM - Matt Casali: I just hate being in this position
7/5/18, 1:59 AM - Collin Hurst: As long as you say you just want to talk
7/5/18, 2:00 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah and that's what I said
7/5/18, 2:00 AM - Matt Casali: Idk man
7/5/18, 2:00 AM - Matt Casali: Too much stress
7/5/18, 5:08 AM - Parker: did she respond yet?

7/5/18, 6:37 AM - Vaughn: Do you know she feels the same way?
7/5/18, 7:29 AM - Darren: I read getting physical as a physical altercation at first, which made this a pretty dramatic dilemma
7/5/18, 7:36 AM - Alex Starr: That would be an interesting turn
7/5/18, 7:58 AM - Parker: same lol
7/5/18, 7:59 AM - Alex Starr: It was a strangely 80s use of physical
7/5/18, 9:23 AM - Matt Casali: Idk you guys, let me figure this out with her and then I'll talk to yiy
7/5/18, 10:40 AM - Vaughn: Just dont keep her on a leash matt, youll always feel it tugging at you and girls like sarah will notice it

8/9/18, 12:12 PM - Collin Hurst: from fetus to fly
8/9/18, 12:12 PM - Tim Ko: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oM3kQpXRo
8/9/18, 12:14 PM - Darren: Matt was for sure projecting on Collin
8/9/18, 12:14 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah
8/9/18, 12:15 PM - Collin Hurst: lol
8/9/18, 12:15 PM - Matt Casali: Hahaha yes I think we found that out
8/9/18, 12:17 PM - Darren: Well excuse me
8/9/18, 12:18 PM - Tim Ko: Did it help discussing it tho matt?
8/9/18, 12:19 PM - Matt Casali: Haha not really
8/9/18, 12:19 PM - Matt Casali: But as always, it was nice talking
8/9/18, 1:13 PM - Matt Casali: Real talk
8/9/18, 1:13 PM - Ricky: shoot
8/9/18, 1:13 PM - Matt Casali: I seldom feel good about myself after we do a hang out
8/9/18, 1:13 PM - Matt Casali: Unless it's a workout
8/9/18, 1:13 PM - Matt Casali: Js
8/9/18, 1:14 PM - Matt Casali: I dont like it
8/9/18, 1:14 PM - Ricky: what do you think leads to that?
8/9/18, 1:14 PM - Alex Starr: And why is that
8/9/18, 1:15 PM - Alex Starr: Is it the jokes?
8/9/18, 1:15 PM - Collin Hurst: what do you mean good
8/9/18, 1:15 PM - Collin Hurst: fell good*
8/9/18, 1:15 PM - Collin Hurst: what do you mean feel good*
8/9/18, 1:15 PM - Alex Starr: I think he means self esteem wise
8/9/18, 1:15 PM - Alex Starr: Tho that makes no sense considering he feels good post workout
8/9/18, 1:15 PM - Collin Hurst: oh, cause I dont feel good cause Im sad that we cant hang out for longer
8/9/18, 1:15 PM - Alex Starr: /s
8/9/18, 1:16 PM - Vaughn: Maybe its cause we do yoga in his front lawn at 12am
8/9/18, 1:16 PM - Ricky: maybe you should just let him respond
8/9/18, 1:16 PM - Alex Starr: That would do it
8/9/18, 1:16 PM - Collin Hurst: but it couldve been sick
8/9/18, 1:16 PM - Alex Starr: Lol
8/9/18, 1:16 PM - Ricky: istead of assume
8/9/18, 1:16 PM - Vaughn: Haha my b
8/9/18, 1:16 PM - Alex Starr: I disagree
8/9/18, 1:16 PM - Ricky: i just meant in general, we do that alot
8/9/18, 1:16 PM - Collin Hurst: well might as well talk about it while we wait
8/9/18, 1:17 PM - Alex Starr: True
8/9/18, 1:17 PM - Vaughn: Bad habit sorry
8/9/18, 1:17 PM - Ricky: but it can often effect my responses
8/9/18, 1:17 PM - Ricky: and then it becomes less genuine
8/9/18, 1:17 PM - Alex Starr: Plus it’s fun to guess what you think the answer is and then also what they will say and see how all 3 line up
8/9/18, 1:18 PM - Matt Casali: I appreciate you guys thanking me for the tournament over chat last night but it just seemed like no one cared when they were here. I spent a while designing stuff, creating the tournament and making medals and they were thrown on the ground and left at my house. You guys also left in the middle of it when we could have just talked here or something. That felt bad.
8/9/18, 1:19 PM - Alex Starr: Was that unexpected?
8/9/18, 1:19 PM - Collin Hurst: well they wanted ice cream
8/9/18, 1:20 PM - Collin Hurst: and they were out of the tourney to defend them
8/9/18, 1:20 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t think is about understanding our actions
8/9/18, 1:20 PM - Collin Hurst: I feel like a lot of people assume that the thanks are automatically assumed, and therefore dont speak about it
8/9/18, 1:20 PM - Matt Casali: I also think that I'm less able to handle the intense making fun of people that everyone else is able to handle and I feel an incredibly low confidence and low self esteem whenever we're done hanging out
8/9/18, 1:21 PM - Alex Starr: What intense mockery was there?
8/9/18, 1:21 PM - Collin Hurst: also matt I think that some people didnt really want to do this tourney all that much, but came just to hang as friends and therefore were not as respectful/appreciative for the tourney as others with is understandable for me
8/9/18, 1:21 PM - Matt Casali: I cant put a finger on it alex
8/9/18, 1:22 PM - Matt Casali: The tournament is just a way that we can hang out
8/9/18, 1:22 PM - Matt Casali: Just something that we can do
8/9/18, 1:22 PM - Collin Hurst: I did fuck him up with yoshi
8/9/18, 1:22 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah Matt I was really appreciative that u put this together, but tbh I could have cared less about the actual tourney, I just wanted to hang out and be with all 9 of us together
8/9/18, 1:22 PM - Matt Casali: And I tried to put effort into making it fun for everyone
8/9/18, 1:22 PM - Tim Ko: And I had fun last night
8/9/18, 1:22 PM - Alex Starr: He said, having watched he As the entire time
8/9/18, 1:22 PM - Matt Casali: Hence why I dont understand leaving five of us here
8/9/18, 1:23 PM - Tim Ko: Was getting late and I had to go home
8/9/18, 1:23 PM - Alex Starr: You’d have stayed if we went to in n out or something
8/9/18, 1:23 PM - Tim Ko: No I wouldn’t have
8/9/18, 1:23 PM - Matt Casali: Also I appreciate that you guys may feel sorry and that you may want to apologize, I just never see its consequences when we hang out in person
8/9/18, 1:23 PM - Alex Starr: I do not feel sorry
8/9/18, 1:23 PM - Collin Hurst: feel sorry about what
8/9/18, 1:23 PM - Matt Casali: Well theres a problem there too
8/9/18, 1:24 PM - Alex Starr: I’m not going to feign liking something or disliking something to cushion self esteem
8/9/18, 1:24 PM - Alex Starr: Honesty >>>
8/9/18, 1:24 PM - Tim Ko: Also I’m sorry for not taking ur medal but giving me an 8th place ribbon just reminded me of how shitty I was lol
8/9/18, 1:24 PM - Matt Casali: Good alex
8/9/18, 1:24 PM - Matt Casali: Honesty is good
8/9/18, 1:24 PM - Collin Hurst: feel sorry about what
8/9/18, 1:24 PM - Matt Casali: But it doesnt help the fact that I'm not feeling good
8/9/18, 1:24 PM - Alex Starr: That is absolutely not your policy haha
8/9/18, 1:24 PM - Alex Starr: Mocking is honest in a way
8/9/18, 1:24 PM - Matt Casali: Fuck you, yes it is
8/9/18, 1:24 PM - Alex Starr: And you lately have been very against it
8/9/18, 1:24 PM - Matt Casali: Anyways
8/9/18, 1:24 PM - Vaughn: Similar to the jeopardy thing, i definitely think everyone enjoyed it but its a lot easier to remember the criticisms than the appreciation. Our group especially criticizes more than compliments but im sure everyone had fun/enjoyed your stuff matt
8/9/18, 1:24 PM - Matt Casali: Idk
8/9/18, 1:25 PM - Alex Starr: Plus not everyone enjoyed it
8/9/18, 1:25 PM - Matt Casali: I dont want to infer vaughn
8/9/18, 1:25 PM - Collin Hurst: what do you feel we are sorry for matt
8/9/18, 1:25 PM - Vaughn: Which one, both?
8/9/18, 1:25 PM - Matt Casali: I want to know if I'm appreciated or not
8/9/18, 1:25 PM - Matt Casali: I dont know if you're sorry for anything
8/9/18, 1:25 PM - Alex Starr: You are and you aren’t
8/9/18, 1:25 PM - Alex Starr: It’s both and neither
8/9/18, 1:25 PM - Alex Starr: We appreciated some things could do without others
8/9/18, 1:25 PM - Alex Starr: That’s true always
8/9/18, 1:26 PM - Alex Starr: And your goal should be to be secure enough that when someone doesn’t appreciate it u don’t go into a tailspin
8/9/18, 1:26 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah idk
8/9/18, 1:26 PM - Collin Hurst: specifically^
8/9/18, 1:26 PM - Matt Casali: Having constant criticism isn't healthy
8/9/18, 1:26 PM - Alex Starr: I disagree
8/9/18, 1:26 PM - Matt Casali: Positive relationships are healthy
8/9/18, 1:27 PM - Alex Starr: They are
8/9/18, 1:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: Same haha
8/9/18, 1:27 PM - Matt Casali: I disagree with your disagree
8/9/18, 1:27 PM - Alex Starr: To be fair to matt here, I also left it
8/9/18, 1:27 PM - Collin Hurst: I think they our relationships are positive, depends on how you take our jokes and banter
8/9/18, 1:27 PM - Alex Starr: Of course they are positive
8/9/18, 1:27 PM - Tim Ko: I cant speak for everyone, but I definately appreciate u. U put a lot of effort in making things happen and organize stuff and are willing to drive and use ur car to go to stuff and u definately care about us and that’s all I can really ask for from a friend.
8/9/18, 1:27 PM - Matt Casali: I dont think they're all positive in their current form
8/9/18, 1:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Matt i assumed you enjoyed the process more than the payoff. You put hella detail into everything and I thought that was just fun for you
8/9/18, 1:28 PM - Alex Starr: Which ones aren’t señor honesty?
8/9/18, 1:28 PM - Matt Casali: I like making things for other people
8/9/18, 1:28 PM - Matt Casali: The process is part of it
8/9/18, 1:28 PM - Matt Casali: But the recognition, even though it sounds fucking horrible, is a large part
8/9/18, 1:29 PM - Matt Casali: My relationship with you mainly
8/9/18, 1:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: When i made the cards against humanity deck back in hs, i spent like literally hours and hours coming up with cards and we only played with it twice haha. It was still hella fun for me to make and we did enjoy it to some degree
8/9/18, 1:29 PM - Vaughn: Do you remember feeling this way about survivor at your place?
8/9/18, 1:29 PM - Alex Starr: Ik
8/9/18, 1:29 PM - Alex Starr: I remember making the cards and that being more fun
8/9/18, 1:29 PM - Matt Casali: 150%
8/9/18, 1:29 PM - Matt Casali: We all made cards
8/9/18, 1:29 PM - Alex Starr: He looked it too
8/9/18, 1:30 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah sorry I expressed my disdain for that the whole time
8/9/18, 1:30 PM - Alex Starr: Jason parker and I did at his house for the second round
8/9/18, 1:30 PM - Alex Starr: We never even printed it
8/9/18, 1:30 PM - Vaughn: You felt it more?
8/9/18, 1:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: Thats a secondary gain that is possible to get in other ways
8/9/18, 1:30 PM - Collin Hurst: the survivor event
8/9/18, 1:30 PM - Alex Starr: So matt how would u prefer me to act?
8/9/18, 1:30 PM - Matt Casali: Survivor took a ton more effort
8/9/18, 1:30 PM - Matt Casali: Idk alex
8/9/18, 1:30 PM - Matt Casali: I cant change you
8/9/18, 1:30 PM - Matt Casali: But I also dont like our relationship
8/9/18, 1:31 PM - Matt Casali: Cause it exists only in the context of a group
8/9/18, 1:31 PM - Collin Hurst: so does a lot of relationships in this group
8/9/18, 1:31 PM - Matt Casali: I dont like it
8/9/18, 1:31 PM - Matt Casali: It feels weird to me
8/9/18, 1:32 PM - Vaughn: You get out what you put im
8/9/18, 1:32 PM - Collin Hurst: im cool with it
8/9/18, 1:32 PM - Matt Casali: Only people that know me somewhat deeply I think are Vaugun, Darren, Ricky and maybe you, Collin
8/9/18, 1:32 PM - Matt Casali: I know
8/9/18, 1:33 PM - Alex Starr: Even with our lack of outside relationship?
8/9/18, 1:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: Called out
8/9/18, 1:33 PM - Collin Hurst: oof I get a maybe
8/9/18, 1:33 PM - Matt Casali: Idk it's been more lately, Collin
8/9/18, 1:33 PM - Vaughn: I have this wierd feeling that someway, somehow, alex knows us all deeply
8/9/18, 1:33 PM - Matt Casali: I'm sorry, just trying to give all the details of what I'm feeling
8/9/18, 1:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: Its ok collin I didn't even get a mention
8/9/18, 1:33 PM - Matt Casali: Jason I barely talk with you
8/9/18, 1:33 PM - Ricky: ^
8/9/18, 1:34 PM - Collin Hurst: dont say my name at the end of each sentence plz lol uncomfy
8/9/18, 1:34 PM - Vaughn: Which is how he beat me in smash
8/9/18, 1:34 PM - Ricky: i have been feeling sad/afraid im losing you jason :(
8/9/18, 1:34 PM - Matt Casali: Sorry, collin
8/9/18, 1:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: I have been feeling similar
8/9/18, 1:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: We talk later
8/9/18, 1:34 PM - Collin Hurst: omg stop
8/9/18, 1:34 PM - Vaughn: Collin chill, collin
8/9/18, 1:35 PM - Ricky: ❤
8/9/18, 1:35 PM - Vaughn: Long distance is hard but weve built such a good foundation
8/9/18, 1:35 PM - Matt Casali: Idk...
8/9/18, 1:35 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah matt idk I feel like you have been really sensitive lately to a lot of things going on
8/9/18, 1:35 PM - Vaughn: I'll catch you guys in the retirement homes
8/9/18, 1:36 PM - Matt Casali: I've brought it up more honestly for sure
8/9/18, 1:36 PM - Matt Casali: I got a lot of stuff going on
8/9/18, 1:36 PM - Vaughn: People change, maybe matts in a different headspace than he was 2 years ago
8/9/18, 1:36 PM - Collin Hurst: its not bad or good, just different and thats hard to adjust too
8/9/18, 1:36 PM - Collin Hurst: to
8/9/18, 1:36 PM - Alex Starr: Matt I’m sorry I make you feel bad
8/9/18, 1:37 PM - Alex Starr: But u understand the equivalency here right?
8/9/18, 1:37 PM - Matt Casali: Not really, but I want to
8/9/18, 1:39 PM - Matt Casali: I mean obviously I went through a traumatic experience with a significant relationship in my life. Its forced me to examine what I want out of my relationships and the more I look at my relationship with the herd, the more I find myself trying to get something different out of it
8/9/18, 1:39 PM - Matt Casali: So I bring up stuff more often now
8/9/18, 1:39 PM - Alex Starr: We both want change in the others actions
8/9/18, 1:40 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah I see that
8/9/18, 1:40 PM - Collin Hurst: real talk
8/9/18, 1:41 PM - Vaughn: Idk all this effort to stir things up could end up spilling something. I feel like you have awesome intentions but you ask for change too fast. It can be subtle and if you put effort into changing our dynamic, Im sure it can happen
8/9/18, 1:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: Which doesn't work. You gotta change yourself or your attitude
8/9/18, 1:42 PM - Collin Hurst: i agree
8/9/18, 1:42 PM - Matt Casali: Thing is, that I dont want to be the one putting effort in anymore
8/9/18, 1:42 PM - Matt Casali: I feel like it's all I do
8/9/18, 1:42 PM - Matt Casali: I dont want to be the only one
8/9/18, 1:42 PM - Vaughn: Go with the flow
8/9/18, 1:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: So dont
8/9/18, 1:42 PM - Matt Casali: Fuck
8/9/18, 1:42 PM - Vaughn: We all want whats best for the herd
8/9/18, 1:43 PM - Vaughn: We'll gravitate towards an awesome relationship
8/9/18, 1:43 PM - Matt Casali: Of course you do, but no one acts on it
8/9/18, 1:43 PM - Vaughn: Let it be man
8/9/18, 1:43 PM - Matt Casali: Or a horrible one
8/9/18, 1:43 PM - Matt Casali: Theres things I want to do
8/9/18, 1:43 PM - Vaughn: Then do them with the people who want to
8/9/18, 1:43 PM - Collin Hurst: but its different for you, in my eyes without having any effort (emotional reflection) I have grown closer to people this summer
8/9/18, 1:43 PM - Alex Starr: Maybe?
8/9/18, 1:43 PM - Matt Casali: Im scared they wont happen if I dont push for them
8/9/18, 1:43 PM - Collin Hurst: compared to when we were away in school
8/9/18, 1:44 PM - Collin Hurst: I agree with vaughn here
8/9/18, 1:45 PM - Tim Ko: The way I look at us, I just feel very appreciative that I have a group of friends back home that I can hit up anytime and just hang out with
8/9/18, 1:45 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah and its important to just let things be, if you start growing apart from someone its for a reason, and you cant force otherwise
8/9/18, 1:45 PM - Matt Casali: I need more than that
8/9/18, 1:46 PM - Matt Casali: If I grow apart I'm sucked back in by this chat
8/9/18, 1:46 PM - Matt Casali: And I'm not just gonna leave this chat
8/9/18, 1:46 PM - Ricky: this is gonna sound pretty fucked but if people are being honest this is what i am viewing, If every single time matt is disappointed and sad when we hang with him, we are being bad/ destructive friends for and to him. It kinda feels like we are a girlfriend that is invested in time wise but isnt wanting to put in the same amount of effort, which is so fucked for him, it kinda sounds like potential break up territory tbh
8/9/18, 1:46 PM - Alex Starr: Fuck that forced what you want in a lot of cases
8/9/18, 1:47 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah, effort levels are what I've thought a lot about
8/9/18, 1:47 PM - Matt Casali: I cant help the amount of effort i put into something
8/9/18, 1:47 PM - Collin Hurst: kinda true, it sounds like a lot of people are together on the same page and are happy where we are, but matts just not
8/9/18, 1:48 PM - Matt Casali: This is important: the effort i put into something is nearly impossible to change
8/9/18, 1:48 PM - Matt Casali: Even if its not being reciprocated
8/9/18, 1:48 PM - Vaughn: Why is yours impossible and what are you asking about ours?
8/9/18, 1:49 PM - Vaughn: Not trying to be blunt just short on time and trying to understand
8/9/18, 1:49 PM - Matt Casali: I cant change how much I care about something
8/9/18, 1:49 PM - Matt Casali: And I'm not sure you guys can either
8/9/18, 1:50 PM - Collin Hurst: but you can change how much you expect to get out from it
8/9/18, 1:50 PM - Matt Casali: So I'm trying to find a way that we can find a way to work our two different approaches to this group together
8/9/18, 1:50 PM - Ricky: I think the fact that we are a friend group and not a grilfriend might be contributing,
i honestly put more effort into my relationship with grace and whne i wasnt dating someone I did things like drive all the way to SB just to see jason, luckily he is a person who can reciprocate with infinite amounts of love, but its hard to do the same for the whole herd
8/9/18, 1:51 PM - Matt Casali: That's probably it
8/9/18, 1:51 PM - Matt Casali: Trying to fill a vacuum
8/9/18, 1:51 PM - Ricky: ^
8/9/18, 1:51 PM - Matt Casali: And you guys aren't super used to me when I'm not in a relationship
8/9/18, 1:51 PM - Ricky: i felt the exact same way
8/9/18, 1:51 PM - Matt Casali: At least not in the context of a grouo
8/9/18, 1:51 PM - Alex Starr: Ive stopped trying because nothing worked
8/9/18, 1:51 PM - Ricky: that makes total sense
8/9/18, 1:51 PM - Matt Casali: So this seems unnatural
8/9/18, 1:51 PM - Matt Casali: But it's how I always am
8/9/18, 1:51 PM - Ricky: and thats one of the best parts about you
8/9/18, 1:52 PM - Ricky: the problem is, our group belittles that because most people are incapable of matching it
8/9/18, 1:52 PM - Collin Hurst: im not a go with the flow guy but in this case gotta let it flow
8/9/18, 1:52 PM - Matt Casali: What are you asking me to do, collin
8/9/18, 1:52 PM - Ricky: You can with Fred because she prob does similar effort favors in return
8/9/18, 1:52 PM - Matt Casali: Plz be more specific
8/9/18, 1:52 PM - Matt Casali: Yep
8/9/18, 1:52 PM - Alex Starr: That’s an awfully fucking rosy picture
8/9/18, 1:53 PM - Ricky: i mean, its kinda true
8/9/18, 1:53 PM - Ricky: matt is full of the amount of want to express love that most people arent used to so can't/dont recipricate
8/9/18, 1:53 PM - Alex Starr: I think it’s maybe a little true
8/9/18, 1:53 PM - Alex Starr: That is not why it’s belittled
8/9/18, 1:53 PM - Ricky: we just arent a girlfriend
8/9/18, 1:53 PM - Ricky: sorry yeah wrong word
8/9/18, 1:53 PM - Alex Starr: I disagree with causality
8/9/18, 1:53 PM - Ricky: but i suck with words
8/9/18, 1:54 PM - Alex Starr: Oh no we belittle the shit out of it
8/9/18, 1:54 PM - Ricky: the point is, Matt, i genuinly believe you need a girlfriend or better friends
8/9/18, 1:54 PM - Ricky: for that sort of thing
8/9/18, 1:54 PM - Collin Hurst: if you thinnk that you cant change your levels of effort, then you have to accept that we cant change ours
8/9/18, 1:54 PM - Matt Casali: I do
8/9/18, 1:54 PM - Matt Casali: That's why I said this
8/9/18, 1:55 PM - Tim Ko: Matt did u feel this way when u were dating fredi?
8/9/18, 1:55 PM - Matt Casali: With you guys?
8/9/18, 1:55 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah
8/9/18, 1:55 PM - Matt Casali: No
8/9/18, 1:55 PM - Tim Ko: I see
8/9/18, 1:55 PM - Matt Casali: ^
8/9/18, 1:56 PM - Alex Starr: Better friends is going to be tricky lol
8/9/18, 1:56 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah seems accurate
8/9/18, 1:56 PM - Alex Starr: We knew this
8/9/18, 1:56 PM - Matt Casali: I have good friends at school
8/9/18, 1:56 PM - Alex Starr: We still have no solution
8/9/18, 1:56 PM - Matt Casali: But they're at school
8/9/18, 1:56 PM - Ricky: Matt, I think you should push your time toward making people happy who can reciprocate your levels rather than ask those who cant to change
8/9/18, 1:56 PM - Tim Ko: Do ur friends at school fill that void?
8/9/18, 1:56 PM - Collin Hurst: I just think a shit ton of this comes from the relationship with fredi, and that you need to fix that first before coming here
8/9/18, 1:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: Dude we are not responsible for making him happy
8/9/18, 1:57 PM - Ricky: which is why i said he should get better friends
8/9/18, 1:57 PM - Alex Starr: Jason idk what happened, but we agree more and more lol
8/9/18, 1:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lol
8/9/18, 1:57 PM - Ricky: honestly
8/9/18, 1:57 PM - Tim Ko: ^
8/9/18, 1:57 PM - Matt Casali: Blech
8/9/18, 1:57 PM - Matt Casali: I feel gross
8/9/18, 1:57 PM - Matt Casali: I'm done
8/9/18, 1:57 PM - Ricky: MAtt you shouldn't feel gross
8/9/18, 1:57 PM - Ricky: its not ur fualt
8/9/18, 1:57 PM - Alex Starr: We got all of our disagreement out of the way in six months and presto.
8/9/18, 1:57 PM - Ricky: its just who you are
8/9/18, 1:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: Bazinv
8/9/18, 1:58 PM - Ricky: and our group is what it is
8/9/18, 1:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: G
8/9/18, 1:58 PM - Collin Hurst: like we have been the same friend group for a while and your breakup with fredi changed things, but I dont understand why we have to change our whole dynamic because of that
8/9/18, 1:58 PM - Alex Starr: It’s one of the few times when I think we’ve had a major scuffle resolved on both sides with very positive outcomes
8/9/18, 1:59 PM - Matt Casali: You and I have _very_ different ideas of what a friendship is
8/9/18, 1:59 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t think
8/9/18, 1:59 PM - Alex Starr: So
8/9/18, 1:59 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz when have you tried to make one of us happy?
8/9/18, 1:59 PM - Ricky: this is a little unfair
8/9/18, 1:59 PM - Ricky: he deff has
8/9/18, 1:59 PM - Alex Starr: Sounds dickish but serious question (obviously phrased badly)
8/9/18, 2:00 PM - Alex Starr: No he’s done things that would make him happy if we were him
8/9/18, 2:00 PM - Matt Casali: I can't believe this haha
8/9/18, 2:00 PM - Matt Casali: Fucking last nifht
8/9/18, 2:00 PM - Matt Casali: Jesus christ
8/9/18, 2:00 PM - Ricky: he has made me happy
8/9/18, 2:00 PM - Tim Ko: Maybe a viable solution is to think about getting into a relationship
8/9/18, 2:00 PM - Alex Starr: I’m not denying that
8/9/18, 2:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: I think so. I know I can be good a friend to you but at the end of the day its not up to me how you feel
8/9/18, 2:01 PM - Alex Starr: ^
8/9/18, 2:01 PM - Collin Hurst: true
8/9/18, 2:01 PM - Tim Ko: Guys I think we can go about this in a better way
8/9/18, 2:01 PM - Matt Casali: Fucking hell
8/9/18, 2:01 PM - Alex Starr: You wanted honesty
8/9/18, 2:01 PM - Ricky: chillll he knows its honestly you dont gotta point it out
8/9/18, 2:02 PM - Tim Ko: Will be ironic but can we try to empathize with him rn?
8/9/18, 2:02 PM - Alex Starr: Ur right that’s my bad
8/9/18, 2:02 PM - Tim Ko: Ironic as in me saying it
8/9/18, 2:02 PM - Tim Ko: Cuz apparently I’m bad at empathizing
8/9/18, 2:02 PM - Alex Starr: I _always_ do
8/9/18, 2:02 PM - Collin Hurst: like when I want to hang out with vaughn, its not because I think oh I want to improve my relationship with vaughn we should hang out, i just feel like it, it should feel natural
8/9/18, 2:02 PM - Ricky: that statement is not what time is advocating for ahah
8/9/18, 2:02 PM - Alex Starr: Tim that was so mature. I am not being sarcastic
8/9/18, 2:03 PM - Matt Casali: I don't want you guys to feel like you're the only thing stopping me from diving into depression. I want you to feel some responsibility for my happiness because you are my close friends
8/9/18, 2:03 PM - Matt Casali: You don't own my happiness
8/9/18, 2:03 PM - Alex Starr: I mean that as a high compliment
8/9/18, 2:03 PM - Matt Casali: but I expect you to try and help me attain it
8/9/18, 2:03 PM - Alex Starr: Will u reciprocate?
8/9/18, 2:04 PM - Matt Casali: Alex you fucking fuck
8/9/18, 2:04 PM - Matt Casali: Yes i will
8/9/18, 2:04 PM - Matt Casali: I have tried to sooo much
8/9/18, 2:04 PM - Ricky: Matt, if you can tell me how, I will try to help
8/9/18, 2:04 PM - Matt Casali: Over and over again
8/9/18, 2:04 PM - Alex Starr: Letting me make jokes is probably the fastest way
8/9/18, 2:04 PM - Alex Starr: Now will you?
8/9/18, 2:04 PM - Matt Casali: Maybe rick, but I'm so fucking pissed off right now at everyone else its hard for me to find a way
8/9/18, 2:04 PM - Collin Hurst: im pretty damn happy rn with everyone in the herd
8/9/18, 2:04 PM - Matt Casali: I want to work with you on this
8/9/18, 2:04 PM - Matt Casali: And I've tried to find a way
8/9/18, 2:04 PM - Matt Casali: or talk about it even
8/9/18, 2:05 PM - Alex Starr: I’m usually happy to talk about it
8/9/18, 2:05 PM - Tim Ko: Matt how are u overall? Are u only feeling sad after u hang out with us?
8/9/18, 2:05 PM - Matt Casali: Pretty much
8/9/18, 2:06 PM - Tim Ko: So ordinarily when ur doing ur own thing, it’s generally ok?
8/9/18, 2:06 PM - Ricky: I think there is alot going on, and too many people watching, matt, you should just message alex individually. No eyes on, one on one
8/9/18, 2:06 PM - Alex Starr: I really prefer the group chat
8/9/18, 2:07 PM - Ricky: if you wanna try and help matt
8/9/18, 2:07 PM - Alex Starr: I occasionally seem to need a translator
8/9/18, 2:07 PM - Ricky: then tis not really you, its you through a translator
8/9/18, 2:07 PM - Alex Starr: Yes it is
8/9/18, 2:07 PM - Alex Starr: Or rather it’s better than no understanding
8/9/18, 2:07 PM - Tim Ko: Cuz if it’s only us that’s making u feel sad, I’d say maybe take a break from us for a bit and see how it feels
8/9/18, 2:08 PM - Alex Starr: Plus I have dentist in 7 minutes
8/9/18, 2:08 PM - Alex Starr: Even tho we don’t want to see you go
8/9/18, 2:08 PM - Tim Ko: Like maybe delete the chat for a week
8/9/18, 2:08 PM - Matt Casali: can't do that tim
8/9/18, 2:08 PM - Tim Ko: Why?
8/9/18, 2:08 PM - Matt Casali: its not gonna change anything
8/9/18, 2:08 PM - Alex Starr: So matt what did u want to talk about with me?
8/9/18, 2:09 PM - Tim Ko: U don’t know that
8/9/18, 2:09 PM - Alex Starr: Say your piece
8/9/18, 2:10 PM - Vaughn: The group chat definitely has this stage dynamic where subtle backhands and less emotion are the norm. Definitely not the most optimal for getting some of our issues figure out
8/9/18, 2:10 PM - Matt Casali: The problem for me is in all of us
8/9/18, 2:10 PM - Matt Casali: Leaving won't change you
8/9/18, 2:10 PM - Alex Starr: I disagree of course less emotion is the key to figuring  it out
8/9/18, 2:10 PM - Ricky: matt gonna be honest, this is kinda close minded on ur part, sounds like you arent willing to change urself
8/9/18, 2:10 PM - Alex Starr: That’s asking an awful lot
8/9/18, 2:12 PM - Collin Hurst: i still think that a lot of this stems from fredi and that it would be best to sort that out before expecting us to all change
8/9/18, 2:12 PM - Matt Casali: I'm including myself in that statement
8/9/18, 2:12 PM - Alex Starr: ^^
8/9/18, 2:12 PM - Matt Casali: I'm a huge part of the problem
8/9/18, 2:12 PM - Matt Casali: I agree with this
8/9/18, 2:12 PM - Matt Casali: But I want to start a conversation here
8/9/18, 2:12 PM - Alex Starr: I’m down tho again dentist
8/9/18, 2:13 PM - Tim Ko: Matt do u think ur missing the affection that ur used to with being in a relationship
8/9/18, 2:15 PM - Matt Casali: Yes, but I think that's only tangentially related
8/9/18, 2:16 PM - Alex Starr: I think it’s fully intertwined
8/9/18, 2:17 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah, cause I feel like we have been as tight a group as before
8/9/18, 2:17 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah tho we are out of the phase of increasing tightness
8/9/18, 2:18 PM - Collin Hurst: like I dont think that much has changed on the group side
8/9/18, 2:18 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah but so it goes we are in college and growing up rip
8/9/18, 2:19 PM - Tim Ko: I dont think we as ur closests friends can fill that void left by not being in a relationship even if we tried or hardest. We can help u get through it, but we can’t be that thing that ur missing
8/9/18, 2:19 PM - Collin Hurst: well last thing I heard tim does have a vagina
8/9/18, 2:21 PM - Tim Ko: That made me smile actually^ more cuz it was a quintessential collin thing to say
8/9/18, 2:22 PM - Collin Hurst: I smiled at the fact that you smiled when reading that you have a vagina
8/9/18, 2:22 PM - Matt Casali: I don't need you guys to be my girlfriends
8/9/18, 2:22 PM - Matt Casali: I just think I need more supportive friends
8/9/18, 2:23 PM - Matt Casali: Or I don
8/9/18, 2:23 PM - Matt Casali: *dont
8/9/18, 2:23 PM - Matt Casali: Who the fuck knows
8/9/18, 2:42 PM - Matt Casali: I expressed my feelings and I'm okay with what I said. What I want to say now, though, is that I'm sorry that I continue to do it and put this stress and tension in your guys' lives. I need to work stuff out on my own. I want you guys in my life and I can't imagine what it would be like if you weren't. I just want to know that you'll attempt to work with me on stuff.
8/9/18, 2:48 PM - Ricky: ❤
8/9/18, 2:49 PM - Collin Hurst: ❤❤
8/9/18, 2:50 PM - Vaughn: Matt just letting you know youre surely not the only one that has questioned the validity of our groups friendship. This whole group means more than anything to me right now and therefor I've put a lot of trust into everyone in the group to maintain our friendship. At this point I have so little doubt that things will change for the worse that I've gotten to the point where I dont question it anymore. Everytime you speak up it helps all of us so please keep being you and i'll try to be a better me
8/9/18, 2:51 PM - Matt Casali: Thanks vaughn, I'll do that
8/9/18, 3:28 PM - Darren: I just watched The Post, and this conversation was more dramatic than yhat
8/9/18, 3:30 PM - Alex Starr: I have not seen the post
8/9/18, 3:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: Summary or you didnt see it
8/9/18, 3:32 PM - Alex Starr: Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep shoot porno and Hanks is shockingly huge
8/9/18, 3:32 PM - Alex Starr: So they called it the post
8/9/18, 3:33 PM - Ricky: lol
8/9/18, 3:33 PM - Collin Hurst: nice
8/9/18, 3:41 PM - Darren: It's about the Washington Post releasing the Pentagon papers
8/9/18, 3:44 PM - Vaughn: They released them on their finsta right? Hence the post
8/9/18, 3:44 PM - Matt Casali: well there wouldn't be any consequences if they had done that
8/9/18, 5:31 PM - Parker: Hi just read this on my break. i can say more later when i have more time but i agree with a lot of what jason said about it’s not our responsibility. Matt we all know you’re in a rough situation rn but i do think you’re asking a lot of us that’s not all that possible. We all do care about the relationships we have here even if they’re to varying amounts, people show their affection and care in different ways and it seems that anything we’ve done lately is just not good enough for you which kinda hurts
8/9/18, 5:31 PM - Parker: you guys are always important to me more than u know but especially with the rough start i had to summer you guys are almost all i had to turn on to get my mind off of it and get advice from
8/9/18, 5:32 PM - Parker: It’s still not easy for me but you guys have played a big part in helping
8/9/18, 5:32 PM - Parker: gotta go back to work but i want u to know i really do care matt
8/9/18, 5:33 PM - Alex Starr: And I want reiterate some apathy for balance
8/9/18, 5:37 PM - Darren: I would rather not participate in the group than try to raise my commitment / effort levels substantially
8/9/18, 5:37 PM - Parker: You can only go up my friend
8/9/18, 5:39 PM - Alex Starr: On the other hand, I’m happy to up my effort level
8/9/18, 5:39 PM - Alex Starr: I think I could say waaaaay more hurtful stuff and probably funnier stuff too
8/9/18, 5:40 PM - Alex Starr: Or just end any sort of filter
8/9/18, 5:40 PM - Tim Ko: I think I’ll work on not saying random useless shit as much in the chats
8/9/18, 5:40 PM - Tim Ko: Would be a benefit to everyone involved
8/9/18, 5:40 PM - Collin Hurst: lol
8/9/18, 5:40 PM - Collin Hurst: we all say useless shit
8/9/18, 5:40 PM - Alex Starr: Stick to playoffs and major comebacks lol
8/9/18, 5:41 PM - Alex Starr: Whoa whoa whoa
8/9/18, 5:41 PM - Darren: But 99% is a high rate that only Tim has
8/9/18, 5:41 PM - Tim Ko: I’ll stick to serious discussions and maybe a rare joke
8/9/18, 6:18 PM - Parker: Lol we all do tim
8/9/18, 6:18 PM - Parker: Maybe not some insignificant As game though purely because u know no one cares
8/13/18, 4:15 PM - Tim Ko: Should I message someone on ig that I don’t know but we have mutual friends. Yay or nay
8/13/18, 4:15 PM - Darren: It depends
8/13/18, 4:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: Only for networking
8/13/18, 4:17 PM - Collin Hurst: depends on situation
8/13/18, 4:17 PM - Tim Ko: Like what
8/13/18, 4:21 PM - Darren: Describe yours
8/13/18, 4:23 PM - Tim Ko: She plays soccer at Oregon, is friends with like 5-6 ppl I know from my church. Never seen her personally.
8/13/18, 4:25 PM - Tim Ko: I think my biggest fear is that she would tell ppl from my church which would be a little embarrassing I guess
8/13/18, 4:25 PM - Tim Ko: Other than that I figured I’d never see her irl so idgaf lol
8/13/18, 4:25 PM - Collin Hurst: I would message her
8/13/18, 4:25 PM - Collin Hurst: just ask if she wants to grab coffee or something
8/13/18, 4:26 PM - Tim Ko: Gang aight
8/13/18, 4:26 PM - Tim Ko: It’s not that wierd to message her right?
8/13/18, 4:28 PM - Collin Hurst: thats how matt mett fredi
8/13/18, 4:29 PM - Darren: And boy did that go well
8/13/18, 4:29 PM - Collin Hurst: maybe consult him on how to get that going
8/13/18, 4:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: your intentions become immediately obvious but its also flattering
8/13/18, 4:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: its like super super liking some on tinds
8/13/18, 4:31 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah
8/13/18, 4:31 PM - Tim Ko: I just don’t want this to be something I regret badly
8/13/18, 4:32 PM - Tim Ko: Which atm I don’t see why I would
8/13/18, 4:45 PM - Alex Starr: I wanted to see “gee whiz” but haha all the same
8/13/18, 4:52 PM - Matt Casali: Yes?
8/13/18, 4:53 PM - Darren: Gee whiz
8/13/18, 4:53 PM - Matt Casali: Aight
8/13/18, 4:53 PM - Alex Starr: Bang up job
8/13/18, 4:53 PM - Matt Casali: Ftr it did go well
8/13/18, 4:53 PM - Alex Starr: Gotta start somewhere
8/13/18, 4:54 PM - Alex Starr: “A life without regret is hardly worth living”
8/13/18, 4:54 PM - Matt Casali: I've never regretted reaching out to someone. Regardless of a response or not
8/13/18, 4:55 PM - Collin Hurst: there is a small chance that you could get murdered because of it tho
8/13/18, 4:55 PM - Alex Starr: According to my quote you need to work on that haha
8/13/18, 4:55 PM - Alex Starr: But it’s so small who would notice
8/13/18, 4:55 PM - Matt Casali: Never said I dont have regrets
8/13/18, 4:57 PM - Alex Starr: You should have regrets on all fronts was part of the message
8/13/18, 4:58 PM - Alex Starr: Perhaps “a road without regret is hardly worth traveling” would’ve been more apt but I’m not made of words damn it
8/13/18, 4:58 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah I’m just trying not to sound too creepy lol
8/13/18, 4:59 PM - Alex Starr: Eh it’s only creepy if she doesn’t find you attractive
8/13/18, 4:59 PM - Alex Starr: No pressure
8/13/18, 5:00 PM - Darren: True
8/13/18, 5:00 PM - Tim Ko: That’s true so I guess I’m trying to be as less creepy as possible
8/13/18, 5:00 PM - Alex Starr: While still messaging her
8/13/18, 5:00 PM - Tim Ko: Yup
8/13/18, 5:01 PM - Alex Starr: An important distinction
8/13/18, 5:02 PM - Alex Starr: I’d ask what she looks like but that feels redundant somehow
8/13/18, 5:02 PM - Tim Ko: You could just look up the Oregon soccer roster and find the Asian one
8/13/18, 5:02 PM - Collin Hurst: pics pics
8/13/18, 5:03 PM - Alex Starr: Damn she’s on the soccer team?
8/13/18, 5:03 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah
8/13/18, 5:03 PM - Tim Ko: Go big or go home
8/13/18, 5:04 PM - Alex Starr: Wait I thought u were only interested in relationships.  How’s it gonna work with you leaving in 10 days and her being 8 hours a way in 6 weeks?
8/13/18, 5:04 PM - Collin Hurst: ^
8/13/18, 5:04 PM - Tim Ko: I mean I just wanna get to know her a little
8/13/18, 5:05 PM - Tim Ko: Then maybe hit her up when back
8/13/18, 5:05 PM - Alex Starr: I retract my damn
8/13/18, 5:05 PM - Tim Ko: But that’s thinking too far ahead
8/13/18, 5:05 PM - Alex Starr: Tho there is more than one Asian
8/13/18, 5:06 PM - Darren: Just send some god damn pics
8/13/18, 5:07 PM - Collin Hurst: 6
8/13/18, 5:07 PM - Collin Hurst: ^^*
8/13/18, 5:07 PM - Tim Ko: <Media omitted>
8/13/18, 5:07 PM - Collin Hurst: oo mvla pride
8/13/18, 5:08 PM - Tim Ko: Be honest, too pretty for me?
8/13/18, 5:09 PM - Collin Hurst: eh thats not really a thing
8/13/18, 5:09 PM - Collin Hurst: in general
8/13/18, 5:09 PM - Darren: It can be
8/13/18, 5:10 PM - Collin Hurst: it can be but you never know what she likes
8/13/18, 5:10 PM - Alex Starr: It absolutely is a thing
8/13/18, 5:10 PM - Alex Starr: Not necessarily in this case
8/13/18, 5:10 PM - Collin Hurst: ok it is a thing but not for everyone
8/13/18, 5:11 PM - Alex Starr: It is
8/13/18, 5:11 PM - Alex Starr: For everyone
8/13/18, 5:11 PM - Alex Starr: To varying degrees and kinds of pretty
8/13/18, 5:11 PM - Collin Hurst: ughhhh ok its a thing for everyone but the range differs
8/13/18, 5:11 PM - Collin Hurst: plus tim you just got to bbe confident
8/13/18, 5:11 PM - Tim Ko: I feel like in this case I’m messeging her out of the blue so it matter more
8/13/18, 5:11 PM - Alex Starr: Maybe but only one way to find out
8/13/18, 5:11 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah true lol
8/13/18, 5:11 PM - Tim Ko: Exactly
8/13/18, 5:12 PM - Collin Hurst: dew it
8/13/18, 5:12 PM - Alex Starr: Besides the advantage of her being religious is she probably won’t cruelly reject you
8/13/18, 5:12 PM - Alex Starr: Just politely
8/13/18, 5:12 PM - Alex Starr: Tho then again not necessarily tactfully
8/13/18, 5:12 PM - Tim Ko: Lol true
8/13/18, 5:13 PM - Ricky: Do it tim, she is really cute In an innocent way that makes it seem like she would at the very least appreciate it if you approached you respectively
8/13/18, 5:13 PM - Alex Starr: Tim doesn’t approach himself anymore
8/13/18, 5:13 PM - Alex Starr: Or doesn’t help himself approach?
8/13/18, 5:13 PM - Alex Starr: Eh you get the idea
8/13/18, 5:13 PM - Tim Ko: Ayeee
8/13/18, 5:14 PM - Tim Ko: Thx guys for the advice, I def have more confidence now
8/13/18, 5:14 PM - Alex Starr: Damn despite my half assed efforts
8/13/18, 5:14 PM - Alex Starr: Good on you
8/13/18, 5:19 PM - Matt Casali: Soccer has the most attractive girls out of any other sport
8/13/18, 5:19 PM - Matt Casali: She cute tim, send her a message!
8/13/18, 5:19 PM - Ricky: I would argue softball can compete
8/13/18, 5:20 PM - Matt Casali: Soccer has a way higher percentage of attractive girls
8/13/18, 5:20 PM - Darren: Sample size issues
8/13/18, 5:20 PM - Matt Casali: Theres more than 30 girls in each sport
8/13/18, 5:20 PM - Matt Casali: We're in safe territory
8/13/18, 5:20 PM - Collin Hurst: beat me to it lol
8/13/18, 5:21 PM - Darren: 30 people total play softball, and one of them is Mr schynert
8/13/18, 5:21 PM - Collin Hurst: rugby tho
8/13/18, 5:21 PM - Darren: You should date one of the UCSC rugby girls
8/13/18, 5:21 PM - Matt Casali: I think I saw one cute one
8/13/18, 5:21 PM - Darren: They're almost always on the opers field
8/13/18, 5:22 PM - Darren: Shrek or Frankenstein's monster?
8/13/18, 5:22 PM - Collin Hurst: ill pass
8/13/18, 5:22 PM - Matt Casali: Shrek
8/13/18, 5:22 PM - Collin Hurst: thanks for the offering
8/13/18, 5:22 PM - Matt Casali: Its rude to decline
8/13/18, 5:22 PM - Collin Hurst: fuck and chuck at most
8/13/18, 5:23 PM - Matt Casali: Duck and cluck at least
8/13/18, 5:24 PM - Darren: But like, volleyball
8/13/18, 5:24 PM - Matt Casali: Girls in soccer are usually more attractive then volleyball in my experience
8/13/18, 5:24 PM - Matt Casali: *than
8/13/18, 5:26 PM - Matt Casali: https://m.ranker.com/list/female-sports-with-the-hottest-athletes/the-round-mound
8/13/18, 5:26 PM - Matt Casali: I guess I'm wrong
8/13/18, 5:27 PM - Collin Hurst: I agree with that article
8/13/18, 5:27 PM - Ricky: Half of those aren’t sports hahaha
8/13/18, 5:28 PM - Collin Hurst: exactly
8/13/18, 5:28 PM - Ricky: Although beach volleyball is a good #1
8/13/18, 5:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: Soccer is hotter and vb girls might be mean
8/13/18, 5:38 PM - Ricky: Jason you by law have to back me up in the softball claim
8/13/18, 5:39 PM - Collin Hurst: hahaha
8/13/18, 5:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: Eh
8/13/18, 5:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: I'm partial to a good freestyle aerobics team
8/13/18, 5:50 PM - Ricky: Haha
8/13/18, 5:56 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
8/13/18, 5:58 PM - Alex Starr: Ice dancing
8/13/18, 6:23 PM - Ricky: Dancing. True good point
8/13/18, 6:23 PM - Alex Starr: Dance isn’t a sport
8/13/18, 6:23 PM - Alex Starr: But I guess ice dancing is?
8/13/18, 6:31 PM - Darren: Aye, Tonya
8/13/18, 6:32 PM - Ricky: Haha that’s where I’m confused
8/13/18, 6:32 PM - Ricky: You can deff compete In dance
8/13/18, 6:35 PM - Matt Casali: Not in the same way as conventional sports though
8/13/18, 6:37 PM - Alex Starr: Olympics = sports
8/13/18, 6:37 PM - Collin Hurst: ^
8/13/18, 6:38 PM - Alex Starr: U can compete in anything
8/13/18, 6:38 PM - Collin Hurst: although its subjective af and I hate that
8/13/18, 6:38 PM - Ricky: So is lots of olympics haha
8/13/18, 6:38 PM - Collin Hurst: yup and I hate a lot of olympic sports
8/13/18, 6:38 PM - Collin Hurst: well not hat ebut dislike

8/13/18, 6:54 PM - Alex Starr: Ur not wrong
8/13/18, 6:55 PM - Darren: Alright
8/13/18, 7:03 PM - Parker: ^
8/13/18, 7:03 PM - Parker: At oregon it’s volleyball over soccer for sure
8/13/18, 7:03 PM - Parker: but soccer is far less of a focus there
8/13/18, 7:03 PM - Parker: so i don’t know the team really
8/13/18, 7:03 PM - Alex Starr: Haha quick pivot
8/13/18, 7:04 PM - Parker: so that’s why u asked me about her tim ;))
8/13/18, 7:04 PM - Parker: go for it
8/13/18, 7:05 PM - Alex Starr: Wouldn’t that be a fat guy winking?
8/13/18, 7:05 PM - Tim Ko: 😂😂
8/13/18, 7:05 PM - Tim Ko: Totally forgot about that
8/13/18, 7:06 PM - Parker: But also keep in mind with her being an athlete at oregon you won’t be the only guy in her dms so be nice about it which i know u will be
8/13/18, 7:06 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah ik haha
8/13/18, 7:06 PM - Tim Ko: I’m not really even expecting a response tbh
8/13/18, 7:11 PM - Matt Casali: That's the spirit
8/13/18, 7:11 PM - Alex Starr: It’s a spirit at the very least
8/13/18, 7:11 PM - Alex Starr: Tho assuming success is usually the best way to achieve it
8/13/18, 7:11 PM - Ricky: You do you tim
8/13/18, 7:12 PM - Ricky: Leave and learn
8/13/18, 7:12 PM - Ricky: Live*
8/13/18, 7:12 PM - Alex Starr: He doesn’t do that anymore damn it
8/13/18, 7:13 PM - Ricky: Why? Wut?
8/13/18, 7:13 PM - Alex Starr: Ya I’m not explaining that joke lol
8/13/18, 7:15 PM - Darren: Ur not wrong
8/13/18, 7:16 PM - Ricky: Ohhhh is that lime a masterbation thing? I’m confused
8/13/18, 7:17 PM - Alex Starr: It is a repeat joke I’ll admit that
8/13/18, 7:17 PM - Ricky: Like*
8/13/18, 7:17 PM - Alex Starr: That’s a bingo
8/13/18, 9:23 PM - Alex Starr: Tim did u message her?
8/13/18, 9:39 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah
8/13/18, 9:39 PM - Tim Ko: No response lol
8/13/18, 9:39 PM - Tim Ko: Feel kind wierd haha
8/13/18, 9:39 PM - Tim Ko: Kinda regret it
8/13/18, 9:39 PM - Collin Hurst: How long
8/13/18, 9:39 PM - Collin Hurst: What platform
8/13/18, 9:39 PM - Tim Ko: Not cuz she didn’t respond more cuz it’s kinda creepy
8/13/18, 9:39 PM - Tim Ko: Insta
8/13/18, 9:39 PM - Alex Starr: It’s a nice step forward
8/13/18, 9:39 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
8/13/18, 9:39 PM - Alex Starr: Eh it’s merely forward
8/13/18, 9:40 PM - Collin Hurst: How long has it been
8/13/18, 9:40 PM - Alex Starr: Forward is different than creepy
8/13/18, 9:40 PM - Tim Ko: Messaged her around 5:30
8/13/18, 9:40 PM - Tim Ko: I said: Hey Jessica! You probably don’t know me but I’m kind of a new fan of Oregon soccer and I hear you are from the bay
8/13/18, 9:40 PM - Tim Ko: That’s not that weird right?
8/13/18, 9:40 PM - Alex Starr: Creepy is sneaking around
8/13/18, 9:40 PM - Alex Starr: Okay perhaps it was not forward
8/13/18, 9:41 PM - Collin Hurst: Don't worry about it, it hasn't been that long
8/13/18, 9:41 PM - Alex Starr: But it doesn’t seem creepy
8/13/18, 9:41 PM - Alex Starr: Don’t worry about it regardless
8/13/18, 9:41 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah
8/13/18, 9:41 PM - Tim Ko: I just feel weird doing it lol
8/13/18, 9:41 PM - Collin Hurst: Messages from people who aren't you're friend have this weird thing where you have to accept your message and you can miss it easily
8/13/18, 9:42 PM - Alex Starr: Eh it felt weird the first time you put on a baseball glove
8/13/18, 9:42 PM - Tim Ko: Nah she already accepted my follow request
8/13/18, 9:42 PM - Alex Starr: This is the same thing and eventually you won’t drop the ball
8/13/18, 9:42 PM - Darren: Strange comparison
8/13/18, 9:42 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
8/13/18, 9:42 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz it wasn’t overtly sexual?
8/13/18, 9:42 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah I’ll be back to school in a week and I’ll totally forget about everything haha
8/13/18, 9:42 PM - Alex Starr: I could’ve gone into this whole thing about the fingers fitting just right
8/13/18, 9:43 PM - Tim Ko: Just hope she doesn’t tell her friends that know me lol
8/13/18, 9:43 PM - Alex Starr: Tim if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that people forget a lot
8/13/18, 9:43 PM - Alex Starr: Even if she does tell, everyone will forget in a week
8/13/18, 9:43 PM - Tim Ko: True
8/13/18, 9:44 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah and I see those ppl max twice a year anyways
8/13/18, 9:44 PM - Tim Ko: Since we all in college
8/13/18, 9:44 PM - Alex Starr: I won’t tho so don’t dm me on insta
8/13/18, 9:44 PM - Tim Ko: Alex u need to make an insta
8/13/18, 9:44 PM - Tim Ko: Or a finsta
8/13/18, 9:44 PM - Alex Starr: That sounds like a disaster
8/13/18, 9:44 PM - Matt Casali: Stating your intentions for reaching out in that context are super important
8/13/18, 9:45 PM - Alex Starr: Eh not everyone has your tact
8/13/18, 9:46 PM - Matt Casali: That's besides the point
8/13/18, 9:46 PM - Alex Starr: No
8/13/18, 9:46 PM - Alex Starr: It is not
8/13/18, 9:46 PM - Alex Starr: It means that different routes maximize success based on ability
8/13/18, 9:47 PM - Alex Starr: As well as personal comfort and style
8/13/18, 9:48 PM - Matt Casali: But, like why are you telling her that you know shes from the bay and that your a fan of the Oregon soccer team? Do you want to get a ticket to a game? Are you trying to fuck her tonight?
8/13/18, 9:49 PM - Matt Casali: It would be different if it were in person
8/13/18, 9:49 PM - Alex Starr: No he wants to gain experience talking to girls
8/13/18, 9:49 PM - Alex Starr: And figure things out and how it works for him
8/13/18, 9:49 PM - Matt Casali: Talking to girls isn't just mining xp
8/13/18, 9:49 PM - Alex Starr: Would more directness help, possibly.  But also it might make it less likely to message at all
8/13/18, 9:50 PM - Alex Starr: Plus i just generally am not a fan of unsolicited advice
8/13/18, 9:50 PM - Matt Casali: They're people and you need to go in to a conversation expecting that you're creating a relationship with another person
8/13/18, 9:51 PM - Alex Starr: Wow deep
8/13/18, 9:51 PM - Matt Casali: Oh I didnt realize it was unsolicited
8/13/18, 9:52 PM - Alex Starr: I’m not sure he doesn’t want help but he didn’t ask for it
8/13/18, 9:54 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah I didn’t wanna be too creepy
8/13/18, 9:55 PM - Alex Starr: Alright time to completely jump ship and give unsolicited advice
8/13/18, 9:56 PM - Alex Starr: Tim I think matt is right and you would tend to lean toward the not so forward side and some more forwardness probably wouldn’t hurt
8/13/18, 10:01 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah true, was kinda interesting doing it, never done it before so cool experience
8/13/18, 10:02 PM - Collin Hurst: I agree with matt a little on the message, but I also don't think its too late for a second
8/13/18, 10:02 PM - Tim Ko: Lolol
8/13/18, 10:02 PM - Alex Starr: Eh when you think there’s no hope for a reply couldn’t hurt too badly
8/13/18, 10:02 PM - Tim Ko: If the A’s win the World Series I’ll send a second one
8/13/18, 10:03 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah exactly
8/13/18, 10:03 PM - Tim Ko: Low risk move
8/13/18, 10:03 PM - Matt Casali: That's too late for a second one
8/13/18, 10:03 PM - Collin Hurst: Nahhh
8/13/18, 10:03 PM - Alex Starr: 2046 is a bit late
8/13/18, 10:03 PM - Collin Hurst: Def not especially if that message had the wrong 'message'
8/13/18, 10:04 PM - Tim Ko: Was I not direct enough with the message?
8/13/18, 10:04 PM - Tim Ko: Like too vague
8/13/18, 10:04 PM - Tim Ko: On my intentions
8/13/18, 10:04 PM - Alex Starr: It is admittedly not clear that you want any kind of relations
8/13/18, 10:04 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah true
8/13/18, 10:04 PM - Tim Ko: Oh I see
8/13/18, 10:04 PM - Alex Starr: Whether diplomatic or sexual
8/13/18, 10:04 PM - Alex Starr: Or both
8/13/18, 10:04 PM - Collin Hurst: Didn't even really give her any proposal to accept or reject if she wanted to
8/13/18, 10:05 PM - Collin Hurst: But it's not too late imo
8/13/18, 10:05 PM - Tim Ko: I feel like tho I followed her out of the blue and then messaged her
8/13/18, 10:05 PM - Tim Ko: Is that not enough of a message?
8/13/18, 10:05 PM - Alex Starr: Again worst case you are a tad embarrassed and after dancing in front of the entire school how bad could that be?
8/13/18, 10:06 PM - Collin Hurst: lol
8/13/18, 10:09 PM - Tim Ko: Dancing wasn’t that bad haha
8/13/18, 10:10 PM - Alex Starr: Compared to...?
8/13/18, 10:10 PM - Alex Starr: I’m not saying it was that bad but what have you had that was worse
8/13/18, 10:10 PM - Tim Ko: Like more embarrassing?
8/13/18, 10:10 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah
8/13/18, 10:12 PM - Tim Ko: Uhh idk maybe public speaking
8/13/18, 10:12 PM - Tim Ko: That always sucks
8/13/18, 10:12 PM - Alex Starr: Eh to each there own
8/13/18, 10:15 PM - Matt Casali: Just tell her why you're messaging her, chances are that she's not going to want to guess
8/13/18, 10:15 PM - Collin Hurst: Exactly
8/13/18, 10:16 PM - Collin Hurst: Just add on  would you want to get coffee or something like that
8/13/18, 10:17 PM - Alex Starr: Again, not because I think clarifying is necessary but just cuz, he means tell her what you want to do with her initially rather than why you’re messaging her
8/13/18, 10:17 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah I prob should have
8/13/18, 10:18 PM - Collin Hurst: Should still
8/13/18, 10:18 PM - Tim Ko: Ehh too late now, next time haha
8/13/18, 10:18 PM - Collin Hurst: No
8/13/18, 10:18 PM - Collin Hurst: Do it now !
8/13/18, 10:18 PM - Tim Ko: I feel like she’s not interested
8/13/18, 10:18 PM - Collin Hurst: She's not interested in random strangers just making statement towards her
8/13/18, 10:20 PM - Matt Casali: Preach
8/13/18, 10:20 PM - Tim Ko: True lol
8/13/18, 10:20 PM - Tim Ko: Ehh next time
8/13/18, 10:20 PM - Collin Hurst: Wtf
8/13/18, 10:20 PM - Alex Starr: She might be but it won’t get you anywhere also, told you so collin and matt
8/13/18, 10:21 PM - Alex Starr: It doesn’t matter how right you are if you can’t convince people to do it
8/13/18, 10:21 PM - Collin Hurst: If you agree then...second message man
8/13/18, 10:21 PM - Alex Starr: Ironically you were too direct collin/matt haha
8/13/18, 10:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: This seems like a mountain outa a molehill situation
8/13/18, 10:22 PM - Matt Casali: It most definitely is
8/13/18, 10:22 PM - Jason Greenberg: Idk tim dont take it hard it aint a big deal
8/13/18, 10:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: Get tinder/christian mingle and then we'll have some real convos
8/13/18, 10:23 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
8/13/18, 10:23 PM - Collin Hurst: Cmom man
8/13/18, 10:23 PM - Collin Hurst: Second message what can you lose
8/13/18, 10:23 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah I wasn’t expecting too much so it’s all good
8/13/18, 10:23 PM - Tim Ko: Just seems desperate
8/13/18, 10:23 PM - Tim Ko: And more creepy
8/13/18, 10:24 PM - Collin Hurst: It's not
8/13/18, 10:24 PM - Alex Starr: Told ya too direct won’t happen now
8/13/18, 10:24 PM - Collin Hurst: Who cares
8/13/18, 10:25 PM - Collin Hurst: Just unfinished business that's all
8/13/18, 10:25 PM - Tim Ko: I feel like if she found me attractive in anyway she woulda at least opened the message
8/13/18, 10:26 PM - Alex Starr: Not true
8/13/18, 10:26 PM - Matt Casali: ^
8/13/18, 10:26 PM - Collin Hurst: It's been like 5 hours man
8/13/18, 10:26 PM - Collin Hurst: When I messaged Dillion she didn't reply for 5 days
8/13/18, 10:26 PM - Collin Hurst: And then I got her snap in like 10 messages after that
8/13/18, 10:26 PM - Tim Ko: U matched on tinder tho
8/13/18, 10:27 PM - Alex Starr: Not relevant
8/13/18, 10:27 PM - Parker: ^
8/13/18, 10:27 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah doesn't mean much
8/13/18, 10:27 PM - Alex Starr: Guys this isn’t the way to convince I said for the fifth time
8/13/18, 10:27 PM - Parker: your message was pretty vague i agree with matt
8/13/18, 10:27 PM - Collin Hurst: Im calling  for a second message
8/13/18, 10:27 PM - Parker: not completely but you should atleast hint at what you want
8/13/18, 10:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: If you message 100 girls you more likely to get a response. There are prop 99 reasons why you wouldn't get a response
8/13/18, 10:28 PM - Alex Starr: Being so direct will not make it happen
8/13/18, 10:28 PM - Collin Hurst: Tim if you dont message a second time I'm not going to revive you during fortnite tn
8/13/18, 10:28 PM - Alex Starr: Confusingly worded but accurate
8/13/18, 10:28 PM - Parker: But to be fair not every random message in a dm is to pursue a relationship and something sexual
8/13/18, 10:28 PM - Tim Ko: Alright fine haha
8/13/18, 10:28 PM - Tim Ko: What should I say
8/13/18, 10:29 PM - Matt Casali: ^
8/13/18, 10:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah i agree with parker you're not sexual enough
8/13/18, 10:29 PM - Tim Ko: “Would like to get to know u when ur back in the bay”?
8/13/18, 10:29 PM - Parker: ^
8/13/18, 10:29 PM - Parker: not what i’m saying haha
8/13/18, 10:29 PM - Collin Hurst: Do you want a signature? Do you want to rob her house?
8/13/18, 10:29 PM - Parker: Tim said it was obvious because he followed her and then messaged her but i’m saying that isn’t always the case
8/13/18, 10:30 PM - Collin Hurst: Can't believe I had to go there to get him to send something
8/13/18, 10:30 PM - Tim Ko: I just want to start out being friends with her
8/13/18, 10:30 PM - Tim Ko: Lolol
8/13/18, 10:30 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah ask to go lut for coffee
8/13/18, 10:30 PM - Alex Starr: I told you six times you would damn it
8/13/18, 10:30 PM - Collin Hurst: Out
8/13/18, 10:30 PM - Tim Ko: Ok, “would like to hang out when ur back in the bay”
8/13/18, 10:30 PM - Collin Hurst: you're
8/13/18, 10:31 PM - Alex Starr: Would u?
8/13/18, 10:31 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah
8/13/18, 10:31 PM - Parker: i’d say coffee
8/13/18, 10:31 PM - Matt Casali: "You seem cool and if you're down, I'd like to hang out when you're back in the bay!"
8/13/18, 10:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: Nope
8/13/18, 10:31 PM - Parker: not if you’re down
8/13/18, 10:31 PM - Parker: if you’re free
8/13/18, 10:31 PM - Tim Ko: Why not “if you’re down”
8/13/18, 10:31 PM - Matt Casali: Haha I feel like it makes no difference
8/13/18, 10:31 PM - Matt Casali: No idea
8/13/18, 10:32 PM - Parker: Lol nah it’s fine
8/13/18, 10:32 PM - Alex Starr: Cuz it implies u might’ve forced her hahaha
8/13/18, 10:32 PM - Tim Ko: I don’t want to pressure her or anything
8/13/18, 10:32 PM - Collin Hurst: "Would you like to get coffee sometime when you're back home?
8/13/18, 10:32 PM - Parker: that’s what karli said when i first asked out tristyn
8/13/18, 10:32 PM - Alex Starr: It’s like saying “honestly”
8/13/18, 10:32 PM - Parker: but it kinda made sense
8/13/18, 10:32 PM - Matt Casali: This is nice
8/13/18, 10:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: Wait for her to respond a few times before you ask her to do something
8/13/18, 10:32 PM - Parker: ^
8/13/18, 10:32 PM - Tim Ko: That was my thought initially
8/13/18, 10:32 PM - Matt Casali: Nooo booooooo
8/13/18, 10:32 PM - Collin Hurst: Ikr you could slide those words right into the pussy
8/13/18, 10:32 PM - Matt Casali: Booooo
8/13/18, 10:32 PM - Matt Casali: Booooooooo
8/13/18, 10:33 PM - Parker: this is exactly what we are saying to not do lol
8/13/18, 10:33 PM - Parker: or opposites of what we’re saying haha
8/13/18, 10:33 PM - Alex Starr: Hey don’t lump me in there
8/13/18, 10:33 PM - Alex Starr: I’m with Jason (usually am on this sort of thing by default)
8/13/18, 10:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: That date on the first message shit _only_ works if you are an actual model
8/13/18, 10:34 PM - Tim Ko: ^thats what I thought
8/13/18, 10:34 PM - Matt Casali: No it does not
8/13/18, 10:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: Um ok matt
8/13/18, 10:34 PM - Parker: We’re not saying he should land a date on the first message
8/13/18, 10:34 PM - Collin Hurst: ^
8/13/18, 10:34 PM - Tim Ko: But that’s what I’m asking for tho
8/13/18, 10:35 PM - Jason Greenberg: Like wair
8/13/18, 10:35 PM - Parker: but should’ve made his intentions a little more clear
8/13/18, 10:35 PM - Jason Greenberg: wait
8/13/18, 10:35 PM - Parker: we know tim
8/13/18, 10:35 PM - Matt Casali: This is not a real conversation
8/13/18, 10:35 PM - Jason Greenberg: I agree there should be an action item
8/13/18, 10:35 PM - Matt Casali: Otherwise I'd agree with you, jason
8/13/18, 10:35 PM - Collin Hurst: At the very least
8/13/18, 10:35 PM - Alex Starr: But it could move the conversation along instead
8/13/18, 10:35 PM - Jason Greenberg: But that is not the time to ask
8/13/18, 10:35 PM - Alex Starr: Just as an option
8/13/18, 10:35 PM - Jason Greenberg: Right
8/13/18, 10:36 PM - Alex Starr: The current thing doesn’t require a response
8/13/18, 10:36 PM - Alex Starr: Asking a question or something does
8/13/18, 10:36 PM - Matt Casali: I'm regretting this convo
8/13/18, 10:36 PM - Matt Casali: Or at least being a part of it haha
8/13/18, 10:36 PM - Alex Starr: As soon as someone mentions ur looks or for some other reason?
8/13/18, 10:36 PM - Alex Starr: I’d deliberately avoided mention
8/13/18, 10:37 PM - Tim Ko: I really appreciate ur advice tho
8/13/18, 10:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: My b
8/13/18, 10:37 PM - Matt Casali: Noooo
8/13/18, 10:37 PM - Matt Casali: No haha I dont care about that
8/13/18, 10:37 PM - Matt Casali: I just think that we're mulling this over too much
8/13/18, 10:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: ^ move on
8/13/18, 10:38 PM - Matt Casali: I liked the idea tim had about just using this as a test
8/13/18, 10:38 PM - Alex Starr: Only because certain people (not tim) mulled it over too little initially
8/13/18, 10:38 PM - Matt Casali: I mean, still be aware that this is a real person
8/13/18, 10:38 PM - Alex Starr: Oh that’s good to know
8/13/18, 10:39 PM - Alex Starr: That’s a tad condescending
8/13/18, 10:39 PM - Matt Casali: But the experience in taking a step out of your comfort zone is important
8/13/18, 10:39 PM - Tim Ko: So should I or not
8/13/18, 10:39 PM - Tim Ko: I want to be considerate of her
8/13/18, 10:39 PM - Matt Casali: Didnt mean for it to be
8/13/18, 10:39 PM - Matt Casali: What do you think tim?
8/13/18, 10:40 PM - Tim Ko: Well I feel like the fact that she ignored my first message is a sign that she isn’t interested and tho asking her may invoke a response, it probably would be a no
8/13/18, 10:41 PM - Tim Ko: Plus she’s never even been aware that I existed and me asking her to hang out I feel is kinda wierd
8/13/18, 10:41 PM - Matt Casali: I think you're probably right in not sending a second message right away, but probably for the wrong reason
8/13/18, 10:42 PM - Tim Ko: What should be the reason?
8/13/18, 10:42 PM - Collin Hurst: Wrong
8/13/18, 10:43 PM - Matt Casali: Cause you should probably just wait, cause it takes time for a response
8/13/18, 10:46 PM - Tim Ko: Ahh ok
8/13/18, 10:47 PM - Tim Ko: Also I just learned u can unsend a message lol
8/13/18, 10:47 PM - Tim Ko: I might just do that hahahah
8/13/18, 10:47 PM - Tim Ko: No evidence
8/13/18, 10:47 PM - Alex Starr: Fuck no
8/13/18, 10:47 PM - Alex Starr: Sorry
8/13/18, 10:47 PM - Alex Starr: _fuck_ no
8/13/18, 10:48 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
8/13/18, 10:49 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah tim that's a no no
8/13/18, 10:49 PM - Collin Hurst: Worst idea of tonight by far
8/13/18, 10:49 PM - Tim Ko: Why haha
8/13/18, 10:49 PM - Alex Starr: I haven’t suggested things worse which is shocking
8/13/18, 10:50 PM - Alex Starr: It’s... ignoble
8/13/18, 10:50 PM - Vaughn: How about, "my friend is bugging me to ask for your number"
8/13/18, 10:51 PM - Alex Starr: He’s not dming collin
8/13/18, 10:53 PM - Parker: tim don’t do that wtf lol
8/13/18, 10:53 PM - Parker: And 5 hours isn’t that long
8/13/18, 10:53 PM - Tim Ko: What wrong if I do it haha
8/13/18, 10:54 PM - Parker: because it looks even weirder
8/13/18, 10:54 PM - Parker: and it’s not even weird rn
8/13/18, 10:54 PM - Matt Casali: You said you had nothing to lose
8/13/18, 10:54 PM - Matt Casali: And yeah
8/13/18, 10:54 PM - Matt Casali: Its not even weird
8/13/18, 10:54 PM - Parker: you’re over thinking this tim
8/13/18, 10:54 PM - Parker: she hasn’t responded and not much more to that
8/13/18, 11:00 PM - Tim Ko: Well I did say that if she told my church friends it would be kinda awkward
8/13/18, 11:03 PM - Alex Starr: There are worse dates
8/13/18, 11:03 PM - Alex Starr: Fates
8/13/18, 11:03 PM - Alex Starr: But also yes
8/13/18, 11:04 PM - Parker: like alex said people forget
8/13/18, 11:04 PM - Parker: that’s not a big deal anways haha
8/13/18, 11:04 PM - Alex Starr: It’s both liberating and terrible
8/13/18, 11:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: Do ittt
8/13/18, 11:30 PM - Darren: I endorse Jason's advice
8/17/18, 3:13 PM - Tim Ko: Alright guys
8/17/18, 3:14 PM - Tim Ko: So Jessica just requested to follow me back lol
8/17/18, 3:14 PM - Tim Ko: But I already unsent the dm I sent her on Monday
8/17/18, 3:14 PM - Tim Ko: So do I send another one?
8/17/18, 3:15 PM - Tim Ko: F me I shouldn’t have unsent it
8/17/18, 3:15 PM - Collin Hurst: why the fuck did you unsend
8/17/18, 3:15 PM - Collin Hurst: gdmi tim!
8/17/18, 3:15 PM - Collin Hurst: we said that was the worst idea of the week by far
8/17/18, 3:16 PM - Tim Ko: Yes I know haha
8/17/18, 3:16 PM - Tim Ko: I should have listened to y’all
8/17/18, 3:16 PM - Tim Ko: Idk I just figured she declined my message so there was no hope
8/17/18, 3:17 PM - Collin Hurst: dude I said 5 hours is literally nothing
8/17/18, 3:17 PM - Tim Ko: And yes collin it’s been 5 days
8/17/18, 3:17 PM - Tim Ko: So u were right
8/17/18, 3:17 PM - Tim Ko: With ur example
8/17/18, 3:17 PM - Collin Hurst: mhm
8/17/18, 3:17 PM - Collin Hurst: whatever whats done is done
8/17/18, 3:17 PM - Collin Hurst: accept the request, then wait a day or two and send a message
8/17/18, 3:18 PM - Collin Hurst: thats what I would do
8/17/18, 3:18 PM - Tim Ko: Aight that sounds good
8/17/18, 3:31 PM - Ricky: Noooo tim why?!!??
8/17/18, 3:31 PM - Ricky: It’s okie
8/17/18, 3:31 PM - Ricky: If at first you don’t succeed, slide slide again into them dms
8/17/18, 3:33 PM - Matt Casali: That's a creepy motto
8/17/18, 3:35 PM - Ricky: Why? Haha
8/17/18, 3:35 PM - Ricky: That’s what tinder is
8/17/18, 3:36 PM - Ricky: And how freddi dated you?
8/17/18, 3:37 PM - Matt Casali: One message: okay
8/17/18, 3:37 PM - Matt Casali: Two messages: pushing it
8/17/18, 3:37 PM - Matt Casali: Any more: why are you talking to a wall
8/17/18, 3:37 PM - Tim Ko: I feel like this is a one time thing for me haha
8/17/18, 3:42 PM - Ricky: ahah chiillll it was more of a joke jeeze
8/17/18, 3:42 PM - Ricky: i have never implemented said strat
8/17/18, 3:42 PM - Ricky: you do you timmy
8/17/18, 3:42 PM - Collin Hurst: once you have the confidence to slide into dms at your liking you'd be suprised tim
8/17/18, 3:43 PM - Collin Hurst: the internet has a plethora of prospects
8/17/18, 3:44 PM - Tim Ko: Ehh I feel like I’d only do it if I thought could potentially lead to something. Like prob wouldn’t dm anyone who doesn’t live in the bay
8/17/18, 3:45 PM - Tim Ko: In fact I decided not to try to talk to the girl from work partly cuz she’s from Michigan and I knew I’d probably never see her again
8/17/18, 3:46 PM - Matt Casali: Doesnt mean you cant get to know her haha
8/17/18, 3:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah distance always works out
8/17/18, 3:48 PM - Darren: True
8/17/18, 3:48 PM - Matt Casali: Not what I'm saying
8/17/18, 3:48 PM - Collin Hurst: True
8/17/18, 3:48 PM - Collin Hurst: True -Vaughn
8/17/18, 3:50 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah, it’s not like I intentionally ignored her, it’s that I would have to go way out of my way to talk to her so figured wasn’t worth it
8/17/18, 3:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: You probably crushed her but its all good
8/17/18, 3:50 PM - Vaughn: True
8/17/18, 3:51 PM - Tim Ko: What?
8/17/18, 3:51 PM - Ricky: ?
8/17/18, 3:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: I'm jk she just long gone is all
8/17/18, 4:04 PM - Parker: wtf??? damn it tim
8/17/18, 4:04 PM - Parker: it seems like you’re finding a way to get out of this even though u wanted to message her lol
8/17/18, 4:05 PM - Tim Ko: I unsent it cuz I didn’t wanna see the message on my side of the dms anymore
8/17/18, 4:06 PM - Collin Hurst: by deleting it it makes you seem so unconfident thats the thing
8/17/18, 4:07 PM - Tim Ko: Well that is true, I had no confidence
8/17/18, 4:07 PM - Tim Ko: I was very close to unfollowing her too haha
8/17/18, 4:07 PM - Collin Hurst: wow
8/17/18, 4:07 PM - Tim Ko: More cuz I wanted to forget about her
8/17/18, 4:08 PM - Collin Hurst: doesn't matter how unconfident you are tho it makes what you seem
8/17/18, 4:11 PM - Alex Starr: You had one job: to do nothing.
8/17/18, 4:11 PM - Alex Starr: You failed absolutely
8/17/18, 4:14 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
8/17/18, 4:16 PM - Parker: yeah u just needed to chill lol
8/17/18, 4:16 PM - Parker: it wasn’t a big deal at all
8/17/18, 4:16 PM - Parker: if anything she’d be more likely to tell the friends that u unsent it haha
8/17/18, 4:17 PM - Tim Ko: There are risks and costs to action. But they are far less than the long range risks of comfortable inaction. 
-John F. Kennedy
8/17/18, 4:17 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah oh well
8/17/18, 4:17 PM - Tim Ko: Parker if u ever meet her lmk ;)

8/17/18, 4:23 PM - Tim Ko: Gang
8/17/18, 4:36 PM - Alex Starr: It was uncomfortable inaction tho
8/17/18, 4:38 PM - Parker: ^
8/17/18, 4:59 PM - Tim Ko: Rip I think she just unfollowed me wtf lol
8/17/18, 4:59 PM - Tim Ko: Gdm I was just starting to forget about her
8/17/18, 5:00 PM - Tim Ko: *gdi
8/17/18, 5:00 PM - Tim Ko: I should just unfollow her
8/17/18, 5:04 PM - Collin Hurst: You still haven't even sent a second message man
8/17/18, 5:04 PM - Collin Hurst: You're trying to read her based on random shit just say what you want boi
8/17/18, 5:07 PM - Tim Ko: I don’t think I can anymore lol
8/17/18, 5:08 PM - Darren: Then just stop
8/17/18, 5:09 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah you can send her one
8/17/18, 5:09 PM - Collin Hurst: just do it
8/17/18, 5:15 PM - Tim Ko: Yup gonna take Darren’s advice on this
8/17/18, 5:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: Tim hayley says take the L
8/17/18, 5:32 PM - Tim Ko: Haha aight good call
8/17/18, 5:48 PM - Alex Starr: No one saw that coming
8/17/18, 5:50 PM - Alex Starr: I agree with darren and Jason but at this point it’s about principle
8/17/18, 5:50 PM - Alex Starr: You need to counter ur mistake of deleting ur message with the mistake of messaging her a second time
8/17/18, 5:51 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
8/17/18, 5:51 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
8/17/18, 5:52 PM - Alex Starr: Did u paint that or use a computer?
8/17/18, 5:52 PM - Matt Casali: Paint
8/17/18, 5:52 PM - Alex Starr: So you painted a second green version?
8/17/18, 5:52 PM - Collin Hurst: what do you want your message to be
8/17/18, 5:52 PM - Matt Casali: Idk
8/17/18, 5:53 PM - Alex Starr: If it’s “my dick is like a redwood” go with the green one
8/17/18, 5:53 PM - Matt Casali: Nah I think I'll just give her the green one
8/17/18, 5:53 PM - Matt Casali: Ayyy
8/17/18, 5:53 PM - Collin Hurst: i like the green on better just imo
8/17/18, 5:53 PM - Matt Casali: Jason you want the red one still?
8/17/18, 5:53 PM - Alex Starr: If it’s “my dick is like the tide (never stopping)” give her the beachy one
8/17/18, 6:11 PM - Ricky: wait, i love the green one
8/17/18, 6:11 PM - Ricky: if you dont give it to her

9/17/18, 12:27 AM - Tim Ko: I need an answer now
9/17/18, 12:27 AM - Vaughn: How often do you see her?
9/17/18, 12:28 AM - Tim Ko: Context: she came to my basketball game and we had a great time but I didn’t get a chance to ask to hang out after I walked her home. She just messaged me thanking me for inviting her and said “lmk if I want her support again”
9/17/18, 12:28 AM - Tim Ko: I don’t see her at all besides that
9/17/18, 12:28 AM - Vaughn: Youre in baby

9/17/18, 12:34 AM - Tim Ko: Not yet
9/17/18, 12:34 AM - Tim Ko: I’m kinda nervous
9/17/18, 12:34 AM - Vaughn: Dont second guess
9/17/18, 12:34 AM - Tim Ko: Maybe she just wanted to see my basketball game
9/17/18, 12:34 AM - Vaughn: She wants to see you again
9/17/18, 12:34 AM - Collin Hurst: ^
9/17/18, 12:34 AM - Collin Hurst: What was the exact text

9/18/18, 2:15 PM - Matt Casali: You feel it out tim
9/18/18, 2:15 PM - Vaughn: Go with the flow
9/18/18, 2:15 PM - Matt Casali: It's hard to give a set answer on that
9/18/18, 2:15 PM - Tim Ko: For sure
9/18/18, 2:15 PM - Matt Casali: My man
9/18/18, 2:15 PM - Tim Ko: But it can still be considered a date before then right?
9/18/18, 2:16 PM - Matt Casali: Yee
9/18/18, 2:16 PM - Vaughn: Step 1 for many is a date
9/18/18, 2:16 PM - Vaughn: Dtr later
9/18/18, 2:16 PM - Collin Hurst: ^
9/18/18, 2:16 PM - Tim Ko: For sure that’s what I thought. Do u mention the word date
9/18/18, 2:17 PM - Tim Ko: Or is it more like a feel thing
9/18/18, 2:17 PM - Vaughn: It shouldnt really be brought up
9/18/18, 2:17 PM - Tim Ko: Ok for sure
9/18/18, 2:17 PM - Vaughn: But if she asks if its a date then id say yes
9/18/18, 2:17 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah for sure! Haha
9/18/18, 2:18 PM - Tim Ko: Cuz I feel like this Thursday is a date but I never explicitly said it
9/18/18, 2:20 PM - Tim Ko: What are ur guy’s experience with first dates and how did they come about
9/18/18, 2:21 PM - Collin Hurst: It's a date but it's not you talk about it or anything
9/18/18, 2:22 PM - Collin Hurst: It's just like hanging out
9/18/18, 2:24 PM - Tim Ko: Ok for sure
9/18/18, 2:49 PM - Alex Starr: Best thing is probably not to think too much
9/18/18, 2:51 PM - Matt Casali: Switch that brain off boi
9/18/18, 2:52 PM - Tim Ko: Aight yeah
9/18/18, 3:00 PM - Alex Starr: Well no but don’t overthink
9/18/18, 3:00 PM - Alex Starr: Think exactly the proper amount
9/18/18, 3:01 PM - Alex Starr: It’s also on you to think through what the proper amount of thought is
9/18/18, 3:12 PM - Parker: yeah it’s a date
9/18/18, 3:12 PM - Parker: but jus the first one

9/18/18, 3:25 PM - Parker: her messages sounded like she was excited which is good
9/18/18, 3:25 PM - Alex Starr: But don’t underthink it either
9/18/18, 3:26 PM - Matt Casali: Dont think about snorting walrus'
9/18/18, 3:26 PM - Alex Starr: Well that might not be bad actually
9/18/18, 3:27 PM - Parker: i’d rather underthibk it than overthink it
9/18/18, 3:27 PM - Parker: but yeah
9/18/18, 3:27 PM - Matt Casali: I'd rather not worry about it at all
9/18/18, 3:29 PM - Parker: Yeah
9/18/18, 3:29 PM - Parker: but hard not to to so degree
9/18/18, 3:29 PM - Parker: some*

9/18/18, 5:00 PM - Parker: U just gotta pay for dinner and then have her pay for dessert tim
9/18/18, 5:00 PM - Parker: that’s key haha
9/18/18, 5:00 PM - Collin Hurst: ^
9/18/18, 5:11 PM - Tim Ko: Haha that’s what u did with Lauren huh collin
9/18/18, 5:11 PM - Tim Ko: Dang what a good idea lol
9/18/18, 5:14 PM - Collin Hurst: Well we paid for our own desserts and I paid for dinner lol
9/18/18, 5:14 PM - Vaughn: Ahhh shes sneaky
9/18/18, 5:14 PM - Alex Starr: I heard the ice cream was pissed about how much licking there was
9/18/18, 5:14 PM - Collin Hurst: But try to get dinner at a separate place so you can walk together and talk more
9/18/18, 5:15 PM - Tim Ko: For sure
9/18/18, 5:15 PM - Vaughn: Dont nagi ramen and sip some chocolate after
9/18/18, 5:16 PM - Vaughn: If you know what im sayin 😉
9/18/18, 5:17 PM - Tim Ko: I don’t know lol
9/18/18, 5:58 PM - Parker: and don’t plan dessert
9/18/18, 5:58 PM - Parker: make it spontaneous
9/18/18, 6:03 PM - Darren: Unless you're going to Ghirardelli
9/18/18, 6:07 PM - Parker: i did with tristyn too haha
9/18/18, 6:12 PM - Alex Starr: Guys this constitutes overthinking it
9/18/18, 6:12 PM - Darren: Ask her about baby names
9/18/18, 6:17 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
9/18/18, 6:27 PM - Parker: Nah it’s just a strat
9/18/18, 6:27 PM - Parker: you know it’s a good idea alex
9/18/18, 6:29 PM - Alex Starr: It doesn’t matter
9/18/18, 6:29 PM - Alex Starr: Need execution as well and if you focus on a strategy but don’t focus on execution
9/18/18, 6:34 PM - Tim Ko: I guess I’m kinda worried bout like what if she doesn’t think it’s a date
9/18/18, 6:47 PM - Collin Hurst: Doesn't matter
9/18/18, 6:48 PM - Collin Hurst: Lol don't think about it and she def does
9/18/18, 7:02 PM - Parker: yeah we’ll obviously don’t get dessert if it’s going poorly
9/18/18, 7:02 PM - Parker: yeah she definitely does tim lol
9/18/18, 7:05 PM - Matt Casali: Then you're having dinner with someone and you want to pay for them
9/18/18, 7:05 PM - Matt Casali: It's nbd man
9/18/18, 7:12 PM - Darren: She may think it's too forward and it'll make your interactions awkward for a couple weeks
9/18/18, 7:27 PM - Alex Starr: But seriously don’t worry about it
9/18/18, 7:27 PM - Alex Starr: This isn’t like an exam worrying doesn’t help you prepare
9/18/18, 7:32 PM - Darren: Unless the worrying ultimately forces you to make better choices for the date
9/18/18, 7:32 PM - Alex Starr: Well of course
9/18/18, 7:33 PM - Alex Starr: Or she isn’t right for you and the worrying leads to worse choices which is ultimately good
9/18/18, 7:39 PM - Alex Starr: But always remember, at the end of the day, there are literally tens of sporty tall Asian women who are willing to wait until marriage
9/18/18, 9:07 PM - Tim Ko: Aight yeah thx guys
9/18/18, 9:08 PM - Alex Starr: Lol we’ve been consummately unhelpful
9/18/18, 9:08 PM - Tim Ko: I was also really planning on joining that club she’s in so that might complicate things if it doesn’t work out lol
9/18/18, 9:08 PM - Tim Ko: Nah u guys have been great
9/18/18, 9:09 PM - Alex Starr: No it won’t

9/18/18, 9:09 PM - Tim Ko: Gang aight
9/18/18, 9:10 PM - Parker: Tim you should take her to asian karaoke
9/18/18, 9:10 PM - Parker: make sure to go up and sing too
9/18/18, 9:11 PM - Alex Starr: Maybe not that
9/18/18, 9:12 PM - Tim Ko: Oh that might scare her away lol
9/18/18, 9:12 PM - Tim Ko: Isn’t karaoke a group thing anyways
9/18/18, 9:12 PM - Alex Starr: I think you can safely ignore that suggestion for now
9/18/18, 9:13 PM - Vaughn: Just dont be as aggresive as you were at the table
9/18/18, 9:13 PM - Vaughn: Hit the ed sheehan
9/18/18, 9:54 PM - Parker: tristyn said it not me

9/18/18, 10:16 PM - Alex Starr: I stand by it
9/18/18, 10:17 PM - Vaughn: Bigger question
9/18/18, 10:17 PM - Vaughn: Can she be trysted?
9/18/18, 10:19 PM - Alex Starr: Not a quality follow up
9/18/18, 10:19 PM - Darren: Questionable
9/18/18, 10:20 PM - Alex Starr: A follow from grace to rival Lucifer’s
9/18/18, 10:20 PM - Alex Starr: Fall*
9/18/18, 10:20 PM - Alex Starr: Damn it autocorrect
9/18/18, 10:21 PM - Alex Starr: Just wanna say that trysting is actually a word
9/18/18, 10:57 PM - Parker: hahaha❤
9/18/18, 10:57 PM - Parker: no not really :/

9/18/18, 11:12 PM - Tim Ko: Ty!!
9/18/18, 11:12 PM - Tim Ko: What happenned?
9/18/18, 11:16 PM - Ricky: ^
9/18/18, 11:17 PM - Ricky: Usually not being confrontational is a good thing
9/18/18, 11:17 PM - Ricky: At least in my experience
9/18/18, 11:35 PM - Parker: not i. an aggressive way
9/18/18, 11:35 PM - Parker: just in the sense of bringing things up
9/18/18, 11:35 PM - Parker: when they need to be brought up
9/18/18, 11:35 PM - Parker: which sounds harsh and it’s not meant to be lol
9/19/18, 12:13 AM - Ricky: No I totally get that
9/19/18, 12:14 AM - Ricky: Sometimes I feel that way
9/19/18, 12:14 AM - Ricky: But you are you for a reason :)
9/19/18, 12:14 AM - Ricky: Just don’t let it build up, thats my advise. Does not usually go well
9/19/18, 12:35 AM - Tim Ko: If u don’t mind sharing, what’s the gist of the situation?
9/19/18, 1:04 AM - Parker: It was my first time hanging with T one on one since she’s been back and it was just kinda weird the whole time because we have stuff to talk about since it’s been 3 months but it’s just not in me to bring that up out of nowhere
9/19/18, 1:04 AM - Parker: We watched a movie which was fine but there was a weird/uncertain vibe
9/19/18, 1:07 AM - Parker: annoying more than anything
9/19/18, 1:09 AM - Ricky: dang im sorry bud
9/19/18, 1:10 AM - Ricky: sounds like ya gotta dig deep and talk about it if its bothering you
9/19/18, 1:29 AM - Collin Hurst: Yeah if it's bothering you a lot then it's best to speak your mind
9/19/18, 7:24 AM - Alex Starr: Or don’t

9/19/18, 8:26 AM - Tim Ko: Good that u txted her tho
9/19/18, 11:11 AM - Darren: You don't owe the tri-state area a thing
9/20/18, 1:59 PM - Alex Starr: Because tim pulled out of refereeing today to go out with Korean girl, the flag football games were cancelled haha
9/20/18, 2:04 PM - Matt Casali: Haha that's what I call romantic
9/20/18, 2:07 PM - Tim Ko: Omg 😂😂😂
9/20/18, 2:08 PM - Tim Ko: I thought there were 2 other refs that could work
9/20/18, 2:20 PM - Collin Hurst: Lmaoooo

9/20/18, 3:58 PM - Alex Starr: That’s 1 per game...
9/20/18, 4:25 PM - Tim Ko: That’s doable
9/20/18, 5:40 PM - Alex Starr: It’s not
9/20/18, 5:53 PM - Tim Ko: I did it for 3 games straight
9/20/18, 5:53 PM - Alex Starr: Doesn’t mean it was even remotely well done
9/20/18, 6:18 PM - Parker: Lol
9/20/18, 10:51 PM - Tim Ko: Date was great, spent like 3 HRs eating and talking lol

9/20/18, 10:51 PM - Vaughn: Yeeeee
9/20/18, 10:51 PM - Tim Ko: If we keep hanging out is it safe to assume she’s at least kinda interested in me? Lol
9/20/18, 10:52 PM - Tim Ko: Idk I’m just so caught up about this kinda stuff haha
9/20/18, 10:52 PM - Collin Hurst: did you secure the second date

9/20/18, 10:55 PM - Tim Ko: I mean she likes baseball in general
9/20/18, 10:55 PM - Tim Ko: Could it be just that?
9/20/18, 10:55 PM - Parker: Nah
9/20/18, 10:55 PM - Collin Hurst: No lol
9/20/18, 10:55 PM - Parker: i’d say she is
9/20/18, 10:55 PM - Parker: to some degree
9/20/18, 10:55 PM - Vaughn: Tim dont stress shes into you
9/20/18, 10:55 PM - Parker: ^

10/1/18, 11:57 PM - Tim Ko: Damn dude
10/1/18, 11:58 PM - Tim Ko: Do u think starting it over txt would be more comfortable for u?
10/1/18, 11:58 PM - Tim Ko: Idk if that’s a good idea or not tho lol
10/1/18, 11:59 PM - Parker: no not at all
10/1/18, 11:59 PM - Parker: maybe comfortable but not productive at all
10/1/18, 11:59 PM - Parker: been there done that

10/2/18, 1:31 AM - Ricky: also, collin seems like he wouldn't/very down to clown around at this stage in his life
10/2/18, 1:32 AM - Matt Casali: Yep that's what I'm thinking
10/2/18, 1:32 AM - Matt Casali: I do not think fwb works with men of our nature
10/2/18, 1:33 AM - Darren: Of our nature?
10/2/18, 1:34 AM - Matt Casali: Men like Collin and me
10/2/18, 1:34 AM - Matt Casali: And Ricky
10/2/18, 1:34 AM - Matt Casali: Idk about everyone else
10/2/18, 1:34 AM - Matt Casali: Just be careful, collin
10/2/18, 2:00 AM - Ricky: Lmao, I think it can work, lots of factors can come in to play
10/2/18, 2:00 AM - Ricky: Either way
10/2/18, 2:00 AM - Ricky: Gnight
10/2/18, 2:00 AM - Ricky: See You in 4 hours when I get up to study more

10/2/18, 6:43 AM - Ricky: True that brotha
10/2/18, 6:43 AM - Ricky: But Starbucks is my home for the time being lol
10/2/18, 8:40 AM - Collin Hurst: Yeah hopefully it goes ok
10/2/18, 9:33 AM - Tim Ko: Weren’t u and Donya kinda like that last year?
10/2/18, 9:34 AM - Alex Starr: I feel like collin could handle this kind of situation pretty well
10/2/18, 9:48 AM - Collin Hurst: I think im at pretty good about keeping my emotions in check
10/2/18, 9:48 AM - Vaughn: But she climbs...
10/2/18, 9:48 AM - Collin Hurst: Maybe too much
10/2/18, 9:48 AM - Collin Hurst: ^^^
10/2/18, 9:51 AM - Alex Starr: I agree
10/2/18, 9:54 AM - Jason Greenberg: Fuck her on some rocks mang
10/2/18, 9:54 AM - Jason Greenberg: You wont
10/2/18, 9:56 AM - Alex Starr: Lot of aggressiveness lately jason haha
10/2/18, 9:57 AM - Tim Ko: Oh man lol
10/2/18, 9:57 AM - Ricky: HAHAHA
10/2/18, 9:57 AM - Ricky: tim I think that advise was for you
10/2/18, 9:58 AM - Alex Starr: Who else would it be for?
10/2/18, 9:58 AM - Matt Casali: Hes in italy
10/2/18, 9:59 AM - Jason Greenberg: Honestly at the rate tim's relationship is progressing tim will be laying down some fresh tarmac soon if ya feel
10/2/18, 9:59 AM - Jason Greenberg: Alex you wanna fight
10/2/18, 9:59 AM - Alex Starr: The metaphors have been lackluster tho
10/2/18, 10:00 AM - Jason Greenberg: You don't agree?
10/2/18, 10:00 AM - Alex Starr: The sentiment yes the phrasing no
10/2/18, 10:01 AM - Jason Greenberg: Ah so this man is 3 days into this and already shacked up and you think laying tarmac is not appropriate?
10/2/18, 10:02 AM - Alex Starr: No
10/2/18, 10:02 AM - Alex Starr: It’s pretty vital things go quickly
10/2/18, 10:02 AM - Jason Greenberg: What would you say? Lowering the bumpers??
10/2/18, 10:02 AM - Alex Starr: He needs to make a water landing before the plane crashes
10/2/18, 10:03 AM - Alex Starr: Or at least tour the cockpit first
10/2/18, 10:05 AM - Jason Greenberg: A real splash down
10/2/18, 10:07 AM - Alex Starr: Even tho he’s an A fan he should definitely lead with splash down
10/2/18, 10:08 AM - Jason Greenberg: Non capisco
10/2/18, 10:10 AM - Alex Starr: No idea what that means haha
10/2/18, 10:16 AM - Parker: tim have u kissed her yet?
10/2/18, 10:21 AM - Matt Casali: Tim my unsolicited advice is to not consult with us for most major decisions. I appreciate that you value our advice enough to ask for it, but a lot of times it's just gonna be confusing and non helpful in this setting. I'd talk to friends in person or go with gut feelings about relationship stuff
10/2/18, 10:22 AM - Parker: that’s coming from someone with a lot of experience though matt
10/2/18, 10:23 AM - Matt Casali: But I didnt ask the groupchat in the beginning of my experiences
10/2/18, 10:24 AM - Collin Hurst: I think it's good to look for advice in situations such as texting a girl from Oregon
10/2/18, 10:26 AM - Matt Casali: Not from the groupchat though
10/2/18, 10:27 AM - Parker: we didn’t have it in 6th grade
10/2/18, 10:27 AM - Matt Casali: Eeeeggggggzactly
10/2/18, 10:28 AM - Collin Hurst: 3rd*
10/2/18, 10:28 AM - Vaughn: If asking us makes you more confident and comfortable with your decisions, id keep asking us
10/2/18, 10:28 AM - Parker: ^^
10/2/18, 10:28 AM - Vaughn: If we confuse you then i agree with matt
10/2/18, 10:29 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah the reason I said what I did is because he seems really confused
10/2/18, 10:29 AM - Matt Casali: But u right
10/2/18, 10:33 AM - Alex Starr: Always the possibility that he’d be even more confused minus ya
10/2/18, 10:33 AM - Alex Starr: Us
10/2/18, 10:36 AM - Matt Casali: Impossible
10/2/18, 10:42 AM - Jason Greenberg: Chill matt
10/2/18, 10:43 AM - Jason Greenberg: Tim's gonna figure it out
10/2/18, 10:43 AM - Alex Starr: Or he won’t
10/2/18, 10:43 AM - Alex Starr: He doesn’t owe whatshername a thing
10/2/18, 10:44 AM - Jason Greenberg: Anyway
10/2/18, 10:44 AM - Jason Greenberg: Just made bomb carbonara
10/2/18, 10:44 AM - Jason Greenberg: Does anyone know if it keeps in the fridge?
10/2/18, 10:44 AM - Alex Starr: I’d say wrong chat, but clearly the experience was such that it should be in this chat
10/2/18, 10:44 AM - Alex Starr: It should for a few days
10/2/18, 10:46 AM - Parker: or maybe he does
10/2/18, 10:47 AM - Alex Starr: Harsh
10/2/18, 11:22 AM - Darren: Nice

10/2/18, 11:30 AM - Tim Ko: I don’t wanna bother u guys too much tho
10/2/18, 11:30 AM - Matt Casali: No no no
10/2/18, 11:30 AM - Matt Casali: It doesnt bother us
10/2/18, 11:30 AM - Matt Casali: At least not me
10/2/18, 11:30 AM - Matt Casali: I just dont want you to be more confused than you already may be
10/2/18, 11:30 AM - Tim Ko: Ahh ok for sure
10/2/18, 11:31 AM - Tim Ko: I think now that we both established what we want (like a relationship) things are way more clear now
10/2/18, 11:32 AM - Jason Greenberg: Hot
10/2/18, 11:38 AM - Collin Hurst: I just jacked off to this

10/2/18, 3:10 PM - Ricky: I think talking is a good strategy tim!
10/2/18, 3:10 PM - Ricky: You don’t gotta kiss just cuz u dating now
10/2/18, 3:11 PM - Parker: Idk if kissing would be pushing any boundaries tho haha
10/2/18, 3:11 PM - Parker: hopefully not atleast
10/2/18, 3:13 PM - Ricky: It could be
10/2/18, 3:13 PM - Ricky: But more likely not
10/2/18, 3:13 PM - Ricky: Either way, you got it TIMMYYYYY

10/2/18, 3:33 PM - Parker: ^

10/2/18, 9:04 PM - Collin Hurst: Cute girl next door just texted me that she broke up with her bf

10/2/18, 9:09 PM - Collin Hurst: How so
10/2/18, 9:09 PM - Matt Casali: Cause either she wants to fuck or she needs someone to talk to
10/2/18, 9:09 PM - Collin Hurst: This is the sex and relationships chat
10/2/18, 9:09 PM - Darren: Matt, as an RA it might be your responsibility

10/3/18, 12:16 AM - Darren: How'd you respond?
10/3/18, 12:17 AM - Vaughn: If it means anything maya is 10x cuter than holly
10/3/18, 12:19 AM - Tim Ko: Lol
10/3/18, 12:20 AM - Darren: Something along the lines of "No, of course you're not. I think you're cute too, I'm just not sure what to do. You're at a very confusing place and I don't want to rush you through anything"
10/3/18, 12:20 AM - Vaughn: ^
10/3/18, 12:20 AM - Darren: Leaves things with potential to go somewhere, doesn't push for anything
10/3/18, 12:20 AM - Vaughn: She also has a single right next to his room
10/3/18, 12:21 AM - Darren: Add some hahas or or lols to make it less robotic
10/3/18, 12:21 AM - Darren: So many pros and cons
10/3/18, 12:22 AM - Darren: "No, of course you're not. If you think I'm cute, you should check out my friend Vaughn. Or this guy you matched with, matt"
10/3/18, 12:22 AM - Collin Hurst: I like this
10/3/18, 12:24 AM - Vaughn: If you dont close ot tonight collin ill swoop her before econ tomorrow
10/3/18, 12:27 AM - Collin Hurst: Econ is at 9am wtf haha

10/3/18, 12:36 AM - Parker: ill explain in like 10
10/3/18, 12:36 AM - Vaughn: When holly moved in collin literally said, "shes the prettriest girl ive seen on campus so far"
10/3/18, 12:36 AM - Darren: Uh oh
10/3/18, 12:36 AM - Vaughn: *maya
10/3/18, 12:36 AM - Vaughn: Sorry
10/3/18, 12:36 AM - Parker: no not an uh oh
10/3/18, 12:36 AM - Darren: Oh uh
10/3/18, 12:37 AM - Parker: but not completely good either
10/3/18, 12:37 AM - Parker: hahaha
10/3/18, 12:39 AM - Collin Hurst: Wow this convo has pivoted
10/3/18, 12:39 AM - Darren: In reference to with Maya, or with the Parker train chugging through
10/3/18, 12:39 AM - Collin Hurst: Maya
10/3/18, 12:45 AM - Collin Hurst: Oof
10/3/18, 12:45 AM - Parker: We left our friends walkers place and asked her if we could talk and she was like yeah and said she had put it off for awhile(no shit). It was awkward at first but we talked about shit from before study abroad and after. her expectations coming back from studying abroad was to just be friends but i guess the first week or so back up here she changed her mind that she possibly wanted something more than friends but now she’s stuck in the middle and genuinely doesn’t know
10/3/18, 12:46 AM - Parker: So lucky me, i got no concrete answer!!
10/3/18, 12:46 AM - Parker: hooray
10/3/18, 12:46 AM - Vaughn: To compare, the first thing you said about holly was "shes pretty nippy"
10/3/18, 12:46 AM - Darren: Fucking A
10/3/18, 12:46 AM - Darren: Sorry to hear that Parker
10/3/18, 12:47 AM - Vaughn: Damn bro
10/3/18, 12:47 AM - Collin Hurst: Well more concrete but just not tilted towards one side or the other
10/3/18, 12:47 AM - Collin Hurst: You're right
10/3/18, 12:47 AM - Vaughn: That sucks being stuck on her string
10/3/18, 12:48 AM - Matt Casali: All I gotta say is dont fucking toy with holly
10/3/18, 12:48 AM - Parker: no yeah it was definitely good to talk and it made me feel better but also like wtf
10/3/18, 12:48 AM - Parker: and she knows it’s not fair to me cuz i’m practically waiting for her
10/3/18, 12:48 AM - Vaughn: Too late matt shes literallt collins toy right now
10/3/18, 12:48 AM - Collin Hurst: I know man I feel bad about this whole situation right now cause Holly is really cool
10/3/18, 12:48 AM - Darren: Despite the jokes, she's not actually a child
10/3/18, 12:48 AM - Darren: Fwb tho
10/3/18, 12:49 AM - Parker: It made me feel good that she changed her mind since we’ve been back though haha
10/3/18, 12:49 AM - Parker: gives me hope
10/3/18, 12:49 AM - Vaughn: Does fwb mean you cant play with another girl?
10/3/18, 12:49 AM - Collin Hurst: Yeah but she's a good climbing friend, friend in general , we just happen to have sex also
10/3/18, 12:49 AM - Darren: It does not
10/3/18, 12:49 AM - Vaughn: Smells like a donya situation
10/3/18, 12:49 AM - Collin Hurst: That's not me
10/3/18, 12:49 AM - Darren: Wut
10/3/18, 12:49 AM - Collin Hurst: What
10/3/18, 12:50 AM - Darren: Don't make fun of her nose like that
10/3/18, 12:50 AM - Collin Hurst: What out for the h word
10/3/18, 12:50 AM - Vaughn: Rootin for you pman
10/3/18, 12:50 AM - Darren: _hope, in reality, is the worst of all evils for it prolongs the torments of man_
10/3/18, 12:50 AM - Parker: I’m well aware
10/3/18, 12:51 AM - Parker: idk i don’t feel much better but not worse so that’s a W i guess?
10/3/18, 12:51 AM - Collin Hurst: Vaughn don't fuck with me right now
10/3/18, 12:51 AM - Parker: she also went into detail and gave examples of how i’m too nice for her hahah
10/3/18, 12:51 AM - Vaughn: I meant to say maya
10/3/18, 12:51 AM - Parker: which i said was bullshit
10/3/18, 12:52 AM - Collin Hurst: I know but you got me thinking about it
10/3/18, 12:52 AM - Darren: That's a weird area
10/3/18, 12:52 AM - Parker: in what way
10/3/18, 12:52 AM - Vaughn: So you want me to say dont go for maya?
10/3/18, 12:52 AM - Vaughn: If so i think you know what you should do
10/3/18, 12:52 AM - Darren: "you're too nice for me" can be brought up for so many different reasons
10/3/18, 12:52 AM - Collin Hurst: Lowkey bs
10/3/18, 12:53 AM - Parker: high key bs
10/3/18, 12:53 AM - Parker: i told her that’s not a thing haha
10/3/18, 12:53 AM - Parker: which like i completely get what she’s saying but like idgaf
10/3/18, 12:53 AM - Parker: that’s just how i am
10/3/18, 12:53 AM - Collin Hurst: I'd ask her to make a decision and quit teasing your cock
10/3/18, 12:53 AM - Darren: Verbatim
10/3/18, 12:54 AM - Parker: Will do
10/3/18, 12:54 AM - Vaughn: WATO
10/3/18, 12:55 AM - Parker: i’m ok
10/3/18, 12:55 AM - Tim Ko: Ayyye I’m sorry to hear about that parker :((
10/3/18, 12:55 AM - Tim Ko: But kuddos to u for bringing it up and confronting her
10/3/18, 12:55 AM - Tim Ko: Takes a man with real balls dude
10/3/18, 12:56 AM - Matt Casali: What's the likelihood of you not defining the relationship but just spending the time that you can with her?
10/3/18, 12:56 AM - Tim Ko: It’s very unfair to u, but if u are willing to wait a couple more weeks, I’d do it
10/3/18, 12:56 AM - Parker: But the thing is idk how long it’ll be
10/3/18, 12:57 AM - Parker: so in a way the convo got nowhere
10/3/18, 12:57 AM - Parker: but atleast i know where she stands
10/3/18, 12:57 AM - Parker: that’s what i’ll do as much as i can haha
10/3/18, 12:57 AM - Tim Ko: Is the whole thing stressing u out a bit?
10/3/18, 12:58 AM - Matt Casali: Noice
10/3/18, 12:58 AM - Tim Ko: Also this is very savage and I agree hahahah
10/3/18, 12:59 AM - Matt Casali: Emotionally probably not
10/3/18, 12:59 AM - Matt Casali: Js
10/3/18, 1:00 AM - Tim Ko: If I were in Parker’s situation, I’d be very emotionally stressed
10/3/18, 1:00 AM - Parker: Yes and no
10/3/18, 1:00 AM - Matt Casali: I was talking about Holly vs. Maya
10/3/18, 1:00 AM - Tim Ko: Oh lol
10/3/18, 1:00 AM - Matt Casali: Maya also isn't that cute
10/3/18, 1:00 AM - Matt Casali: Besides the point
10/3/18, 1:01 AM - Parker: also it’s kinda fucked up though(and she admitted this) because she spent the night last saturday and monday at my house
10/3/18, 1:01 AM - Collin Hurst: She's not your type and that's ok matt
10/3/18, 1:01 AM - Matt Casali: Okey
10/3/18, 1:01 AM - Collin Hurst: Cute enough to match on tinder 🤫
10/3/18, 1:01 AM - Tim Ko: Like slept over in ur room
10/3/18, 1:01 AM - Darren: Primetime fight
10/3/18, 1:01 AM - Tim Ko: Lol
10/3/18, 1:01 AM - Collin Hurst: Tf
10/3/18, 1:02 AM - Matt Casali: D00d
10/3/18, 1:02 AM - Matt Casali: Omg
10/3/18, 1:02 AM - Tim Ko: Parker u gotta send her the men
10/3/18, 1:02 AM - Tim Ko: Meme
10/3/18, 1:02 AM - Darren: Send her the men Parker
10/3/18, 1:02 AM - Tim Ko: 😂😂
10/3/18, 1:02 AM - Matt Casali: Hahaha
10/3/18, 1:02 AM - Matt Casali: Parker
10/3/18, 1:02 AM - Matt Casali: Plz
10/3/18, 1:02 AM - Parker: i appreciated your last two messages darren hahaha
10/3/18, 1:02 AM - Matt Casali: For ur sake and mine
10/3/18, 1:02 AM - Tim Ko: As soon as I sent that I was like oh shit
10/3/18, 1:02 AM - Collin Hurst: Talking about Holly or Maya
10/3/18, 1:02 AM - Parker: i want you to know that
10/3/18, 1:03 AM - Parker: No tim i made her sleep in the laundry room
10/3/18, 1:03 AM - Matt Casali: Dont worry about it and let your relationship unfold
10/3/18, 1:03 AM - Tim Ko: Honestly parker I think it comes down to how much ur willing to put up with and what u want.
10/3/18, 1:03 AM - Matt Casali: The stress you're feeling may be coming from your effort to control something that's amazingly difficult to control
10/3/18, 1:03 AM - Vaughn: For real though collin be careful, maya breaks your golden rule of getting with a floormate. Not only that but shes tight friends with everyone else on your floor through that community buddy system thing
10/3/18, 1:03 AM - Collin Hurst: Matt who are you talking to
10/3/18, 1:03 AM - Parker: Matt in not worried about it it’s just like i want an answer
10/3/18, 1:03 AM - Matt Casali: And it could be what's making both of you confused
10/3/18, 1:04 AM - Matt Casali: Both of you, all of you
10/3/18, 1:04 AM - Parker: No i’m not stressed about it or am far less than 3 hours ago
10/3/18, 1:04 AM - Tim Ko: And u deserve one soon
10/3/18, 1:04 AM - Matt Casali: I'll talk to you about this tomorrow Collin
10/3/18, 1:04 AM - Matt Casali: We for straightening out to do sie
10/3/18, 1:04 AM - Vaughn: Can we get an update on the convo or is it over?
10/3/18, 1:04 AM - Collin Hurst: It's not my rule, just the rule that everyone  in the office mentioned and Maya herself too lol
10/3/18, 1:04 AM - Matt Casali: *Sir
10/3/18, 1:05 AM - Collin Hurst: Convo over goodnights have been said

10/3/18, 1:05 AM - Matt Casali: Y tho. Like w/o putting a good/bad label on why you might want it, why do you want it?
10/3/18, 1:06 AM - Parker: Because i genuinely like her
10/3/18, 1:06 AM - Parker: what do u mean
10/3/18, 1:06 AM - Vaughn: Parkers been blueballed this whole time, no doubt he wants some closure
10/3/18, 1:06 AM - Collin Hurst: Tell her that she should choose cause you're getting hurt from her not doing so
10/3/18, 1:06 AM - Matt Casali: If he wants sex, he should ask for sex and be done with her
10/3/18, 1:06 AM - Collin Hurst: Fuck and chuck
10/3/18, 1:06 AM - Matt Casali: Y u getting hurt tho
10/3/18, 1:06 AM - Darren: Just ask for sex
10/3/18, 1:07 AM - Darren: Is that how this works
10/3/18, 1:07 AM - Vaughn: Chillllll
10/3/18, 1:07 AM - Parker: that’s not all i want
10/3/18, 1:07 AM - Matt Casali: What do u want
10/3/18, 1:07 AM - Parker: matt idk who you’re talking to lol
10/3/18, 1:07 AM - Matt Casali: Sex and a side dish?
10/3/18, 1:07 AM - Parker: like this whole convo
10/3/18, 1:07 AM - Parker: I want to date her
10/3/18, 1:07 AM - Vaughn: Hes wanted the same thing this for the past year boyo
10/3/18, 1:07 AM - Darren: He's talking to you Parker
10/3/18, 1:07 AM - Parker: and that’s what we talked about
10/3/18, 1:07 AM - Parker: we didn’t talk about sex
10/3/18, 1:07 AM - Matt Casali: Then go with her on dates my man
10/3/18, 1:07 AM - Parker: ^
10/3/18, 1:08 AM - Collin Hurst: Fuck her once,then she's a dance

10/3/18, 1:08 AM - Parker: stfu collin
10/3/18, 1:08 AM - Vaughn: Dont start this collin
10/3/18, 1:08 AM - Darren: Ah, the Holly approach
10/3/18, 1:08 AM - Matt Casali: I dont understand why that needs to be explicitly stated
10/3/18, 1:08 AM - Matt Casali: This I mean
10/3/18, 1:08 AM - Vaughn: More like fuck her thrice with a side of jasmine rice
10/3/18, 1:08 AM - Collin Hurst: I am genuinely afraid about what is going to happen
10/3/18, 1:08 AM - Parker: Because you asked hahaha
10/3/18, 1:09 AM - Parker: i don’t think it needs to be
10/3/18, 1:09 AM - Matt Casali: You have good reason, collin
10/3/18, 1:09 AM - Matt Casali: I told Holly the same thing
10/3/18, 1:09 AM - Matt Casali: If you guys asked me two weeks ago I would have told you that sex is ill advised
10/3/18, 1:09 AM - Vaughn: At least you dont live bext to her
10/3/18, 1:09 AM - Matt Casali: But Holly is my friend
10/3/18, 1:10 AM - Matt Casali: Plz take that into account
10/3/18, 1:10 AM - Matt Casali: Cause I feel like you're not
10/3/18, 1:10 AM - Darren: "so was I" - collin
10/3/18, 1:10 AM - Vaughn: Hahahaah
10/3/18, 1:10 AM - Collin Hurst: How so
10/3/18, 1:10 AM - Collin Hurst: I haven't committed to anything as of now
10/3/18, 1:10 AM - Tim Ko: Parker do u see urself wanting to date her long term
10/3/18, 1:10 AM - Tim Ko: Like even after she graduates
10/3/18, 1:10 AM - Vaughn: Sorry holly, gotta pull out cause matts my friend
10/3/18, 1:10 AM - Matt Casali: Comparisons of her and maya seem to dehumanize her
10/3/18, 1:11 AM - Vaughn: Matts your friend
10/3/18, 1:11 AM - Matt Casali: And I dont want that to happen to my friend
10/3/18, 1:11 AM - Collin Hurst: I wasn't the one bringing up nips and shit
10/3/18, 1:11 AM - Parker: that’s was another thing she brought up
10/3/18, 1:11 AM - Collin Hurst: I do actually like her as a friend
10/3/18, 1:11 AM - Collin Hurst: And I would like to keep that going
10/3/18, 1:11 AM - Parker: idk that’s far down the road
10/3/18, 1:11 AM - Matt Casali: That's good to hear
10/3/18, 1:11 AM - Parker: not that far but far enough
10/3/18, 1:12 AM - Vaughn: Ill take the blame for dehumanizing, i dont know either of them well enough
10/3/18, 1:11 AM - Matt Casali: Like actually
10/3/18, 1:12 AM - Tim Ko: I see
10/3/18, 1:12 AM - Collin Hurst: I just don't really know how to exit and keep decent friendship status
10/3/18, 1:12 AM - Darren: How dare you, Vaughn
10/3/18, 1:12 AM - Collin Hurst: And then make it seem like it wasn't for Maya cause it will be honestly
10/3/18, 1:13 AM - Matt Casali: Do what I did with Keegan: just dont have sex if you dont want t do that
10/3/18, 1:13 AM - Collin Hurst: We did talk about the fact that it would be ok for things to end like "I like this one person now so this has to stop"
10/3/18, 1:13 AM - Matt Casali: And if you do, then you do it (with consent)
10/3/18, 1:13 AM - Collin Hurst: It's just so much easier than I thought
10/3/18, 1:13 AM - Collin Hurst: Earlier*
10/3/18, 1:13 AM - Tim Ko: Parker I’d say if ur ok with where ur at, just wait on her, but if u really want an answer, set like a timeline for urself
10/3/18, 1:13 AM - Vaughn: AHA i knew you and keegan were a thing
10/3/18, 1:13 AM - Matt Casali: Everyone was cool with this?
10/3/18, 1:13 AM - Tim Ko: Maybe like an answer in a couple weeks or something
10/3/18, 1:14 AM - Matt Casali: "Thing"?
10/3/18, 1:14 AM - Collin Hurst: I said that and she said yeah, but it seems so early
10/3/18, 1:14 AM - Darren: Don't fucking throw in labels, vaughn
10/3/18, 1:14 AM - Matt Casali: Honestly tho
10/3/18, 1:15 AM - Matt Casali: Seems so early to think of an exit plan? Yes I agree
10/3/18, 1:15 AM - Parker: yeah but i just don’t know when something will change
10/3/18, 1:15 AM - Parker: that’s the problem
10/3/18, 1:15 AM - Collin Hurst: I'm thinking that I should talk to her about not having sex anymore cause I value her as a friend and want to keep that
10/3/18, 1:15 AM - Matt Casali: Wheres that gwtf mentality friends?
10/3/18, 1:15 AM - Vaughn: Good idea
10/3/18, 1:15 AM - Collin Hurst: That would be a good way to end the fwb status
10/3/18, 1:15 AM - Matt Casali: Everything is so god damn planned out jesus christ
10/3/18, 1:15 AM - Darren: Matt is so righteous right now
10/3/18, 1:15 AM - Vaughn: Collin has been the gwtf masta matt
10/3/18, 1:15 AM - Matt Casali: I'm always righteous
10/3/18, 1:16 AM - Collin Hurst: Maya has the gwtf apparently
10/3/18, 1:16 AM - Collin Hurst: I hate gwtf
10/3/18, 1:16 AM - Matt Casali: I dont believe your words
10/3/18, 1:16 AM - Collin Hurst: But am forced into it sometimes
10/3/18, 1:16 AM - Darren: Yeah...we know
10/3/18, 1:16 AM - Vaughn: You say it like its a disease
10/3/18, 1:17 AM - Matt Casali: Well you said right now, like I wasnt always
10/3/18, 1:17 AM - Tim Ko: I see, yeah in that case maybe set boundaries for urself, like let’s say in a month if nothings change, I hate to say it but maybe move on
10/3/18, 1:17 AM - Darren: Emphasis on _so_
10/3/18, 1:17 AM - Matt Casali: Oh okey
10/3/18, 1:17 AM - Matt Casali: Well
10/3/18, 1:17 AM - Matt Casali: Collin I would very much like to talk about this tomorrow
10/3/18, 1:18 AM - Collin Hurst: Sorry I have class
10/3/18, 1:18 AM - Matt Casali: You do not have class all fucking day you loser
10/3/18, 1:18 AM - Vaughn: I'll i hear is that mayas mine by the time econ rolls by
10/3/18, 1:18 AM - Vaughn: Swoop
10/3/18, 1:18 AM - Collin Hurst: I have at least one class
10/3/18, 1:18 AM - Vaughn: Scoopitypoop
10/3/18, 1:19 AM - Darren: Bad
10/3/18, 1:19 AM - Matt Casali: We can talk about it during times in which you dont have class
10/3/18, 1:19 AM - Collin Hurst: Sure
10/3/18, 1:19 AM - Matt Casali: Cool
10/3/18, 1:19 AM - Collin Hurst: 11:00?
10/3/18, 1:19 AM - Matt Casali: I want to know more about your thought process
10/3/18, 1:19 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah that's good
10/3/18, 1:19 AM - Collin Hurst: Ok it's a date
10/3/18, 1:19 AM - Collin Hurst: Goodnight peeps

10/3/18, 1:23 AM - Tim Ko: Good y’all boys
10/3/18, 1:23 AM - Tim Ko: *talk
10/3/18, 1:23 AM - Tim Ko: One day we’ll all be in our retirement home and remember this day
10/3/18, 1:39 AM - Parker: night!
10/3/18, 1:40 AM - Jason Greenberg: Jesus dip your dick coll
10/3/18, 1:41 AM - Jason Greenberg: Goodluck with ya girl pman
10/3/18, 7:12 AM - Alex Starr: ^
10/3/18, 7:13 AM - Alex Starr: My main takeaway here is that collin has insane game
10/3/18, 7:14 AM - Alex Starr: But that for some reason some people want him not to use it
10/3/18, 7:16 AM - Jason Greenberg: They jelly
10/3/18, 7:17 AM - Alex Starr: Right?
10/3/18, 9:05 AM - Collin Hurst: Maya has dark hair but piercing blue eyes it's crazy
10/3/18, 9:06 AM - Vaughn: Haha you get a good night sleep?
10/3/18, 9:10 AM - Collin Hurst: Yee
10/3/18, 9:10 AM - Collin Hurst: Let's go to class
10/3/18, 9:14 AM - Alex Starr: I’m surprised collin isn’t spamming pics pics
10/3/18, 9:21 AM - Collin Hurst: You want ?
10/3/18, 9:26 AM - Matt Casali: Like Zooey Deschanel
10/3/18, 9:28 AM - Parker: OOOOF
10/3/18, 9:32 AM - Alex Starr: Sure
10/3/18, 9:32 AM - Parker: i do
10/3/18, 9:35 AM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
10/3/18, 9:41 AM - Tim Ko: Looks a little like shira
10/3/18, 9:41 AM - Alex Starr: I have no idea who shira is, but was pretty sure you’d say that
10/3/18, 9:45 AM - Parker: it all comes full circle back to shira
10/3/18, 9:45 AM - Jason Greenberg: Coll your adams apple is way bigger than that guys  i dont know if she can handle that
10/3/18, 9:45 AM - Collin Hurst: That was her brother lol
10/3/18, 9:45 AM - Jason Greenberg: Oh shit hahaha
10/3/18, 9:46 AM - Parker: Lol
10/3/18, 9:51 AM - Collin Hurst: Thanks for the support tho
10/3/18, 10:16 AM - Tim Ko: Lolol
10/3/18, 1:18 PM - Ricky: Hahaha
10/3/18, 1:18 PM - Ricky: God DAMN, this convo was exciting as shit
10/3/18, 1:19 PM - Vaughn: It was weaving in and out, some plot twists
10/3/18, 1:19 PM - Ricky: Pman, you deserve the best my friend, I’m so confused with what you should do with trystin, like she obviously cares for you it just seems like she is scared to commit
10/3/18, 1:21 PM - Ricky: Matt I’m kinda confused by your aggression toward Collin and holly, maybe I’m lacking context, but I don’t get why they can’t be fwb? Like, that isn’t an inherently bad relationship to have with someone. I think it’s smart to plan ahead if you are worried about the future. But once again, I may be missing something
10/3/18, 1:21 PM - Ricky: Either way. This was a good read
10/3/18, 1:22 PM - Collin Hurst: He thought that I was kind of just treating her a sex thing and he felt weird about that cause she is his good friend
10/3/18, 1:22 PM - Collin Hurst: But I think of her as a good friend to and want to keep that intact so that's why I'm gonna stop being fwb
10/3/18, 1:26 PM - Ricky: Ohhhh gotcha
10/3/18, 1:27 PM - Ricky: Well, once again, I don’t think you can’t be fwb, but if it’s weird that good idea
10/3/18, 1:28 PM - Collin Hurst: Also it's just a better way to end it than saying I'm interested in someone else
10/3/18, 1:28 PM - Collin Hurst: Cause that's part of it
10/3/18, 1:28 PM - Ricky: Also, she could have been using you as a sex thing!!!!!!
10/3/18, 1:28 PM - Collin Hurst: Lol maybe
10/3/18, 1:28 PM - Ricky: Matt just assuming the guy is sexually simplifying things, smh
10/3/18, 1:29 PM - Collin Hurst: We talked about how sad it would be if we lost our friendship cause we stopped having sex
10/3/18, 1:29 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah smh
10/3/18, 1:29 PM - Jason Greenberg: Fucking tru
10/3/18, 1:29 PM - Collin Hurst: But the convo with Maya last night got spicy lol
10/3/18, 1:30 PM - Collin Hurst: She's so damn direct
10/3/18, 1:31 PM - Parker: YeH i think that’s most of it for a variety of reasons. she just really emphasized how she isn’t great in relationships and thinks i would put more time and effort into it than she would just based on how we are as people, but i feel like some relationships are just like that
10/3/18, 1:32 PM - Parker: She also said she is scared that she might hurt me one day if things don’t work out but i said you don’t go into any relationship wanting to hurt the other person
10/3/18, 1:32 PM - Parker: i also emphasized that we haven’t changed much since we became close friends and i liked her for a reason and i wouldn’t have waited this out if i didn’t want it
10/3/18, 1:35 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah I think you just need to get her to make a decision at this point
10/3/18, 1:42 PM - Parker: But she hasn’t and i can’t force that
10/3/18, 1:43 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah that's true, I would just make it known that it really sucks for you if you're in limbo
10/3/18, 1:56 PM - Parker: She knows that
10/3/18, 1:56 PM - Parker: she said she felt bad because i’m essentially just waiting on her
10/3/18, 1:57 PM - Parker: Idk she has a lot of shit going on and has also had a shitty, stressful week so that factors into it
10/3/18, 2:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: She sounds non bene per you
10/3/18, 2:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: Bc if she's right about herself, then obviously thats bad. If she's just saying that as a way to be noncommital (its me not you kinda speech) then thats not good either
10/3/18, 2:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: You're a young stud plenty going on, and you deserve someone who want you like Maya wants Collins adams apple in her va j-j
10/3/18, 2:15 PM - Collin Hurst: What's with he Adams apple lol
10/3/18, 2:18 PM - Vaughn: Its your defining feature now that the moles gone
10/3/18, 2:19 PM - Collin Hurst: Lol
10/3/18, 2:19 PM - Collin Hurst: I would think eyebrows but I'll take it
10/3/18, 2:20 PM - Parker: what does that mean
10/3/18, 2:20 PM - Darren: Abs
10/3/18, 2:21 PM - Parker: I would say she’s right but what i’m trying to say is i’ve known how and who she is this whole time and like her, not necessarily because of that, but it hasn’t changed my mind
10/3/18, 2:21 PM - Parker: abs or eyebrows for sure
10/3/18, 2:24 PM - Alex Starr: That doesn’t change the truth of what jason is saying I think
10/3/18, 2:28 PM - Parker: it sounded like they were insecurities more than anything
10/3/18, 2:28 PM - Parker: which i told her it’s not like a bad thing
10/3/18, 2:29 PM - Alex Starr: I think at this point that there isn’t much reason to think she will suddenly be ready to jump in
10/3/18, 2:33 PM - Parker: i don’t think she willl be either
10/3/18, 2:33 PM - Parker: not suddenly atleast
10/3/18, 2:33 PM - Darren: Did you consider giving her the old "you talk too much" -> make out session in the pouring rain
10/3/18, 2:33 PM - Alex Starr: Question is then how long are you willing to wait
10/3/18, 2:33 PM - Alex Starr: So basically the notebook?
10/3/18, 2:34 PM - Darren: Probably?
10/3/18, 2:34 PM - Parker: I gotta wait a couple weeks for that, it’s not rainy yet
10/3/18, 2:34 PM - Parker: soon though
10/3/18, 2:37 PM - Matt Casali: Not at all jeez
10/3/18, 2:39 PM - Alex Starr: That was the impression I got
10/3/18, 2:39 PM - Matt Casali: Well
10/3/18, 2:40 PM - Alex Starr: Comparisons of her and maya seem to dehumanize her
10/3/18, 2:41 PM - Alex Starr: This especially
10/3/18, 2:44 PM - Parker: i got it now you italian fuck
10/3/18, 2:44 PM - Alex Starr: What tipped you off?
10/3/18, 2:46 PM - Parker: Haha i just realized that it wasn’t english
10/3/18, 2:46 PM - Parker: i thought it was a typo or something
10/3/18, 3:49 PM - Tim Ko: Have u ever thought of karli parker? Lolol
10/3/18, 3:54 PM - Matt Casali: Karli is dope af
10/3/18, 4:09 PM - Parker: Hahah not in that way
10/3/18, 4:09 PM - Parker: we’re really good friends and i love her to death but not my type
10/3/18, 4:09 PM - Parker: facts
10/3/18, 4:39 PM - Parker: that also makes it sound like i’m picking from a lineup or something lol
10/3/18, 4:45 PM - Darren: Have any other female friends you can use like you're mining resources?
10/3/18, 4:47 PM - Ricky: Hahah
10/3/18, 4:48 PM - Parker: 😂
10/3/18, 5:08 PM - Tim Ko: I see haha
10/3/18, 11:12 PM - Darren: I sent Christine an equivalent of a post mortem tonight explaining how grateful I am she was in my life and how I'm happy she broke up with me because it means she can be happier - just all the stuff I didn't say to her before that I felt like needed to be said
10/3/18, 11:13 PM - Darren: I spent like 30 minutes in the library crying while write ng it, shit's hard yo
10/3/18, 11:13 PM - Darren: [No Action Required for this message]
10/3/18, 11:18 PM - Parker: Aww❤❤
10/3/18, 11:21 PM - Tim Ko: Dude 😍😍😍
10/3/18, 11:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: Wow
10/3/18, 11:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: Did it give you more peace
10/3/18, 11:44 PM - Darren: I don't know
10/3/18, 11:45 PM - Darren: Tho idk is an answer that would implicitly say no, I guess
10/3/18, 11:46 PM - Ricky: Damn
10/3/18, 11:46 PM - Collin Hurst: Glad you could get some closure
10/3/18, 11:46 PM - Ricky: That is the real stuff
10/3/18, 11:46 PM - Collin Hurst: You're you're all good man
10/3/18, 11:50 PM - Parker: How’s Julia tim
10/3/18, 11:54 PM - Ricky: I know this is weird but sometimes I chase the feeling I get when I do things like that Darren
10/3/18, 11:54 PM - Ricky: I’m not sure how u felt, but feeling such an extreme level of emotions is something I sometimes just want to get to
10/3/18, 11:57 PM - Darren: I understand what you're saying and it is very novel, but I also don't particularly enjoy spontaneously breaking down while shaving
10/3/18, 11:58 PM - Tim Ko: I think it’s good that u were able to let ur emotions out :)
10/3/18, 11:59 PM - Tim Ko: She’s good haha, haven’t seen her since we dtr but been txting and snap chatting her
10/3/18, 11:59 PM - Ricky: Gotcha, honestly, I’m not sure if I like it, but kinda gravitate toward it sometimes
10/4/18, 12:00 AM - Tim Ko: Gonna get boba with her this Friday, I think I’m gonna go for the handhold 😅😅
10/4/18, 12:00 AM - Ricky: If ya need anything, you know who to reach out to
10/4/18, 12:00 AM - Ricky: Gonfor it Timmy! Also, you should be her study buddy ;)))
10/4/18, 12:01 AM - Jason Greenberg: Wait you shave?
10/4/18, 12:04 AM - Darren: Not really, I'm still doing the beard, but the neck part of the beard gets shaved
10/4/18, 12:07 AM - Tim Ko: I like the beard
10/4/18, 12:08 AM - Tim Ko: Ooo yeah maybe, tho I don’t think she studies that much lolol
10/4/18, 12:09 AM - Tim Ko: Or studies at like 2 am
10/4/18, 12:10 AM - Matt Casali: Healthy and cool 👍
10/4/18, 12:10 AM - Darren: Thanks Tim, it's part of my single life victory tour. I had relationship issues every time I had a beard, so now that I got no relationship, I can grow a beard in peace
10/4/18, 12:12 AM - Tim Ko: Mmmm for sure man!!
10/4/18, 12:13 AM - Darren: That's a deal breaker
10/4/18, 12:13 AM - Tim Ko: Lol
10/4/18, 12:13 AM - Tim Ko: I sent her the meme of the mixed signal generator 😂😂
10/4/18, 12:13 AM - Darren: You really like that one, Tim
10/4/18, 12:13 AM - Tim Ko: But I made it clear that I did not think of her in that way haha
10/4/18, 12:13 AM - Tim Ko: Yes I rlly do
10/4/18, 12:14 AM - Tim Ko: It’s such a great descriptor

10/4/18, 12:22 AM - Tim Ko: Aye gang gang
10/4/18, 12:22 AM - Tim Ko: Are u trying to pursue something with her
10/4/18, 12:22 AM - Tim Ko: I’m sure it was “YouTube” 😅
10/4/18, 12:23 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah and not "pornhub" 😅
10/4/18, 12:24 AM - Collin Hurst: She just sent me this lol
10/4/18, 12:24 AM - Darren: An hour on pornhub would be impressive
10/4/18, 12:24 AM - Tim Ko: Lol
10/4/18, 12:24 AM - Tim Ko: Wait and she lives right next to u?
10/4/18, 12:24 AM - Tim Ko: This is kinda funny haha
10/4/18, 12:24 AM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
10/4/18, 12:25 AM - Collin Hurst: she just sent that
10/4/18, 12:25 AM - Tim Ko: Oh wtf
10/4/18, 12:25 AM - Tim Ko: Bruh
10/4/18, 12:25 AM - Tim Ko: Send the meme
10/4/18, 12:25 AM - Collin Hurst: yeah one door down across the hall
10/4/18, 12:25 AM - Collin Hurst: lmao I really want to
10/4/18, 12:25 AM - Tim Ko: Do it
10/4/18, 12:25 AM - Tim Ko: No regrets
10/4/18, 12:26 AM - Tim Ko: This is why I love the meme
10/4/18, 12:26 AM - Tim Ko: It’s just so true
10/4/18, 12:26 AM - Tim Ko: I’ll send it for u
10/4/18, 12:26 AM - Tim Ko: 😂
10/4/18, 12:26 AM - Tim Ko: What’s her last name
10/4/18, 12:27 AM - Collin Hurst: no tim do not send her anything
10/4/18, 12:27 AM - Collin Hurst: jesus
10/4/18, 12:27 AM - Ricky: Hahahahaha
10/4/18, 12:27 AM - Parker: fuck off tim
10/4/18, 12:27 AM - Tim Ko: Lol
10/4/18, 12:27 AM - Ricky: That would be funny
10/4/18, 12:27 AM - Ricky: But not worth
10/4/18, 12:29 AM - Matt Casali: Honestly really dont like that meme
10/4/18, 12:29 AM - Ricky: Haha why?
10/4/18, 12:29 AM - Matt Casali: Shes understandably confused because she got out of a longterm relationship
10/4/18, 12:30 AM - Matt Casali: She wanted comfort but went too far with what she thought she wanted
10/4/18, 12:30 AM - Matt Casali: It makes it seem like its purposeful on their part, when it's most definitely not
10/4/18, 12:30 AM - Collin Hurst: nevertheless she is still sending mixed signals
10/4/18, 12:30 AM - Ricky: Which is confusing from another perspective
10/4/18, 12:31 AM - Matt Casali: Well no doubt
10/4/18, 12:31 AM - Tim Ko: Not saying it’s purposeful
10/4/18, 12:31 AM - Matt Casali: But it's the fault of both parties
10/4/18, 12:31 AM - Matt Casali: Not just one
10/4/18, 12:31 AM - Ricky: It’s a meme matt
10/4/18, 12:31 AM - Collin Hurst: regardless if they have reasons behind them or not lol
10/4/18, 12:31 AM - Tim Ko: But it’s still mixed signals
10/4/18, 12:31 AM - Ricky: 90% are without meaning besides to heem someone
10/4/18, 12:31 AM - Parker: ^
10/4/18, 12:31 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah^^
10/4/18, 12:31 AM - Tim Ko: It’s satiricle
10/4/18, 12:31 AM - Matt Casali: Damn I was doing so good at not participating in the chat haha
10/4/18, 12:32 AM - Matt Casali: I don't think its satirical but ok
10/4/18, 12:32 AM - Parker: fu k idk what to do
10/4/18, 12:32 AM - Parker: everyone here agrees that’s it’s unfair to me what tristyn is doing
10/4/18, 12:32 AM - Parker: which i agree with
10/4/18, 12:33 AM - Tim Ko: Is it on ur mind a lot?
10/4/18, 12:33 AM - Tim Ko: Cuz it seems like it
10/4/18, 12:34 AM - Tim Ko: And honestly if it’s causing u that much stress I don’t think it’s worth it
10/4/18, 12:34 AM - Ricky: I honestly think it is
10/4/18, 12:34 AM - Ricky: Haha
10/4/18, 12:34 AM - Ricky: But not from the stress side
10/4/18, 12:34 AM - Ricky: From the optimistic potential of what is to come side
10/4/18, 12:34 AM - Tim Ko: Oh ok well u prob no more about situation than I do
10/4/18, 12:35 AM - Tim Ko: But it seems like parker u have been waiting for months now
10/4/18, 12:35 AM - Ricky: Haha sorry that wasn’t meant to shit you down
10/4/18, 12:35 AM - Ricky: Shut*
10/4/18, 12:35 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah no worries haha
10/4/18, 12:35 AM - Parker: Honestly it’s on my mind way less than the beginning of summer for example
10/4/18, 12:35 AM - Parker: but yes obviously it’s on my mind
10/4/18, 12:35 AM - Tim Ko: Ok well that’s good
10/4/18, 12:36 AM - Parker: that’s also because it literally couldn’t have been more on my mind
10/4/18, 12:36 AM - Parker: it’s not stressing me out
10/4/18, 12:36 AM - Parker: i’ve just talked to more people and it’s made me realize that it’s not fair to me
10/4/18, 12:36 AM - Tim Ko: Ahh I see
10/4/18, 12:36 AM - Parker: ^
10/4/18, 12:36 AM - Tim Ko: For sure man
10/4/18, 12:36 AM - Ricky: I think it could be worth it, but she just doesn’t seem to be really 100% honest with you, like the excuse about her not wanting to hurt you is grade a bull shit, but I think she is confused herself so it’s messing the whole thing up
10/4/18, 12:37 AM - Parker: nothing could top the beginning of summer lol
10/4/18, 12:37 AM - Ricky: True
10/4/18, 12:37 AM - Tim Ko: You only see the good side of ppl when u first really like someone
10/4/18, 12:37 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah....lol
10/4/18, 12:37 AM - Parker: I agree with the hurting part. But i also believe that she genuinely doesn’t know what she wants and i can’t do much about that
10/4/18, 12:38 AM - Parker: she was honest with me about how she felt
10/4/18, 12:38 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah it seems like that
10/4/18, 12:38 AM - Ricky: She doesn’t want to hurt you, but In doing so, is hurting you
10/4/18, 12:38 AM - Parker: yes
10/4/18, 12:39 AM - Parker: but on a minor scale
10/4/18, 12:39 AM - Tim Ko: It really comes down to how much ur willing to put up with
10/4/18, 12:39 AM - Darren: Hey, this is sorta like the inverse of Christine and my break up
10/4/18, 12:39 AM - Parker: how so
10/4/18, 12:39 AM - Parker: not really relevant
10/4/18, 12:41 AM - Darren: Christine and I both could see we should probably break up, but neither of us wanted to hurt the other. I was sure I wanted to keep dating her, but I knew the distance was hurting her. She knew she'd be better off without me, but she wasn't sure what to do. We ended up waiting a really long time to make a big gal decision and it kinda hurt us both more
10/4/18, 12:43 AM - Parker: how is the inverse then
10/4/18, 12:43 AM - Parker: is it*
10/4/18, 12:46 AM - Darren: You and she are thinking about going out, but her indecision over whether she wants to date you is dragging things out and hurting you both. The sooner the better, but hope things can get better is preventing any short term decision
10/4/18, 12:46 AM - Darren: So I guess not the inverse, a parallel at the other end of the dating life cycle
10/4/18, 12:46 AM - Ricky: Damn
10/4/18, 12:47 AM - Ricky: Did she say anything back?
10/4/18, 12:47 AM - Ricky: If u wish to share
10/4/18, 12:47 AM - Darren: Which are both sort of just echoes of a parable about dating
10/4/18, 12:48 AM - Parker: ohh i get it yeah that’s true
10/4/18, 12:48 AM - Parker: Josh said wait til her recruitment stuff is done which is friday to tuesday and things chill out a bit and then talk to her again
10/4/18, 12:50 AM - Darren: She was amiable about everything. Said she'd been ignoring her emotions post breakup and my message brought all those emotions back and she just started crying. Tho she'd cry at the drop of a hat
10/4/18, 12:51 AM - Darren: She agreed that she doesn't regret anything that happened and that she still cares deeply about me even tho we don't talk
10/4/18, 12:52 AM - Darren: And said she's happy we had a clean breakup and that apparently Nic and Linnea's breakup was a shit show
10/4/18, 12:53 AM - Ricky: Damn
10/4/18, 12:53 AM - Ricky: I was gonna ask
10/4/18, 12:53 AM - Ricky: If they broke up
10/4/18, 12:53 AM - Ricky: Cuz I follow him on snap
10/4/18, 12:53 AM - Ricky: And he is with random girls all the damn time
10/4/18, 12:53 AM - Collin Hurst: what happened with them?
10/4/18, 12:54 AM - Ricky: But that’s the dream break up Darren,  it’s not the least painful in the slightest, but it’s the one they write movies about
10/4/18, 12:54 AM - Parker: yeah i think they did awhile ago
10/4/18, 12:54 AM - Parker: idk what happened tho
10/4/18, 12:54 AM - Darren: I didn't ask because I don't really feel like she should gossip with me about her best friends' relationship. Our relationship actually started because of nic and nays
10/4/18, 12:54 AM - Darren: A month ago today, apparently
10/4/18, 12:55 AM - Parker: Oh damn
10/4/18, 12:55 AM - Ricky: Damn
10/4/18, 12:58 AM - Darren: Weird coincidence that it was exactly one month after Christine and I broke up
10/4/18, 12:59 AM - Ricky: Weird indeed
10/4/18, 12:59 AM - Ricky: Well I am glad you have been able to remain friends and care for one another :)
10/4/18, 1:00 AM - Darren: Idk if that's whats happening
10/4/18, 1:00 AM - Ricky: I’m gonna sleep now and reflect on all previously stated relationships and ones of my own
10/4/18, 1:00 AM - Ricky: Not what’s happening maybe
10/4/18, 1:00 AM - Ricky: But seems like it’s still a potential
10/4/18, 1:01 AM - Ricky: Gl big D, you are a stronger man than most
10/4/18, 1:01 AM - Darren: Night
10/4/18, 1:05 AM - Tim Ko: ^mmmm amen to that
10/4/18, 1:05 AM - Tim Ko: As I said yesterday “a man with true balls”
10/4/18, 1:06 AM - Darren: To parker
10/4/18, 1:06 AM - Darren: Which is absolutely true
10/4/18, 1:06 AM - Tim Ko: You and parker :))

10/4/18, 11:27 AM - Tim Ko: Doesn’t have to be a success!
10/4/18, 11:27 AM - Tim Ko: I mean look at me with that Oregon girl 😂
10/4/18, 11:27 AM - Tim Ko: That was a complete failure
10/4/18, 11:28 AM - Darren: In every sense of the word
10/4/18, 11:29 AM - Alex Starr: True but that doesn’t mean I have any more stories
10/4/18, 3:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: Guys i bought italian weed

10/4/18, 4:13 PM - Ricky: Cuz I’m Taiwan that shit is punishable by death (no one gets scentenced to death but it is legally punishable by death
10/4/18, 4:30 PM - Parker: It’s decriminalized in a lot of european countries
10/4/18, 4:30 PM - Parker: legal in some
10/4/18, 4:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: Idk

10/4/18, 8:46 PM - Collin Hurst: And I still need to talk to Holly
10/4/18, 8:46 PM - Alex Starr: That’ll be the only thing that’s full length I imagine
10/4/18, 8:46 PM - Darren: Explain that joke
10/4/18, 8:46 PM - Alex Starr: Small dick joke plain and simple
10/4/18, 8:47 PM - Collin Hurst: Cause I'm not going to have a boner
10/4/18, 8:47 PM - Alex Starr: Movies used to be called full length feature films
10/4/18, 8:47 PM - Darren: What movie?
10/4/18, 8:47 PM - Alex Starr: Was gonna make a porn joke but it felt in poor taste
10/4/18, 8:47 PM - Darren: I know this
10/4/18, 8:47 PM - Darren: You stop that
10/4/18, 8:47 PM - Collin Hurst: Secret life of Walter Mitty cause it's my top 3 and she hasn't seen it

10/4/18, 8:48 PM - Darren: Oh, watching a movie, not going to the movies
10/4/18, 8:48 PM - Darren: I was gonna ask why you thought it was a good idea to go watch Venom
10/4/18, 8:48 PM - Alex Starr: Is that out?
10/4/18, 8:48 PM - Darren: I think it just came out
10/4/18, 8:49 PM - Alex Starr: What’s ur plan collin?
10/4/18, 8:50 PM - Ricky: Lmao off to a good start with the ladies
10/4/18, 8:50 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah collin I have no idea how you do it
10/4/18, 8:50 PM - Alex Starr: I’m completely hapless
10/4/18, 8:52 PM - Collin Hurst: No moves gonna happen just two friends watching a movie
10/4/18, 8:52 PM - Collin Hurst: I said it was BYOBR
10/4/18, 8:53 PM - Collin Hurst: Bring your own backrest

10/4/18, 8:53 PM - Collin Hurst: I'll let her make the moves whenever she is comfortable
10/4/18, 8:53 PM - Collin Hurst: It's in my room lol
10/4/18, 8:53 PM - Ricky: Lol, alex you capable
10/4/18, 8:53 PM - Ricky: Collin just lives among a lot
10/4/18, 8:53 PM - Alex Starr: The evidence strongly disagrees
10/4/18, 8:54 PM - Ricky: I feel like if now alex was in dorms, it would go differently
10/4/18, 8:54 PM - Alex Starr: I meant as a back rest
10/4/18, 8:54 PM - Alex Starr: Or vice verse
10/4/18, 8:54 PM - Alex Starr: The year in a dorm also disagrees
10/4/18, 8:54 PM - Collin Hurst: This message was deleted
10/4/18, 8:55 PM - Alex Starr: Don’t think I didn’t see haha
10/4/18, 8:55 PM - Alex Starr: Tho ur right
10/4/18, 8:55 PM - Collin Hurst: ^
10/4/18, 8:55 PM - Alex Starr: Damn it
10/4/18, 8:55 PM - Collin Hurst: I meant to arrow that it just sent late
10/4/18, 8:55 PM - Darren: Goddam it
10/4/18, 8:56 PM - Darren: Lothlorean seemed like a weird dorm to be in socially for freshman year
10/4/18, 8:56 PM - Alex Starr: It definitely was.  Not to mention there was nary a Galadriel in sight
10/4/18, 8:58 PM - Alex Starr: I also probably shouldn’t talk like I’m in a western
10/4/18, 8:59 PM - Ricky: Does that mean there are girls where you live now?
10/4/18, 8:59 PM - Alex Starr: Nope
10/4/18, 8:59 PM - Ricky: Oh lmao, then idk what it means to be in a western
10/4/18, 9:00 PM - Alex Starr: Oh I just meant that saying “nary a dame in sight” or something along those lines is like dialogue from a western
10/4/18, 9:02 PM - Parker: It is what u make of it tho
10/4/18, 9:02 PM - Parker: js
10/4/18, 9:02 PM - Ricky: Hahahah
10/4/18, 9:02 PM - Ricky: Oh
10/4/18, 9:02 PM - Alex Starr: Is it tho?
10/4/18, 9:02 PM - Ricky: Yes haha
10/4/18, 9:02 PM - Parker: to an extent yes
10/4/18, 9:02 PM - Parker: mostly yes
10/4/18, 9:03 PM - Alex Starr: Well then I’m not very good at making something of it
10/4/18, 9:03 PM - Ricky: Haha I guess not
10/4/18, 9:03 PM - Ricky: But it don’t mean u can’t
10/4/18, 9:04 PM - Alex Starr: Can’t or won’t?
10/4/18, 9:04 PM - Alex Starr: Either?
10/4/18, 9:05 PM - Ricky: Ur choice
10/4/18, 9:05 PM - Ricky: Bit chance
10/4/18, 9:05 PM - Ricky: Not*
10/4/18, 9:05 PM - Ricky: Either sounds like u don’t control the outcome
10/4/18, 9:06 PM - Alex Starr: I disagree fundamentally but see your point
10/4/18, 9:06 PM - Alex Starr: Problem is it’s been made 10 odd times with no change
10/4/18, 9:14 PM - Tim Ko: Lol collin
10/4/18, 9:15 PM - Tim Ko: U are quite a man
10/4/18, 9:15 PM - Tim Ko: Getting reeled in, then dropped, now u back
10/4/18, 9:16 PM - Collin Hurst: well I wasn't dropped
10/4/18, 9:16 PM - Darren: Put on a shelf
10/4/18, 9:16 PM - Collin Hurst: shes just not ready for anything rn
10/4/18, 9:17 PM - Tim Ko: That’s a better term
10/4/18, 9:17 PM - Collin Hurst: which is what I was assuming from the start
10/4/18, 9:17 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah
10/4/18, 9:17 PM - Tim Ko: Are u into her a bit?
10/4/18, 9:17 PM - Collin Hurst: I was suprised that she even mentioned that she was thinking of doing stuff with me
10/4/18, 9:17 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah I am but I'm not expecting anything considering she broke up with her bf on wednesday
10/4/18, 9:17 PM - Darren: Put in a tupperware and back into the fridge for later
10/4/18, 9:18 PM - Collin Hurst: the pie is too hot gotta cool it down
10/4/18, 9:18 PM - Tim Ko: Haha darren
10/4/18, 9:18 PM - Darren: Get it
10/4/18, 9:18 PM - Darren: It's cuz Collin is a snack
10/4/18, 9:19 PM - Tim Ko: Well Collin u did say u weren’t gonna go for anyone on ur floor
10/4/18, 9:19 PM - Tim Ko: And here we are in week 2...😅
10/4/18, 9:22 PM - Parker: more like her catering and a professional chef because collins a 5 course meal
10/4/18, 9:22 PM - Parker: get*
10/4/18, 9:22 PM - Darren: Collin's mom is a damn good chef
10/4/18, 9:25 PM - Collin Hurst: I said that my office had very good advice on not going for people on same floor
10/4/18, 9:25 PM - Collin Hurst: It sounded very good until maya walked in
10/4/18, 9:26 PM - Alex Starr: There’s always a linear negative relationship between hotness and taking advice
10/4/18, 9:26 PM - Darren: Thanks barney
10/4/18, 9:27 PM - Collin Hurst: for a second I was thinking of the purple dinosaur
10/4/18, 9:27 PM - Alex Starr: Hey it’s 83% accurate
10/4/18, 9:30 PM - Tim Ko: Mmm I see
10/6/18, 12:15 AM - Collin Hurst: Talked with Holly, good talk
10/6/18, 12:15 AM - Collin Hurst: Also made out with Maya

10/6/18, 12:40 AM - Tim Ko: What’s it like at a beginning of a relationship
10/6/18, 12:40 AM - Tim Ko: Like does it feel any different than when u were hanging out before u two officially dated
10/6/18, 12:40 AM - Tim Ko: Cuz tonight felt kinda the same with Julia
10/6/18, 12:40 AM - Tim Ko: And idk what to think of that
10/6/18, 12:52 AM - Parker: did u boof
10/6/18, 12:54 AM - Tim Ko: No lol
10/6/18, 12:55 AM - Darren: Tim showing restraint for once
10/6/18, 12:55 AM - Tim Ko: Lol
10/6/18, 12:55 AM - Tim Ko: It was tough
10/6/18, 12:56 AM - Parker: hahaha

10/6/18, 12:56 AM - Darren: Grab her by the
10/6/18, 12:56 AM - Darren: Hand
10/6/18, 12:57 AM - Tim Ko: She might have something on her mind
10/6/18, 12:57 AM - Tim Ko: Lol
10/6/18, 1:23 AM - Parker: ^^^
10/6/18, 3:23 AM - Jason Greenberg: If this is a cop out thats so lame
10/6/18, 3:23 AM - Jason Greenberg: If its not thats also lame
10/6/18, 4:03 AM - Darren: Just lame all around
10/6/18, 4:59 AM - Jason Greenberg: Quadriplegic
10/6/18, 4:59 AM - Jason Greenberg: I just want whats best for you pman
10/6/18, 7:31 AM - Parker: idk if it’s a cop out bc i think she might actually feel that way
10/6/18, 7:31 AM - Parker: like the fook
10/6/18, 7:35 AM - Jason Greenberg: Not to change the subject but speaking of the fook
10/6/18, 7:35 AM - Jason Greenberg: Whos hyped af for mcgregor khabib!!
10/6/18, 7:40 AM - Parker: ME
10/6/18, 7:40 AM - Parker: gonna be lit
10/6/18, 7:48 AM - Jason Greenberg: Fuck yeah dude
10/6/18, 7:49 AM - Jason Greenberg: I think khabib was fuckin scared at the face off
10/6/18, 7:55 AM - Parker: i would be too haha
10/6/18, 8:38 AM - Jason Greenberg: lol true
10/6/18, 9:28 AM - Matt Casali: Dump her
10/6/18, 9:29 AM - Jason Greenberg: chill matty
10/6/18, 9:31 AM - Matt Casali: Idk man, just doesn't seem worth the stress
10/6/18, 9:32 AM - Matt Casali: Pushing her to date isn't gonna make her feel more comfortable about it, it's just gonna make her feel more pressure
10/6/18, 9:32 AM - Matt Casali: Give her space, let her figure her shit out, you do your stuff and she'll come to you
10/6/18, 9:34 AM - Parker: that’s what i’m doing^
10/6/18, 9:34 AM - Parker: i’m not forcing anything lol
10/6/18, 9:34 AM - Parker: and even if it seems like it i’m really not that stressed about it
10/6/18, 9:35 AM - Matt Casali: I guess I'm only seeing the side of you that's bringing it up in the chat most days and not the other 99% of your life
10/6/18, 9:36 AM - Matt Casali: And I'm also thinking about the stress it caused you this summer
10/6/18, 9:36 AM - Parker: yeah true
10/6/18, 9:36 AM - Matt Casali: And right before you talked to her at the beginning of the quarter
10/6/18, 9:36 AM - Matt Casali: And a whole lot of other times
10/6/18, 9:36 AM - Parker: over the summer yeah
10/6/18, 9:36 AM - Parker: rn i’m pretty okay haha
10/6/18, 9:37 AM - Matt Casali: Okay, well then that's good
10/6/18, 9:37 AM - Matt Casali: As long as you have a finger on your pulse and you dont feel like you're forcing anyone into a decision that they wouldnt make on their own
10/6/18, 9:37 AM - Matt Casali: Which I dont think you would purposefully do
10/6/18, 9:37 AM - Matt Casali: But it's easy to do on accident
10/6/18, 9:38 AM - Jason Greenberg: where is this coming from?
10/6/18, 9:38 AM - Ricky: Matt’s want for parker to be happy
10/6/18, 9:39 AM - Matt Casali: ^
10/6/18, 9:41 AM - Jason Greenberg: i gotcha
10/6/18, 9:41 AM - Parker: i’m definitely not forcing anything
10/6/18, 9:42 AM - Parker: i just think all the concerns she has or doubts are somewhat illegitimate haha
10/6/18, 9:42 AM - Parker: idk if that’s the right word but
10/6/18, 9:42 AM - Jason Greenberg: well what do you mean?
10/6/18, 9:43 AM - Ricky: Send her a paper that says “wanna date? Check yes or no”

And then when she grabs a pen grab her hand and check yes, and boom, she is ur gf
10/6/18, 9:44 AM - Parker: a lot of the things she’s said of why she’s hesitant or scared to commit are things that i don’t really care about and sound like just her overthinking things
10/6/18, 9:44 AM - Parker: such as she’s not nice enough for me lol
10/6/18, 9:44 AM - Parker: u right
10/6/18, 9:44 AM - Jason Greenberg: lol
10/6/18, 9:45 AM - Ricky: Yeah honestly, it seems like she’s just kinda picked an excuse and sticking with it
10/6/18, 9:45 AM - Ricky: But also, that might mean she is just generally not ready to date
10/6/18, 9:46 AM - Parker: but the thing is i think she actually feels that way
10/6/18, 9:46 AM - Parker: and i’m not sure why
10/6/18, 9:46 AM - Ricky: Which is ok, but I don’t get why she wouldn’t say that... and if she really does think that, then idk, it’s better to have loved and lost then never loved at all
10/6/18, 9:47 AM - Parker: eexxxxactly
10/6/18, 9:47 AM - Matt Casali: Both reasons are reason enough to skedaddle
10/6/18, 9:47 AM - Matt Casali: Dont try to change her mind thooooo
10/6/18, 9:48 AM - Matt Casali: That ends poorly
10/6/18, 9:48 AM - Ricky: Why not?
10/6/18, 9:48 AM - Jason Greenberg: mmmmmmm ok lets say thats true: you somehow console her enough and maaybe she realizes that its bs, but your relationship would start of being unbalanced
10/6/18, 9:48 AM - Ricky: For some people
10/6/18, 9:48 AM - Jason Greenberg: right
10/6/18, 9:48 AM - Matt Casali: ^100%
10/6/18, 9:48 AM - Ricky: You guys are like Michael and Jan
10/6/18, 9:49 AM - Ricky: This is the first of many fights you are gonna have
10/6/18, 9:49 AM - Matt Casali: Booooo
10/6/18, 9:49 AM - Matt Casali: Ricky noooooo
10/6/18, 9:49 AM - Matt Casali: I'm sorry but if a relationship starts off with a fight then it's bad news
10/6/18, 9:49 AM - Matt Casali: Idk if you were joking or not tho
10/6/18, 9:49 AM - Ricky: I know, I was joking hahha
10/6/18, 9:49 AM - Matt Casali: Ohhh okay haha
10/6/18, 9:50 AM - Parker: Lol it’s not a fight
10/6/18, 9:50 AM - Ricky: Believe it or not, I do not condone my friends dating a Jan Levinson Gould, but no more Gould
10/6/18, 9:51 AM - Matt Casali: Hahhaa
10/6/18, 10:24 AM - Alex Starr: I know my opinion on this kinda stuff is generally discounted, but I strongly disagree with the forcing it never works out idea
10/6/18, 10:36 AM - Tim Ko: Lol
10/6/18, 10:37 AM - Tim Ko: Well parker if it’s not causing u too much stress, and u willing to wait it out, then it could turn out good
10/6/18, 10:38 AM - Tim Ko: Cuz damn u are showing her a lot of patience and kindness
10/6/18, 10:46 AM - Alex Starr: Or would it be kinder to let her go?
10/6/18, 10:49 AM - Parker: no
10/6/18, 10:50 AM - Parker: that’s my middle name
10/6/18, 10:50 AM - Parker: jk
10/6/18, 10:50 AM - Alex Starr: We’ll see haha
10/6/18, 11:04 AM - Tim Ko: Well it’s not like parker is pressuring anything upon her, he is literally sitting in his rocket ship, waiting for tyrsten to join him as she oscillates between the door of the ship and the ground, and not forcing her to come in
10/6/18, 11:06 AM - Alex Starr: It started off promising but then petered out
10/6/18, 11:06 AM - Alex Starr: The analogy I mean
10/6/18, 11:07 AM - Alex Starr: That is pressuring her somewhat inherently cuz if he just flew off or modified the rocket to one of friendship then there would be less pressure
10/6/18, 11:13 AM - Parker: ^
10/6/18, 11:13 AM - Parker: hahaha
10/6/18, 11:14 AM - Tim Ko: I tried haha
10/6/18, 11:19 AM - Alex Starr: Ya gotta keep working at it
10/6/18, 11:21 AM - Parker: i do realize that i don’t tell u the good things though so you have a skewed view of it all haha
10/6/18, 11:22 AM - Parker: on a positive note, since we’ve talked she’s been less weird and more how she usually is
10/6/18, 11:22 AM - Parker: /friendly
10/6/18, 11:22 AM - Jason Greenberg: good good
10/6/18, 11:45 AM - Tim Ko: That’s good!!
10/6/18, 12:07 PM - Alex Starr: Thanks emperor
10/6/18, 1:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: What
10/6/18, 1:04 PM - Matt Casali: good.... GOOD... use your anger..
10/6/18, 1:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ohhh hahaha
10/6/18, 1:09 PM - Ricky: ❤
10/6/18, 1:09 PM - Ricky: Yayyyyy
10/8/18, 10:01 PM - Alex Starr: Julia is here with Tim
10/8/18, 10:01 PM - Alex Starr: Should I casually start setting up an air mattress in the kitchen?
10/8/18, 10:02 PM - Collin Hurst: Just start moving out
10/8/18, 10:02 PM - Alex Starr: That seems extreme
10/8/18, 10:02 PM - Alex Starr: But an air mattress sends a clear message
10/8/18, 10:05 PM - Darren: If they are in your room, casually take a sock and put it on the door on your way out
10/8/18, 10:05 PM - Darren: When Julia eventually leaves, she will see it and be confused
10/8/18, 10:06 PM - Alex Starr: I’d also thought through that one
10/8/18, 10:06 PM - Collin Hurst: Lmaoo
10/8/18, 10:26 PM - Alex Starr: I would’ve if they were in the bedroom
10/8/18, 10:27 PM - Parker: Hahaha
10/8/18, 10:28 PM - Parker: damn they’re boofing in the kitchen??
10/8/18, 10:29 PM - Collin Hurst: That's hot
10/8/18, 10:30 PM - Darren: They're respecting Jesus, our Lord and savior, in the kitchen
10/8/18, 10:32 PM - Alex Starr: And “working” on homework
10/8/18, 10:35 PM - Alex Starr: I dunno Christ taught love
10/8/18, 10:35 PM - Alex Starr: Not to mention nicknamed his dick “the reformation” after he was done with Mary Magdalene
10/8/18, 10:35 PM - Alex Starr: Damn I was being so politically correct and then blew it
10/8/18, 10:36 PM - Parker: huh
10/8/18, 10:36 PM - Alex Starr: To which part?
10/8/18, 11:14 PM - Parker: idk
10/8/18, 11:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: I'm sure that joke is funnier to tim
10/8/18, 11:49 PM - Collin Hurst: Ricky your relax playlist is good for sexytime
10/8/18, 11:50 PM - Ricky: Lmao, I’m glad your enjoying it :)
10/8/18, 11:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ha
10/8/18, 11:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: Coll try the Currents album for maximum sexiness
10/8/18, 11:59 PM - Darren: Tame Impala?
10/8/18, 11:59 PM - Darren: Those songs sad
10/8/18, 11:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah
10/8/18, 11:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: Thats what makes them true
10/8/18, 11:59 PM - Ricky: Jason likes banging with tears running down his face
10/9/18, 12:00 AM - Parker: hahaha
10/9/18, 12:00 AM - Darren: I don't feel sexy when he's singing about moving on
10/9/18, 12:01 AM - Darren: Although, credit where credit is due, the music video for the less I know the better really gets me going
10/9/18, 12:02 AM - Darren: It has Bigfoot sex, for some reason
10/9/18, 12:14 AM - Matt Casali: Collin is trying to brag about banging Maya
10/9/18, 12:14 AM - Matt Casali: Congrats Collin
10/9/18, 12:15 AM - Matt Casali: 🎉🎉🎉
10/9/18, 12:15 AM - Darren: It's so subtle we almost missed it
10/9/18, 12:30 AM - Collin Hurst: lol
10/9/18, 12:32 AM - Jason Greenberg: A+ banter
10/9/18, 12:39 AM - Tim Ko: Omg lol
10/9/18, 12:40 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah I got like half an hours worth of work done in 2 HRs
10/9/18, 12:40 AM - Tim Ko: Rip

10/9/18, 12:52 AM - Tim Ko: One day I’ll go for it
10/9/18, 12:53 AM - Collin Hurst: Do ittttttt
10/9/18, 12:55 AM - Vaughn: Daaaamn gg collin!
10/9/18, 12:55 AM - Darren: Listen to currents while holding hands
10/9/18, 12:59 AM - Tim Ko: Lol I haven’t heard it yet
10/9/18, 1:42 AM - Parker: Lol yesss tim
10/9/18, 7:42 AM - Alex Starr: Presumably similar to what maya said
10/9/18, 8:56 AM - Collin Hurst: Oof
10/9/18, 9:20 AM - Ricky: Colli, just added slow dancing in the dark to my relax playlist for ya ;)
10/9/18, 9:21 AM - Vaughn: Whoa I was humming that song while you sent that
10/9/18, 10:36 AM - Parker: Ooooo
10/9/18, 4:02 PM - Ricky: No eayyyy

10/9/18, 10:40 PM - Ricky: Wait, so collin, did u and maya boof?
10/9/18, 10:40 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah
10/9/18, 10:40 PM - Alex Starr: The whole world could tell ricky haha
10/9/18, 10:41 PM - Collin Hurst: she was confused about what she wanted to do for a while but then she said she wants to give it a shot
10/9/18, 10:41 PM - Collin Hurst: it being just hanging with me
10/9/18, 10:41 PM - Collin Hurst: cause she was feeling weird since she just broke up with her bf
10/9/18, 10:41 PM - Ricky: Lmao, doesn’t she live on ur floor?
10/9/18, 10:41 PM - Darren: *banging
10/9/18, 10:41 PM - Ricky: ^
10/9/18, 10:42 PM - Darren: Why'd she dump him?
10/9/18, 10:42 PM - Collin Hurst: idk I havent asked about that
10/9/18, 10:42 PM - Collin Hurst: just appreciating consequences
10/9/18, 10:42 PM - Matt Casali: Ew
10/9/18, 10:42 PM - Ricky: Wasn’t not on the same floor like ur only rule hahaha
10/9/18, 10:42 PM - Ricky: Is that her appreciating or you?
10/9/18, 10:43 PM - Matt Casali: Well, maybe not ew
10/9/18, 10:43 PM - Darren: His one rule is don't kill people
10/9/18, 10:43 PM - Ricky: That’s Batman, no?
10/9/18, 10:43 PM - Collin Hurst: I did think it was a good rule when people told me it, but that all fell away when I saw her lmao
10/9/18, 10:43 PM - Matt Casali: Awwwwwww howwwww cuuuuuttteee
10/9/18, 10:43 PM - Ricky: Wait, so what are you then? Haha
10/9/18, 10:43 PM - Ricky: Also fwb?
10/9/18, 10:43 PM - Ricky: Or undeclared
10/9/18, 10:44 PM - Darren: Idk, knowing why she dumped her boyfriend like 10 days into school seems somewhat important
10/9/18, 10:44 PM - Matt Casali: "I need to boof that" at first sight!
10/9/18, 10:44 PM - Darren: Matt, you need to tone it down
10/9/18, 10:44 PM - Collin Hurst: undeclared
10/9/18, 10:44 PM - Matt Casali: It was because she saw Collin walking in a towel to the showers
10/9/18, 10:44 PM - Ricky: Hey man, if it works it works
10/9/18, 10:44 PM - Darren: That's a pretty compelling reason tbh
10/9/18, 10:44 PM - Ricky: Don’t hate the playa hate the game
10/9/18, 10:45 PM - Ricky: ^
10/9/18, 10:45 PM - Ricky: It’s up there for sure haah
10/9/18, 10:45 PM - Ricky: I do find the instant post boyfriend boof a bit of a cheap move, but I guess someone’s gotta be the rebound
10/9/18, 10:46 PM - Collin Hurst: I feel like she thought that she had to have sex with me for some reason
10/9/18, 10:46 PM - Ricky: Hahahaha
10/9/18, 10:46 PM - Ricky: Elaborate
10/9/18, 10:47 PM - Ricky: If u have more to elaborate on
10/9/18, 10:47 PM - Collin Hurst: although I mentioned that to her and she said she wanted to
10/9/18, 10:47 PM - Collin Hurst: I can tell shes pretty inexperienced
10/9/18, 10:47 PM - Ricky: Like as you we’re about to bang you said “you want to have sex with me”
10/9/18, 10:47 PM - Darren: Ok senpai
10/9/18, 10:47 PM - Ricky: Wait lmao
10/9/18, 10:47 PM - Ricky: Ok
10/9/18, 10:48 PM - Collin Hurst: She said she was nervous and I said that we didn't have to do anything
10/9/18, 10:48 PM - Ricky: Ohhhhhh
10/9/18, 10:48 PM - Collin Hurst: but she said she wanted to still
10/9/18, 10:48 PM - Ricky: Good man
10/9/18, 10:48 PM - Ricky: Haha I wasn’t worried about the consensual part of it
10/9/18, 10:48 PM - Ricky: But I’m glad it was
10/9/18, 10:49 PM - Ricky: Why did she “feel like she had to”
10/9/18, 10:49 PM - Ricky: Or was the more of a vibe thing?
10/9/18, 10:49 PM - Collin Hurst: she didn't say that but I felt like she was trying to rush herself
10/9/18, 10:49 PM - Collin Hurst: cause I think when she told me she liked me and I said so too that something had to happen because of that
10/9/18, 10:49 PM - Collin Hurst: vibe thing
10/9/18, 10:50 PM - Ricky: Gooootcha
10/9/18, 10:51 PM - Ricky: Well I’m glad it worked out
10/9/18, 10:51 PM - Ricky: And hope you stay friends
10/9/18, 10:51 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah
10/9/18, 10:51 PM - Ricky: Or continue to bang or however this works haah
10/9/18, 10:51 PM - Collin Hurst: not sure where we are going but we'll see
10/9/18, 10:51 PM - Ricky: 👌🏻👍
10/9/18, 10:51 PM - Ricky: I’m excited for what the future holds
10/9/18, 10:51 PM - Collin Hurst: she did ask if I would consider dating not as a proposal but a question and I said I would need to get to know her better
10/9/18, 10:52 PM - Collin Hurst: aka dates
10/9/18, 10:52 PM - Ricky: Damn
10/9/18, 10:52 PM - Darren: Collin isn't a slut that will just go on dates Willy nilly
10/9/18, 10:52 PM - Collin Hurst: don't get to just fuck me and dtr

10/9/18, 11:52 PM - Parker: hahahaha
10/11/18, 11:43 PM - Collin Hurst: After we had sex this weekend we were getting feisty again but then she remebered she had practice and said we would continue when she comes back
10/11/18, 11:45 PM - Collin Hurst: and then she doesnt say anything after and the next morning she texts me that she had a mental breakdown
10/11/18, 11:45 PM - Collin Hurst: and then we talk and she says that she doesnt know what to do cause she really likes me but she doesnt feel she is ready to let herself be vulnerable to another guy yet
10/11/18, 11:45 PM - Ricky: Damn
10/11/18, 11:46 PM - Ricky: Sounds like you should give her some space?
10/11/18, 11:46 PM - Ricky: Seems like she gotta figure this out
10/11/18, 11:46 PM - Collin Hurst: and shes going to therapy to deal with stuff
10/11/18, 11:46 PM - Vaughn: But
10/11/18, 11:46 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah I thinnk so, but she says she still wants to hang and get to know each other better too
10/11/18, 11:46 PM - Ricky: Oh damn
10/11/18, 11:46 PM - Ricky: Well go her for going to do that
10/11/18, 11:47 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah
10/11/18, 11:47 PM - Darren: Sounds like you need to stop fucking her
10/11/18, 11:47 PM - Ricky: ^?
10/11/18, 11:47 PM - Ricky: ^*
10/11/18, 11:47 PM - Darren: If you just make the decision then it's final
10/11/18, 11:48 PM - Collin Hurst: she kinda feels like she is pissing me off for putting me on hold or whatever but im totally fine with waiting and just being friends for now
10/11/18, 11:48 PM - Collin Hurst: but we'll see
10/11/18, 11:48 PM - Ricky: Unless u wanna date her
10/11/18, 11:48 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah were probably not going to do that if she sticks to her word
10/11/18, 11:48 PM - Ricky: IFFFFF
10/11/18, 11:49 PM - Ricky: you’re also allowed to say no
10/11/18, 11:49 PM - Ricky: Haha
10/11/18, 11:49 PM - Darren: There's something morally dubious about not saying no when you know she isn't totally all there
10/11/18, 11:49 PM - Ricky: Quite dubious
10/11/18, 11:50 PM - Collin Hurst: true
10/11/18, 11:51 PM - Collin Hurst: I just told her to make all her decisions when things aren't all hot and spicy
10/11/18, 11:53 PM - Darren: That seems reasonable
10/11/18, 11:53 PM - Darren: But id consider being proactive
10/11/18, 11:54 PM - Collin Hurst: true
10/11/18, 11:54 PM - Collin Hurst: idk what shes feeling, but I feel like now that it has already happened theres not much to do to fux it
10/11/18, 11:54 PM - Collin Hurst: fix it
10/11/18, 11:55 PM - Ricky: I mean
10/11/18, 11:55 PM - Ricky: Fix what?
10/11/18, 11:55 PM - Ricky: Like undo having sex? Cuz that’s not the issue haha
10/11/18, 11:55 PM - Collin Hurst: I haven't really asked or talked about what the issue is
10/11/18, 11:55 PM - Collin Hurst: Actually wait im dumb
10/11/18, 11:55 PM - Collin Hurst: nvr mind I just said it lol
10/11/18, 11:56 PM - Collin Hurst: She feels like she wants to open up to me, but is not ready yet since she just got out of a relationship
10/11/18, 11:56 PM - Collin Hurst: thats pretty much it
10/11/18, 11:56 PM - Ricky: Gotcha
10/11/18, 11:57 PM - Darren: Her sexual confusion takes a sideline to her emotional confusion
10/11/18, 11:57 PM - Collin Hurst: yes that too
10/11/18, 11:57 PM - Ricky: I’d be careful to not to get a reputation of the guy who bangs recently broken up girls
10/11/18, 11:57 PM - Darren: You should address the emotional issues and realize having sex with her contributes to the emotional confusion
10/11/18, 11:57 PM - Collin Hurst: I think she was trying out a fwb kinda thing but that didnt really work out
10/11/18, 11:57 PM - Collin Hurst: hey this is the first
10/11/18, 11:57 PM - Ricky: Haha I know
10/11/18, 11:58 PM - Ricky: I’d just be careful
10/11/18, 11:58 PM - Ricky: The whole same floor thing can make gossip spread in a heartbeat
10/11/18, 11:58 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah thats pretty much why we are not going do anything for now
10/11/18, 11:58 PM - Darren: Well, you probably wouldn't be in this situation in the first place
10/11/18, 11:58 PM - Collin Hurst: im pretty sure it has spread
10/11/18, 11:58 PM - Parker: ^
10/11/18, 11:58 PM - Parker: ^^^*
10/11/18, 11:58 PM - Parker: lol
10/11/18, 11:58 PM - Darren: There was a big iffff beforehand that said you probably would continue fucking
10/11/18, 11:59 PM - Collin Hurst: well cause she talked about not doing stuff but then flipped
10/11/18, 11:59 PM - Matt Casali: No haha
10/11/18, 11:59 PM - Matt Casali: Sorry to break it to ya bud
10/12/18, 12:00 AM - Ricky: Break what?
10/12/18, 12:00 AM - Tim Ko: This is like a Jan and Michael situation
10/12/18, 12:00 AM - Collin Hurst: oh shit I forgot about Matt Hunt
10/12/18, 12:00 AM - Ricky: Oh nooooo holly?!
10/12/18, 12:01 AM - Collin Hurst: dammit Im that guy
10/12/18, 12:01 AM - Ricky: Who matt hunt?

10/12/18, 12:01 AM - Matt Casali: Meh more like two weeks
10/12/18, 12:01 AM - Darren: A month is not a long time
10/12/18, 12:01 AM - Ricky: I know
10/12/18, 12:01 AM - Parker: a month isn’t long lol
10/12/18, 12:01 AM - Ricky: But still funny
10/12/18, 12:02 AM - Collin Hurst: damnit
10/12/18, 12:02 AM - Darren: A month is pretty short amount of time
10/12/18, 12:02 AM - Ricky: Wait, a month isn’t actually that long if u think about it
10/12/18, 12:02 AM - Matt Casali: Dont worry about it Collin, just make sure you're taking into account these people's emotional statuses and well brings before things get "all hot and spicy"
10/12/18, 12:02 AM - Parker: I thought a month was a long time, but i researched it and it actually isn’t that long
10/12/18, 12:03 AM - Collin Hurst: I mean, I let them make the decisions
10/12/18, 12:03 AM - Darren: When you know they are emotionally confused
10/12/18, 12:03 AM - Ricky: She was drunk and didn’t say no so....
10/12/18, 12:03 AM - Collin Hurst: In both cases they mentioned it/wanted it first
10/12/18, 12:03 AM - Darren: I just let her drive the car...
10/12/18, 12:03 AM - Ricky: Not same thing
10/12/18, 12:03 AM - Collin Hurst: Except I didn't
10/12/18, 12:04 AM - Darren: Bull shit
10/12/18, 12:04 AM - Ricky: She just broke up with her boyfriend
10/12/18, 12:04 AM - Ricky: U can’t say u didn’t have a hunch hahah
10/12/18, 12:04 AM - Parker: its a safe assumption lol
10/12/18, 12:04 AM - Matt Casali: Understandable. But now you know that when someone just broke up with someone the day prior, it's best not to become too intimate with them
10/12/18, 12:04 AM - Matt Casali: 9 times out of 10 they will be emotionally confused
10/12/18, 12:04 AM - Darren: Pretty sure you even said it in the chat when you sent screenshots of your convo
10/12/18, 12:05 AM - Collin Hurst: Yeah true but we had multiple talks about the fact that we don't have to do anything
10/12/18, 12:05 AM - Collin Hurst: yes I learned that now
10/12/18, 12:05 AM - Matt Casali: Btw I'm saying this for your benefit mostly
10/12/18, 12:05 AM - Collin Hurst: Yeah
10/12/18, 12:06 AM - Matt Casali: I feel like you deserve to have a long standing relationship
10/12/18, 12:06 AM - Collin Hurst: Actually I was drunk when Maya and I had sex, she was sober af
10/12/18, 12:06 AM - Matt Casali: I dont know what that relationship would like, but these people have been too confusing
10/12/18, 12:06 AM - Matt Casali: *would look like
10/12/18, 12:06 AM - Collin Hurst: ouch?
10/12/18, 12:06 AM - Darren: Not actually relevant
10/12/18, 12:07 AM - Matt Casali: No? I was trying to be nice haha sorry
10/12/18, 12:07 AM - Darren: This feels like a "Alex and Darren are good people" moment
10/12/18, 12:07 AM - Parker: i took it as a compliment dw matt
10/12/18, 12:07 AM - Matt Casali: How ya feeling about that?
10/12/18, 12:07 AM - Collin Hurst: wait I read that as you don't deserve to have a long lasting relationship hahahahah
10/12/18, 12:07 AM - Parker: hahaha
10/12/18, 12:07 AM - Collin Hurst: fine we had talked about having sex before
10/12/18, 12:08 AM - Matt Casali: Doesnt mean you had to feel good about having sex then
10/12/18, 12:08 AM - Matt Casali: Jw
10/12/18, 12:08 AM - Matt Casali: Dont have to delve into it
10/12/18, 12:08 AM - Collin Hurst: I mean it was fine I just hope it didnt mess her up emotionally
10/12/18, 12:08 AM - Collin Hurst: it def played a part
10/12/18, 12:08 AM - Ricky: It’s ok collin, the important thing is you didn’t take advantage of her
10/12/18, 12:09 AM - Darren: In some sense
10/12/18, 12:09 AM - Matt Casali: I'm honestly more worried she did the reverse
10/12/18, 12:09 AM - Ricky: Lol, I was tryna keep it a little light
10/12/18, 12:10 AM - Ricky: She may have used collin
10/12/18, 12:10 AM - Matt Casali: ^while he was drunk
10/12/18, 12:10 AM - Ricky: But Idk if take advantage is the same
10/12/18, 12:10 AM - Matt Casali: Uh oh no no
10/12/18, 12:10 AM - Ricky: Ohhhh true
10/12/18, 12:10 AM - Collin Hurst: I feel like she went through with it b/c of a mix of 1. in the moment 2. she felt like she had to make moves cause we confessed we like each other 3. She wanted to try fwb
10/12/18, 12:11 AM - Ricky: I have no problem with that, except the timing I think
10/12/18, 12:11 AM - Matt Casali: Fwb denotes a prior friendship though
10/12/18, 12:11 AM - Matt Casali: And this
10/12/18, 12:11 AM - Darren: 4. She knew Collin was drunk and is actually a rapist, matt?
10/12/18, 12:11 AM - Ricky: Maybe that’s why she is going to therapy
10/12/18, 12:11 AM - Matt Casali: Nah, she just took advantage of him
10/12/18, 12:11 AM - Tim Ko: Collin how are u feeling in all this
10/12/18, 12:12 AM - Ricky: Too many times she has broken up with a boy and utilized that the take advantage of a drunk dude
10/12/18, 12:12 AM - Matt Casali: wait wait wait
10/12/18, 12:12 AM - Darren: Yeah, roll that back real quick
10/12/18, 12:12 AM - Matt Casali: Sorry, Im putting words out there that aren't mine to say
10/12/18, 12:12 AM - Matt Casali: Collin knows how he feels about it
10/12/18, 12:12 AM - Collin Hurst: I'm fine I just want her to tell me what's up
10/12/18, 12:14 AM - Ricky: It ALL COMES BACK TO TIMS MEME
10/12/18, 12:14 AM - Tim Ko: LOL
10/12/18, 12:15 AM - Collin Hurst: Gdmi hahaha
10/12/18, 12:18 AM - Ricky: Honestly though Collin, if she is going to therapy and everything, I think you are smart in staying friends and even if she offers, maybe give it some time before you go for it
10/12/18, 12:18 AM - Collin Hurst: I think the therapy with smooth things out
10/12/18, 12:18 AM - Darren: Like, at least a month
10/12/18, 12:18 AM - Ricky: ^
10/12/18, 12:19 AM - Parker: ^^
10/12/18, 12:19 AM - Ricky: Why do you think that
10/12/18, 12:19 AM - Ricky: Hopefully it will
10/12/18, 12:19 AM - Ricky: But it can also just kinda whip things around sometimes haha, but if she says it’s working then yay :D
10/12/18, 12:19 AM - Collin Hurst: cause when she was talking to me she said part of why she doesnt want to be in a relationship is that she doesnt want to feel vulnerable
10/12/18, 12:20 AM - Darren: Unless you _need_ to make an exception for Halloween, which would be understandable
10/12/18, 12:20 AM - Collin Hurst: and that she was spreading out her problems amongst her friends to support her, rather than all on one person
10/12/18, 12:20 AM - Collin Hurst: she said it wouln't be fair to me one person take all of the emotional support needed for her problems? idk its weird
10/12/18, 12:21 AM - Darren: Well, putting all that on one person means you become temporarily dependent on that person
10/12/18, 12:22 AM - Darren: And if you also happen to be fucking them, then that feels a whole lot like a relationship
10/12/18, 12:22 AM - Darren: Which she expressly doesn't want
10/12/18, 12:22 AM - Collin Hurst: kind of
10/12/18, 12:22 AM - Matt Casali: Also, keep in mind that you owe her no obligation to keep yourself available for her
10/12/18, 12:22 AM - Collin Hurst: ^ yeah I have that in mind
10/12/18, 12:24 AM - Tim Ko: U could scare her off from u
10/12/18, 12:25 AM - Tim Ko: Be like, I see us getting married
10/12/18, 12:25 AM - Collin Hurst: Lol that is not needed
10/12/18, 12:26 AM - Collin Hurst: She said that I could be with other girls rn haha
10/12/18, 12:26 AM - Darren: Just let her get to know you more
10/12/18, 12:26 AM - Collin Hurst: oof
10/12/18, 12:27 AM - Tim Ko: Hahahaha oh my
10/12/18, 12:28 AM - Tim Ko: Also in other news, my mom seems to disapprove a little that Julia is not Chinese 😂😂
10/12/18, 12:28 AM - Darren: What is she
10/12/18, 12:28 AM - Tim Ko: Korean
10/12/18, 12:28 AM - Ricky: Oh noooooo

10/12/18, 12:29 AM - Ricky: tim, my great grandparents moved across an ocean so they could legally get married, you got this
10/12/18, 12:29 AM - Tim Ko: She’s like, I was shocked when u said Korean. Wouldn’t u want to date someone ur own race? 😂
10/12/18, 12:29 AM - Tim Ko: 😂
10/12/18, 12:29 AM - Tim Ko: Oh my rlly? Hahahaha
10/12/18, 12:29 AM - Darren: My mom has literally told me how she was surprised Jordan King's dad was a good person despite being korean
10/12/18, 12:29 AM - Tim Ko: Lmaoooo
10/12/18, 12:30 AM - Darren: Asians hate other asians
10/12/18, 12:30 AM - Tim Ko: Wow the Chinese are very bitter
10/12/18, 12:30 AM - Tim Ko: Must be a pride thing tbh
10/12/18, 12:30 AM - Tim Ko: Asians are very prideful
10/12/18, 12:30 AM - Darren: Tho she also hates Chinese men because they are honestly the worst
10/12/18, 12:30 AM - Tim Ko: Lmao

10/12/18, 12:32 AM - Darren: Chinese = peasants in China now
10/12/18, 12:33 AM - Collin Hurst: lol
10/12/18, 12:33 AM - Tim Ko: Ohhh I see
10/12/18, 12:34 AM - Tim Ko: I mean tbh i would prefer someone Chinese but that’s a very minor preference.
10/12/18, 12:35 AM - Collin Hurst: Tim just have Julia whip up some delicious Bulgogi when she meets and then it will be all good
10/12/18, 12:35 AM - Darren: My uncle was very against my cousin dating this white guy until the guy got promoted to be a VP at salesforce
10/12/18, 12:35 AM - Darren: Then all was forgiven
10/12/18, 12:36 AM - Ricky: HAHA
10/12/18, 12:36 AM - Tim Ko: Hahahaha
10/12/18, 12:36 AM - Darren: So if Julia make bank, it's smooth sailing

10/16/18, 10:53 PM - Tim Ko: Wow funny I ask cuz we just had like a pretty deep convo for the past 2 hours
10/16/18, 10:53 PM - Tim Ko: *u ask
10/16/18, 10:54 PM - Tim Ko: I put my arms around her as we walked back lol. Never done it before so felt a little awkward at first
10/16/18, 10:54 PM - Tim Ko: But I think she enjoyed it? Lol
10/16/18, 10:54 PM - Collin Hurst: How's operation hand hold
10/16/18, 10:55 PM - Tim Ko: Lolol haven’t done it yet
10/16/18, 11:36 PM - Darren: Oh yeah she enjoys getting your hand all over her back
10/16/18, 11:39 PM - Tim Ko: I just txted her about it, she prefers hand holding
10/16/18, 11:40 PM - Tim Ko: Gang
10/16/18, 11:42 PM - Darren: Oh

10/16/18, 11:44 PM - Ricky: You’re in tim!
10/16/18, 11:47 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah arm around is hard to do while walking unless its really cold
10/16/18, 11:47 PM - Collin Hurst: im a fan of the arm hug tho
10/16/18, 11:52 PM - Tim Ko: Ooooo I think I’d like that too
10/16/18, 11:52 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah partly why I did it cuz it was actually super cold
10/16/18, 11:54 PM - Darren: If you can give her an arm around, your relationship is at the stage where you can hold her hand
10/16/18, 11:55 PM - Darren: Its gonna feel awkward to do, but you need to just pretend like it isn't weird while you're doing it and eventually you'll get used to it
10/16/18, 11:55 PM - Darren: False bravado is the way to go, tim
10/16/18, 11:55 PM - Collin Hurst: if you can hold her hand, you can probs go ahead and ask her for a blowjob
10/16/18, 11:56 PM - Darren: You shouldn't need to ask tbh
10/16/18, 11:56 PM - Tim Ko: Stfu collin lmao
10/16/18, 11:56 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah its a womans duty
10/16/18, 11:56 PM - Collin Hurst: jkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkj calm down ok jeez jk
10/16/18, 11:57 PM - Tim Ko: If I asked for one she’d break up with me on the spot
10/16/18, 11:57 PM - Darren: It's more like an entrance fee
10/16/18, 11:57 PM - Tim Ko: Mmmm for sure
10/16/18, 11:57 PM - Collin Hurst: daily entry fee to talk to you for the day
10/16/18, 11:58 PM - Parker: lol
10/16/18, 11:58 PM - Darren: Like, kissing someone is the weirdest thing until it's not
10/16/18, 11:59 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah first kiss was weird
10/16/18, 11:59 PM - Parker: kinda true
10/17/18, 12:00 AM - Collin Hurst: it only felt good cause of adrenaline and the symbol behind it not the actual physical part
10/17/18, 12:01 AM - Darren: Especially because the first kiss is always so much tongue since you've got no idea what you're doing
10/17/18, 12:02 AM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah chanti had no idea what she was in for
10/17/18, 12:02 AM - Collin Hurst: my first kiss was no tongue
10/17/18, 12:03 AM - Darren: Wow you classy mother fucker

10/17/18, 12:06 AM - Collin Hurst: idk ya never know what vaughn or jason could pull out of the hat
10/17/18, 12:06 AM - Tim Ko: Or Alex
10/17/18, 12:07 AM - Tim Ko: 3rd grade alex was such a distraction that they banned him from the playground
10/17/18, 12:07 AM - Darren: It wasn't for the bullying?
10/17/18, 12:07 AM - Darren: That was Steven
10/17/18, 12:07 AM - Collin Hurst: distraction because of the albedo?
10/17/18, 12:09 AM - Tim Ko: Oh yeah Steven made them wet in their eyes

10/30/18, 2:31 AM - Collin Hurst: So essentially Id been having a lot of sex with Maya for a week or two, and then she tells me that she's getting too attached to me and that I'm too good of boyfriend material and that she needs to be single rn so we shouldn't do anything
10/30/18, 2:32 AM - Collin Hurst: So I'm like alright sounds ok, something like that is easy to brush off especially when you weren't expecting much in the first place
10/30/18, 2:32 AM - Collin Hurst: But harder to brush off when you hear another guy in her room at 2am smh
10/30/18, 2:33 AM - Collin Hurst: And I know him too es em aych man
10/30/18, 2:34 AM - Jason Greenberg: Holy fuck

10/30/18, 2:35 AM - Collin Hurst: It's funny too cause I knew it was gonna happen
10/30/18, 2:35 AM - Jason Greenberg: Thats the fuckin worst
10/30/18, 2:35 AM - Collin Hurst: With him
10/30/18, 2:35 AM - Collin Hurst: At least he's soft
10/30/18, 2:36 AM - Collin Hurst: It would suck more if he was intimidating but it's ok
10/30/18, 2:37 AM - Darren: Ew
10/30/18, 2:37 AM - Collin Hurst: ES EM AYCH
10/30/18, 2:37 AM - Jason Greenberg: Maybe but yeah that fuckin sucks
10/30/18, 2:37 AM - Darren: He may be soft, but he probably doesn't say stuff like this so he's better by default
10/30/18, 2:38 AM - Collin Hurst: How do you know he doesn't lol
10/30/18, 2:39 AM - Collin Hurst: I haven't gotten my condoms back from her room

10/30/18, 9:08 AM - Ricky: if only you had a rule at the beginning of the year that would prevent you from constantly walking by the room of someone you are being casual with, like not being their neighbor, or even on the same floor as them
10/30/18, 9:08 AM - Ricky: sry too soon
10/30/18, 9:08 AM - Ricky: either way, you gotta drop this chick

10/30/18, 9:12 AM - Jason Greenberg: On the plus side you have a lot of sex doing it
10/30/18, 9:12 AM - Alex Starr: Or rather it’s better than the likely alternative
10/30/18, 9:13 AM - Jason Greenberg: I'm exaggerating but our boy was doing well is all I'm saying
10/30/18, 9:14 AM - Alex Starr: Something tells me it isn’t too far from accurate
10/30/18, 9:17 AM - Jason Greenberg: I just think less limits within reason is the best start and narrow your prospects from there is the best move. Collin you a peacock dont be afraid to fly
10/30/18, 9:18 AM - Alex Starr: Or without reason
10/30/18, 9:18 AM - Alex Starr: You don’t owe logic a thing
10/30/18, 9:19 AM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
10/30/18, 9:20 AM - Collin Hurst: Lol yeah I thought I could handle anything but wasn't really ready for that lol

11/1/18, 1:17 AM - Ricky: So I’m glad at least you have an answer and it’s done with
11/1/18, 5:20 AM - Jason Greenberg: I'm sorry parky
11/1/18, 5:25 AM - Jason Greenberg: At least you can slowly move on now
11/1/18, 8:42 AM - Tim Ko: ^
11/1/18, 8:46 AM - Parker: this is fucken hard
11/1/18, 8:54 AM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah
11/1/18, 8:54 AM - Jason Greenberg: Exercise and writing about it or talking about it are the best ways for me to get over someone
11/1/18, 8:56 AM - Jason Greenberg: It's ok to be upset tho, it can take a while to get over someone. It took me like a month to get over kelsey
11/1/18, 8:57 AM - Jason Greenberg: All you can really do is give yourself time because it might not seem like it now, but it will slowly get a little better every day and a few months from now you'll be about to look back on this and really feel over this girl
11/1/18, 9:03 AM - Matt Casali: ^
11/1/18, 9:33 AM - Parker: yeah i know it’ll get better
11/1/18, 9:33 AM - Parker: the hard thing though is that we’re friends so i see her almost everyday
11/1/18, 9:33 AM - Parker: so it’s like a constant reminder
11/1/18, 9:34 AM - Parker: I also haven’t said anything about this but do you think i should ask about like fwb? bc i don’t really know how she feels about that/what that entails
11/1/18, 9:34 AM - Matt Casali: I think that would not be a good idea
11/1/18, 9:34 AM - Matt Casali: For your sake
11/1/18, 9:34 AM - Matt Casali: Like a very not good, stay-away idea
11/1/18, 9:35 AM - Alex Starr: Double ungood
11/1/18, 9:43 AM - Parker: i can see why you say that but i also don’t think it’d be as bad as you think
11/1/18, 9:43 AM - Parker: because as much i’ve denied it and wanted to deny it, i’ve known for awhile that a relationship might not be the best for her and i
11/1/18, 9:46 AM - Alex Starr: Always look on the bright side of life
11/1/18, 9:48 AM - Matt Casali: Famous last words
11/1/18, 9:53 AM - Alex Starr: Right up there with “I like those odds” and “what’s the worst that could happen”
11/1/18, 9:53 AM - Jason Greenberg: God no
11/1/18, 9:55 AM - Alex Starr: I like the bluntness
11/1/18, 9:58 AM - Parker: whatever nvm
11/1/18, 10:53 AM - Matt Casali: :( just give yourself some space man
11/1/18, 11:19 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah I agree with others cuz like u are still emotionally attatched so some space would be the best for u
11/1/18, 11:19 AM - Tim Ko: I’m sorry about this parker :(
11/1/18, 11:20 AM - Tim Ko: Would u wanna google hangout with us sometime?
11/1/18, 11:32 AM - Parker: i’m pretty busy but possibly
11/1/18, 11:41 AM - Tim Ko: Aight just let us know whenever u  feel like it
11/1/18, 11:42 AM - Tim Ko: Hang in there man
11/1/18, 11:43 AM - Tim Ko: Just remember, the warriors lost to the cavs in the finals, was a historical choke job and devastating, felt like a lost year. But in the end they got KD and won back to back.
11/1/18, 11:43 AM - Darren: Or don't
11/1/18, 11:44 AM - Tim Ko: U are the warriors parker
11/11/18, 12:59 PM - Collin Hurst: this girl is cute but Im starting to think that she actually has nothing to say rather than just being quiet
11/11/18, 12:59 PM - Collin Hurst: which is unfortunate
11/11/18, 12:59 PM - Matt Casali: She was talkative yesterday
11/11/18, 1:00 PM - Collin Hurst: eh
11/11/18, 1:00 PM - Collin Hurst: do you mean sophie lol
11/11/18, 1:00 PM - Matt Casali: No Hayley
11/11/18, 1:00 PM - Collin Hurst: hm
11/11/18, 1:00 PM - Collin Hurst: maybe in a group setting
11/11/18, 1:01 PM - Matt Casali: How long have you known her?
11/11/18, 1:01 PM - Collin Hurst: a week
11/11/18, 1:02 PM - Collin Hurst: Im just getting the feeling, not saying its true tho
11/11/18, 1:02 PM - Matt Casali: Well she may open up as you get to know her more
11/11/18, 1:02 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah
11/11/18, 1:02 PM - Darren: They usually do
11/11/18, 1:03 PM - Matt Casali: Usually
11/11/18, 1:03 PM - Collin Hurst: r u thinking what im thinking
11/11/18, 1:03 PM - Matt Casali: She could just never talk to you
11/11/18, 1:03 PM - Collin Hurst: why
11/11/18, 1:04 PM - Collin Hurst: do you say that
11/11/18, 1:04 PM - Matt Casali: Maybe she has nothing to say
11/11/18, 1:05 PM - Collin Hurst: to me specifically or in general lol
11/11/18, 1:05 PM - Darren: They usually do, *;)*
11/11/18, 1:06 PM - Collin Hurst: ah you are thinking what im thinking hehe
11/11/18, 1:08 PM - Vaughn: Hehehe
11/11/18, 1:08 PM - Collin Hurst: tee hee
11/11/18, 1:08 PM - Vaughn: 🙊
11/11/18, 5:19 PM - Jason Greenberg: I'm with ya coll ;)
11/11/18, 5:48 PM - Tim Ko: U should ask her about it
11/11/18, 5:49 PM - Darren: "hey, why are you a mute?"
11/11/18, 5:50 PM - Darren: Goes well every time
11/11/18, 5:51 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
11/11/18, 5:51 PM - Tim Ko: You will never know the answer unless u ask her
11/11/18, 6:13 PM - Alex Starr: Especially if she is a mute
11/11/18, 6:16 PM - Parker: ^
11/11/18, 6:16 PM - Darren: *Talk, dammit!*
11/11/18, 7:15 PM - Alex Starr: Honestly a mute is better than the alternative
11/11/18, 7:17 PM - Darren: Is the alternative someone who has the ability to speak?
11/11/18, 7:18 PM - Parker: hahaha
11/11/18, 7:30 PM - Ricky: Hahaha
11/11/18, 7:33 PM - Alex Starr: Never stops talking
11/11/18, 7:33 PM - Alex Starr: But maybe
11/11/18, 7:37 PM - Darren: Alex prefers his women taciturn, his relationships laconic, and description about them sesquipedalian
11/11/18, 7:42 PM - Alex Starr: And I’m the one who uses big words
11/11/18, 7:46 PM - Alex Starr: Tho I did not know what sesquipedalian means.  Cool to learn a new word
11/11/18, 8:25 PM - Tim Ko: 😂
11/12/18, 12:34 AM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha
11/12/18, 12:35 AM - Jason Greenberg: Come on with that word man
11/12/18, 2:46 AM - Jason Greenberg: Omg i looked it up
11/12/18, 7:59 PM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
11/12/18, 7:59 PM - Collin Hurst: Probs the most scandy thing I've done
11/12/18, 7:59 PM - Matt Casali: Is that a screenshot of a video?
11/12/18, 7:59 PM - Vaughn: Show the pic rohan took
11/12/18, 8:00 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah
11/12/18, 8:00 PM - Collin Hurst: I don't have it
11/12/18, 8:22 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
11/12/18, 8:22 PM - Collin Hurst: What
11/12/18, 8:23 PM - Collin Hurst: Some good Cheetos there bud?
11/12/18, 8:23 PM - Matt Casali: Nope
11/12/18, 8:24 PM - Collin Hurst: K cool?
11/12/18, 8:24 PM - Vaughn: <Media omitted>
11/12/18, 8:25 PM - Vaughn: Same matt
11/12/18, 8:26 PM - Matt Casali: If you kno you kno
11/12/18, 8:27 PM - Collin Hurst: Idk what that is supposed to be
11/12/18, 8:27 PM - Matt Casali: And if you dont, you dont
11/12/18, 8:28 PM - Collin Hurst: Alright I hope it has something to do with sex and reltionships bud
11/12/18, 8:33 PM - Tim Ko: y tho
11/12/18, 8:34 PM - Tim Ko: Pls no more of those pics
11/12/18, 8:36 PM - Alex Starr: What is it a picture of?
11/12/18, 8:41 PM - Alex Starr: Other than someone’s knee
11/12/18, 8:48 PM - Vaughn: Just ucsc things
11/12/18, 8:49 PM - Alex Starr: Pretty sure other colleges have people with knees
11/12/18, 8:56 PM - Collin Hurst: What are those pics supposed to be other than stupid and irrelevant
11/12/18, 8:56 PM - Darren: I'm confused at everything
11/12/18, 8:56 PM - Alex Starr: I’m asking what your picture is collin
11/12/18, 8:57 PM - Darren: But I can endorse this message
11/12/18, 8:57 PM - Alex Starr: Other than strangely knee centric
11/12/18, 8:58 PM - Collin Hurst: I hooked up with Hayley while rohan was hooking up with her roommate on the bunk across from me
11/12/18, 8:59 PM - Vaughn: THEY MADE EYE CONTACT 4 TIMES
11/12/18, 8:59 PM - Alex Starr: Collin and Hayley?
11/12/18, 8:59 PM - Alex Starr: I suppose that’s close to her speaking
11/12/18, 9:01 PM - Darren: Oh, that photo didn't make that immediately clear
11/12/18, 9:01 PM - Darren: Thats wild, for lack of a better term
11/12/18, 9:02 PM - Alex Starr: It made it completely unclear
11/12/18, 9:02 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah pretty nutty
11/12/18, 9:04 PM - Alex Starr: The real question is whether Tim was that offended by collin showing off so much knee or somehow inferred what actually happened
11/12/18, 9:06 PM - Collin Hurst: Was Tim offended by the knee or the Cheeto fingers
11/12/18, 9:06 PM - Alex Starr: That’s another possibility ur right
11/12/18, 9:07 PM - Matt Casali: *Period fingers
11/12/18, 9:08 PM - Collin Hurst: Poorly faked image
11/12/18, 9:08 PM - Collin Hurst: 3/10
11/12/18, 9:08 PM - Alex Starr: We were trying to ignore it
11/12/18, 9:14 PM - Alex Starr: So which was it tim?
11/12/18, 9:16 PM - Darren: Why the fuck did you send that picture
11/12/18, 9:16 PM - Darren: Fuck
11/12/18, 9:16 PM - Alex Starr: Which picture
11/12/18, 9:16 PM - Alex Starr: This is the most ambiguous conversation
11/12/18, 9:20 PM - Vaughn: <Media omitted>
11/12/18, 9:20 PM - Alex Starr: No
11/12/18, 9:20 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t think that helps anyone
11/12/18, 9:20 PM - Alex Starr: Scratch that, anyone but Tim
11/12/18, 9:24 PM - Darren: You all need jesus
11/12/18, 9:24 PM - Alex Starr: _posts picture of naked Christ_
11/12/18, 9:45 PM - Tim Ko: All of em
11/12/18, 9:46 PM - Alex Starr: Damn collin better not wear shorts around you then
11/12/18, 10:09 PM - Parker: that picture explained nothing hahah
11/12/18, 10:09 PM - Ricky: ^
11/12/18, 10:12 PM - Collin Hurst: Dangit haha
11/22/18, 11:51 PM - Parker: this(and i assume you guys know what this is) really isn’t getting any easier
11/22/18, 11:52 PM - Parker: i hate to be the debby downer on this lovely holiday but just wanted to put that out there
11/22/18, 11:52 PM - Vaughn: Just 9 more days bro we can do it
11/22/18, 11:52 PM - Tim Ko: Aww I’m sorry man :((
11/22/18, 11:53 PM - Collin Hurst: Aw man :(
11/22/18, 11:53 PM - Tim Ko: Don’t worry man, feel free to talk about it whenever I want
11/22/18, 11:53 PM - Tim Ko: *u
11/22/18, 11:53 PM - Tim Ko: We are always here to support u
11/22/18, 11:54 PM - Darren: What is happening?
11/22/18, 11:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: We're gonna chum it up good this break pman
11/22/18, 11:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hang in there
11/22/18, 11:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: What are you thinking about?
11/22/18, 11:56 PM - Parker: i know thank you love you all
11/22/18, 11:57 PM - Parker: idk lots of things i just can’t seem to get my mind off of it permanently, thinking about what i could’ve done differently
11/22/18, 11:57 PM - Parker: wish i could do a lot of it over again
11/22/18, 11:59 PM - Darren: To quote the late Alex starr, I'm confused
11/22/18, 11:59 PM - Parker: i w been reading old messages here and elsewhere too and just regret a lot idk
11/22/18, 11:59 PM - Collin Hurst: Idk how to say this but I was kinda in your position before, and I think that's it's best to think that if you have to be so perfect and careful with your words/actions around someone to get them to do something then it's not meant to be
11/23/18, 12:00 AM - Collin Hurst: As long as you were being yourself there's not much you can regret imo
11/23/18, 12:00 AM - Darren: Is there anything in particular that happened? Or just feeling it more than ever?
11/23/18, 12:00 AM - Parker: I don’t think that’s what i mean exactly collin but i get that
11/23/18, 12:01 AM - Parker: not in the last couple weeks no but idk it’s just on my mind a lot
11/23/18, 12:01 AM - Parker: and always seem to come back to it no matter what
11/23/18, 12:02 AM - Vaughn: I like that
11/23/18, 12:02 AM - Tim Ko: Oooo this is really good
11/23/18, 12:02 AM - Tim Ko: Preach brother
11/23/18, 12:02 AM - Parker: i agree 100%
11/23/18, 12:03 AM - Parker: but not what i mean really
11/23/18, 12:03 AM - Tim Ko: Hmm what specifically do u regret?
11/23/18, 12:03 AM - Matt Casali: It'll probably help you and all of us to try to explain more
11/23/18, 12:03 AM - Matt Casali: Just stream-of-consciousness it
11/23/18, 12:05 AM - Parker: maybe regret isn’t the right word in this exact moment but i’m just thinking about all the stuff from the beginning of summer that i told u guys about(part of the reason she wasn’t about it anymore) which i guess is regret
11/23/18, 12:05 AM - Parker: bc she said that to me
11/23/18, 12:06 AM - Parker: which like i’ve felt shitty about every single day since that happened
11/23/18, 12:06 AM - Parker: also i know i never made much of a physical move which no matter what you guys or she says, i know that played into it
11/23/18, 12:06 AM - Parker: and that’s not to make her sound shallow or anything
11/23/18, 12:07 AM - Parker: but i know she wanted it at one point and i didn’t do anything
11/23/18, 12:08 AM - Parker: it was also just a weird situation to be in with her being gone and i just read a message from collin from june about making a strong bond before she leaves or else i’ll be kicking myself all summer
11/23/18, 12:08 AM - Parker: which happened
11/23/18, 12:08 AM - Parker: or didn’t happen i guess
11/23/18, 12:09 AM - Matt Casali: I first wanna say that reading through messages is a no go
11/23/18, 12:09 AM - Parker: which set myself up for failure bc i was basically waiting all summer
11/23/18, 12:09 AM - Parker: for this
11/23/18, 12:09 AM - Parker: i know matt but sad boy gonna sad boy
11/23/18, 12:10 AM - Matt Casali: I dont want you to feel like you need to hurt yourself
11/23/18, 12:10 AM - Matt Casali: If you think about it, why do you feel like you wanna go back into those messages
11/23/18, 12:10 AM - Parker: ok that comes off a lot harsher than intended
11/23/18, 12:10 AM - Parker: i am okay
11/23/18, 12:10 AM - Parker: just sad
11/23/18, 12:11 AM - Parker: bc i’m wishing things could be different
11/23/18, 12:11 AM - Tim Ko: Do u think ur a little better than a couple weeks ago?
11/23/18, 12:12 AM - Parker: it really ebbs and flows
11/23/18, 12:13 AM - Tim Ko: I see
11/23/18, 12:13 AM - Matt Casali: Point is: if you wanna begin to dig yourself out of this hole you cant intentionally do things that you know are gonna make you feel bad
11/23/18, 12:13 AM - Tim Ko: I think how ur feeling is normal
11/23/18, 12:14 AM - Darren: Well, you can do that and dig yourself out
11/23/18, 12:14 AM - Darren: But it makes it harder
11/23/18, 12:14 AM - Parker: I know matt...
11/23/18, 12:15 AM - Parker: you’re not saying anything i don’t know or haven’t been told by other people
11/23/18, 12:15 AM - Tim Ko: But I think at some point ur gonna have to stop dwelling on regretting
11/23/18, 12:15 AM - Matt Casali: But you still looked at the messages
11/23/18, 12:15 AM - Tim Ko: Would a personal story help parker?
11/23/18, 12:15 AM - Matt Casali: So I guess I'm wondering what's making you look at the messages?
11/23/18, 12:16 AM - Tim Ko: I’ve had my time of regrets with things like this
11/23/18, 12:16 AM - Parker: Idk if it’s just the regret but sure
11/23/18, 12:16 AM - Parker: because when i’m sad i so sad things matt i don’t really know
11/23/18, 12:17 AM - Parker: and i know it’s not a solution but it’s just what i do i guess
11/23/18, 12:17 AM - Parker: do*
11/23/18, 12:17 AM - Darren: Self pity sad boy train can be a positive experience. Ricky commented a couple months ago about how just experiencing pure emotions is a pretty novel thing
11/23/18, 12:17 AM - Matt Casali: Sure
11/23/18, 12:18 AM - Matt Casali: But doing shrooms is cool and can be a good experience
11/23/18, 12:18 AM - Collin Hurst: I don't see a problem with looking at messages
11/23/18, 12:18 AM - Matt Casali: But doing shrooms for a month straight?
11/23/18, 12:18 AM - Matt Casali: Idk man seems like a rough time
11/23/18, 12:18 AM - Darren: That's a stretch and you know it
11/23/18, 12:18 AM - Matt Casali: Hahah
11/23/18, 12:19 AM - Collin Hurst: If you can't face and learn from the past how are you going to improve ?
11/23/18, 12:19 AM - Matt Casali: I think a healthy thing to do would be to find happy things to do when you're sad
11/23/18, 12:19 AM - Matt Casali: Don't ignore the feelings, just dont let them control you
11/23/18, 12:19 AM - Parker: yeah kinda how i feel and idk i haven’t felt this before so i think i’ll just stay in my feelingns for a little lol
11/23/18, 12:19 AM - Parker: i got drake what more could i need
11/23/18, 12:19 AM - Collin Hurst: Gotta be real with it
11/23/18, 12:20 AM - Darren: Wait
11/23/18, 12:20 AM - Collin Hurst: Kiki
11/23/18, 12:20 AM - Parker: sadness is an important emotion to recognize
11/23/18, 12:20 AM - Matt Casali: Recognize it
11/23/18, 12:20 AM - Matt Casali: Dont let it control you
11/23/18, 12:20 AM - Parker: <Media omitted>
11/23/18, 12:20 AM - Matt Casali: Those are easy to mix up
11/23/18, 12:20 AM - Darren: I don't think that's the issue here
11/23/18, 12:20 AM - Matt Casali: Seems like it to me
11/23/18, 12:21 AM - Matt Casali: But I also dont have all the facts
11/23/18, 12:21 AM - Parker: i agree but kinda hard when midterms and finals are leaving your anus gaping
11/23/18, 12:21 AM - Parker: but getting away to see fam is definitely a positive
11/23/18, 12:21 AM - Matt Casali: Not impossible
11/23/18, 12:21 AM - Matt Casali: See?
11/23/18, 12:21 AM - Darren: parker: listen to this song and their albums on Spotify https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9nJ6QytFU
11/23/18, 12:21 AM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
11/23/18, 12:21 AM - Darren: good sad boy bangers
11/23/18, 12:21 AM - Parker: Ooooo
11/23/18, 12:21 AM - Collin Hurst: Joji is King of sad boi idc what anyone else says
11/23/18, 12:22 AM - Parker: honestly for a couple weeks there it was nearly impossible
11/23/18, 12:22 AM - Parker: i disagree
11/23/18, 12:22 AM - Parker: all i need is drake, frank ocean, and daniel caesar
11/23/18, 12:22 AM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
11/23/18, 12:22 AM - Parker: i wouldn’t say it’s controlling me by any stretch
11/23/18, 12:23 AM - Darren: Parker seems to be doing fine
11/23/18, 12:23 AM - Parker: there’s a lot in my life that i don’t share every detail of
11/23/18, 12:23 AM - Parker: i just wanted to share my sad boy stuff here
11/23/18, 12:23 AM - Darren: He's at a low point but he's dealing with it well enough. Shit sucks, but it's hard for everyone
11/23/18, 12:24 AM - Matt Casali: Reading through messages just seems to me like stressing while replaying past conversations in your head
11/23/18, 12:24 AM - Matt Casali: Which is not a good thing
11/23/18, 12:24 AM - Tim Ko: It’s just a matter of time parker
11/23/18, 12:24 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah parker, I'm sorry that you're going through this
11/23/18, 12:24 AM - Matt Casali: I have full faith that you'll be better
11/23/18, 12:24 AM - Matt Casali: I'm just trying to give you tools that have helped me
11/23/18, 12:24 AM - Tim Ko: I know it’s hard but with time, you’ll slowly get better
11/23/18, 12:25 AM - Parker: it was also kinda unique bc we were never dating despite it going on for so long
11/23/18, 12:25 AM - Parker: so it’s a lot of what could’ve been
11/23/18, 12:25 AM - Matt Casali: Limbo sucks
11/23/18, 12:25 AM - Parker: yeah no i get that i appreciate matt
11/23/18, 12:25 AM - Parker: it*
11/23/18, 12:25 AM - Parker: and you
11/23/18, 12:26 AM - Parker: which is where the “regret” comes from i guess
11/23/18, 12:29 AM - Tim Ko: Parker also try looking forward, like trysten is a thing of the past, acknowledge what happenned and what u learned and think of the possibilities u have now and in the future
11/23/18, 12:29 AM - Parker: a thing of the past and you still can’t get the spelling lmao
11/23/18, 12:30 AM - Parker: also the other thing is we were good friends before it and still are after it so that doesn’t help either
11/23/18, 12:30 AM - Parker: bc we still care about each other it’s just she doesn’t want anything more than friendship anymore
11/23/18, 12:31 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah that definately makes it more tough
11/23/18, 12:31 AM - Tim Ko: I’ll pray for u parker
11/23/18, 12:31 AM - Tim Ko: Even if that doesn’t mean anything to u
11/23/18, 12:31 AM - Tim Ko: :)

11/23/18, 12:47 AM - Parker: sad clips or sad boy clips?

11/23/18, 11:44 AM - Parker: have fun!
11/26/18, 9:17 AM - Tim Ko: I have a question
11/26/18, 9:19 AM - Matt Casali: The clitoris is at the crest of the labia
11/26/18, 9:20 AM - Parker: Lol
11/26/18, 9:23 AM - Vaughn: Hahaha
11/26/18, 9:23 AM - Tim Ko: So it’s been a almost a couple months now and Julia’s mostly been great but the thing is she never really asks me to hang out. I’m the one always asking her. When I ask her she always says yes tho. She’s usually with her friends and such and so socially she’s always occupied. However, yesterday I wanted to see her since it was first day after break so I asked her to hang out, she initially said she wasn’t sure what she’d be doing and that she would let me know. Then I told her that since she’s busy, we could just go for like a 30 min walk or something. She agreed and told me to txt her when I got back to Berkeley. I got back and I txted her and then she said that she had a meeting she forgot about (which she actually did) but that she would not be free at all to hang out. She was with her friends for pretty much ALL of the day, except for her meeting. It kinda made me upset that she didn’t even have 30 mins out of her day to spend time with me while she was with her friends the whole day. Idk I feel like from now on maybe I should not ask her to hang out and see if then she asks me
11/26/18, 9:23 AM - Tim Ko: Good idea?
11/26/18, 9:24 AM - Alex Starr: Is it that important that she asks you to hang out?
11/26/18, 9:25 AM - Tim Ko: Not exactly, more of that she makes time for me rather than I’m just the 5th option lol
11/26/18, 9:25 AM - Parker: i think he’s getting at her making time for him alex
11/26/18, 9:25 AM - Parker: not that she asks him
11/26/18, 9:26 AM - Tim Ko: I was thinking maybe going for a week without initiating anything
11/26/18, 9:26 AM - Parker: if you wanna hangout with her, which u should, i wouldn’t stop asking her
11/26/18, 9:26 AM - Parker: but that’s just me
11/26/18, 9:26 AM - Alex Starr: Seems extremely passive aggressive
11/26/18, 9:26 AM - Tim Ko: Lol it is hahaha
11/26/18, 9:27 AM - Parker: ^^
11/26/18, 9:27 AM - Tim Ko: Ok maybe I’m just being silly haha
11/26/18, 9:28 AM - Tim Ko: Maybe I just need to lower my effort level to match hers
11/26/18, 9:28 AM - Alex Starr: That seems like a bad idea
11/26/18, 9:29 AM - Parker: i wouldn’t do that
11/26/18, 9:30 AM - Tim Ko: I mean it sucks just putting in so much and making her a big priority when it seems like I am not that important to her
11/26/18, 9:31 AM - Alex Starr: Some relationships maybe most are unequal
11/26/18, 9:32 AM - Parker: ^
11/26/18, 9:32 AM - Parker: that was just like my situation tim minus the dating part
11/26/18, 9:33 AM - Alex Starr: If that’s unacceptable and you can’t think of a reason why her level of investment would increase in the future, you should consider communicating about it with her.  Otherwise, just keep putting in whatever effort is most enjoyable for you
11/26/18, 9:33 AM - Tim Ko: For sure
11/26/18, 9:34 AM - Alex Starr: But don’t do anything passive aggressive like stop going out with her
11/26/18, 9:34 AM - Alex Starr: Either communicate, accept it, or deal with it
11/26/18, 9:35 AM - Tim Ko: Mmm yeah I agree
11/26/18, 9:35 AM - Tim Ko: Thx
11/26/18, 9:35 AM - Parker: ^
11/26/18, 9:35 AM - Parker: bc that’s not healthy
11/26/18, 9:36 AM - Parker: i agree with all of that
11/26/18, 9:47 AM - Jason Greenberg: Dude just bring it up to her
11/26/18, 9:47 AM - Jason Greenberg: Dont accept it
11/26/18, 9:48 AM - Vaughn: Send this to her ^
11/26/18, 9:48 AM - Alex Starr: All I’m saying with the accept it thing is that there may be other temporary factors causing her to be busy
11/26/18, 9:48 AM - Vaughn: ^ true
11/26/18, 9:49 AM - Jason Greenberg: Be like i feel that i am the main person initiating our hangouts and the lack of you asking me to see each other makes me feel not so wanted
11/26/18, 9:53 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah it’s not a one time thing, I’ve kinda brought it up to her before already but I think I’ll do it again today
11/26/18, 9:53 AM - Tim Ko: Thx guys ❤
11/26/18, 9:53 AM - Alex Starr: Do so tactfully
11/26/18, 9:54 AM - Tim Ko: Yeah for sure haha
11/26/18, 9:57 AM - Jason Greenberg: Love you bud you got this
11/26/18, 9:57 AM - Matt Casali: ^
11/26/18, 10:07 AM - Parker: better to be confrontational
11/26/18, 10:07 AM - Matt Casali: I think you mean upfront haha
11/26/18, 10:07 AM - Parker: yeah whatever
11/26/18, 10:07 AM - Parker: better than leaving things unsaid
11/26/18, 10:07 AM - Parker: let me tell you that much lol
11/26/18, 10:08 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah I only said that cause the two have pretty different connotations
11/26/18, 10:08 AM - Darren: Just fight her
11/26/18, 10:09 AM - Darren: When you exchange fists, there's nothing but truth
11/26/18, 10:09 AM - Tim Ko: Lol
11/26/18, 10:10 AM - Alex Starr: Phrasing
11/26/18, 10:16 AM - Ricky: I like how we handled this, ricky approves this message :)
11/26/18, 10:26 AM - Collin Hurst: Same 👍
11/26/18, 10:36 AM - Jason Greenberg: Hahahaha
11/27/18, 12:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: Any updates timo?
11/27/18, 12:57 PM - Vaughn: *^*
11/27/18, 1:13 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah, I’m tutoring rn but I’ll let u know when I’m done
11/27/18, 1:14 PM - Alex Starr: Tutoring is the best time to let us know
11/27/18, 1:48 PM - Tim Ko: So I brought it up to her about priorities and commitment and spending time with me and she said that she spends a lot of time with her friends because she’s just more comfortable with her friends and that’s she wishes she could commit more to spending time with me and prioritize me more. She said that is because she is more comfortable with familiarity. So I suggested that we have a date night every week where we dedicate a few hours to each other once a week. And she said that she liked that idea
11/27/18, 1:48 PM - Tim Ko: What do u guys think of what she said
11/27/18, 1:57 PM - Tim Ko: I welcome all opinions and pls be brutally honest with me
11/27/18, 2:00 PM - Ricky: Idk, everyone is different and I definately like comfort but I just feel setting a once a week expectation thing is scary, because it puts all of your excitement and hopes into one timeframe so if for some reason she or you can’t do it, even if it completely valid excuse, it will feel like a knife to the heart, or like a sever betrayal disputes the person missing it having no Intention Of that
11/27/18, 2:01 PM - Ricky: Idk if that makes sense, I can elaborate more if ya want :)
11/27/18, 2:03 PM - Alex Starr: Do her
11/27/18, 2:03 PM - Tim Ko: Hmmm yeah I can see that ricky
11/27/18, 2:04 PM - Tim Ko: I guess the reason I set that was cuz it’s important to me that she sets intentional time to be with me since she is usually busy with her friends
11/27/18, 2:05 PM - Tim Ko: I told her that we can see each other more if we want, but I just want at least once a week that she sets apart for me
11/27/18, 2:05 PM - Tim Ko: Also if for some reason that day doesn’t work, we can always reschedule
11/27/18, 2:06 PM - Tim Ko: Also what do u guys think about the priority and commitment stuff about me
11/27/18, 2:06 PM - Tim Ko: *she said regarding me
11/27/18, 2:06 PM - Alex Starr: That’s why I said do her
11/27/18, 2:07 PM - Tim Ko: Like should I just be patient with that?
11/27/18, 2:07 PM - Tim Ko: And hope maybe as we date longer she will be more committed to me?
11/27/18, 2:24 PM - Tim Ko: Thoughts? Just tell me what u think no matter how bad it may be
11/27/18, 2:42 PM - Vaughn: I think you took a step in a right direction
11/27/18, 2:43 PM - Vaughn: You got an honest answer from you and it seems she wants to fix the issue with you
11/27/18, 2:43 PM - Vaughn: *from her
11/27/18, 3:02 PM - Tim Ko: Mmm ok for sure
11/27/18, 3:02 PM - Tim Ko: Thanks
11/27/18, 3:06 PM - Parker: i agree with this
11/27/18, 3:07 PM - Parker: it sets you up for being more hurt if for some reason she can’t make that time
11/27/18, 3:08 PM - Parker: i also don’t think you should be content with only guaranteeing you see her once a week but that’s just me, i’d say maybe figure out when she is free during the week beforehand and do the best you can to see her when she’s free
11/27/18, 3:12 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah well if she can’t even do once a week then idk if this is best for me lol
11/27/18, 3:12 PM - Tim Ko: I think I’m just lowering my expectations
11/27/18, 3:12 PM - Parker: yeah and i’ll add that if that’s too much for her or you just can’t really see her that often it might not be the best for you
11/27/18, 3:13 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah for sure
11/27/18, 3:13 PM - Tim Ko: I’ve thought about this
11/27/18, 3:13 PM - Parker: bc you don’t have to necessarily be her first priority but you should be a priority to some degree
11/27/18, 3:13 PM - Tim Ko: But i think I’ll be patient about it
11/27/18, 3:13 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah for sure
11/27/18, 3:13 PM - Parker: maybe see how it goes for a couple weeks or so and talk about it again of nothing changes
11/27/18, 3:13 PM - Parker: if*
11/27/18, 3:14 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah that sounds good
11/27/18, 3:14 PM - Tim Ko: Thx!
11/27/18, 3:59 PM - Parker: yeah good luck i hope it works out
11/27/18, 4:38 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah thanks!
11/28/18, 2:25 AM - Jason Greenberg: Im with vaughn. If you felt like she was receptive to your concerns thats whats important and I would try out this once a week thing and see how it goes. It doesnt have to be the only time you spend together obvi but me and hayley have a set lunch date on wednesdays here and its great

11/30/18, 1:00 PM - Tim Ko: Was only like 2 months so not that deep
11/30/18, 1:06 PM - Matt Casali: That's good, best not to dwell on it
11/30/18, 1:09 PM - Parker: what did she say for why?
11/30/18, 1:09 PM - Parker: just not enough time?
11/30/18, 1:09 PM - Tim Ko: She said she didn’t see a future with me
11/30/18, 1:10 PM - Tim Ko: And said that she thought or relationship was burdensome
11/30/18, 1:10 PM - Tim Ko: And said it wasn’t healthy for her
11/30/18, 1:10 PM - Tim Ko: I think she just stopped liking me as much I guess
11/30/18, 1:10 PM - Tim Ko: Can I call some of u guys

12/1/18, 5:50 PM - Tim Ko: Was just wondering what ur all experiences was like in terms of completely moving on and how long it took and when u stopped missing ur ex and what advice u all have

12/1/18, 5:50 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah im sure it did
12/1/18, 5:51 PM - Collin Hurst: I think for me it was just good to realize what happened and just let yourself feel like the website said lol
12/1/18, 5:52 PM - Tim Ko: Haha mmm for sure
12/1/18, 5:58 PM - Collin Hurst: Other than that time helps

12/1/18, 6:33 PM - Parker: ^
12/1/18, 6:35 PM - Alex Starr: And besides in 10 years, I’m sure you’ll remember her name about as well as I do
12/1/18, 6:36 PM - Alex Starr: Tho that’s not all that happy a thought
12/1/18, 6:36 PM - Parker: or they reunite at some church 15 years from now and end up getting married
12/1/18, 6:37 PM - Parker: only two possibilities
12/1/18, 6:37 PM - Alex Starr: Nah
12/1/18, 6:37 PM - Alex Starr: Sex change operation
12/1/18, 6:38 PM - Parker: you say that like it would stop them from getting back together
12/1/18, 6:38 PM - Alex Starr: I don’t think she’d date a post op tranny
12/1/18, 6:39 PM - Alex Starr: To put it as politically incorrect as I can with limited effort
12/1/18, 8:05 PM - Tim Ko: Fuck that lmao
12/1/18, 8:08 PM - Parker: tim did u kiss her
12/1/18, 8:08 PM - Matt Casali: V relevant

12/1/18, 8:11 PM - Vaughn: ^
12/1/18, 8:11 PM - Alex Starr: It is tho
12/1/18, 8:16 PM - Tim Ko: Nope haha
12/1/18, 8:17 PM - Tim Ko: She didn’t deserve my kiss
12/1/18, 8:18 PM - Tim Ko: I poured out my heart for her and got wreckkkkkkkked
12/1/18, 8:20 PM - Ricky: tahts right time, you don't need that emotional destruction
12/1/18, 8:22 PM - Tim Ko: Mhmmmm
12/1/18, 8:23 PM - Tim Ko: Ok I’m being a little dramatic haha, wasn’t entirely her fault, she was great and tried her best
12/1/18, 8:23 PM - Darren: Sure tim
12/1/18, 8:24 PM - Tim Ko: I think just her intentions were a little different and she rushed into things herself and difference in culture led to the disconnect form her point of view
12/1/18, 8:24 PM - Matt Casali: We never facetimed
12/1/18, 8:24 PM - Alex Starr: I’m gonna have to mix it up and say
12/1/18, 8:24 PM - Alex Starr: Were they tho?
12/1/18, 8:25 PM - Vaughn: Im gunna mix it up and say
12/1/18, 8:25 PM - Vaughn: 🖕🏿
12/1/18, 8:25 PM - Vaughn: Yeeees tim
12/1/18, 8:26 PM - Alex Starr: Hardly a mix up
12/1/18, 8:26 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah I’m pretty move on by now, just those moments of bittersweet memories of the good times make me feel down a bit
12/1/18, 8:27 PM - Tim Ko: I don’t want to repress them, but at the same time don’t want to dwell on them
12/1/18, 8:29 PM - Matt Casali: Well if theres a sweetness to the memories then dont try to bury them, but if it's too painful, then theres no reason to keep inflicting pain on yourself
12/1/18, 8:30 PM - Matt Casali: But really, just keep living your life, more good memories will come up and you'll find people who are worth the time that you give to them
12/1/18, 8:33 PM - Tim Ko: Mmmm thanks Matt!!
12/1/18, 8:33 PM - Tim Ko: That’s very encouraging!!
12/1/18, 8:33 PM - Tim Ko: ❤
12/1/18, 8:34 PM - Matt Casali: You're welcome tim :)
12/1/18, 8:34 PM - Tim Ko: Just wanna say again that I love all of you for just being there for me and supporting me. Y’all mean so much to me and I’m so indebted to u guys
12/1/18, 8:35 PM - Matt Casali: No debt haha, I think I'm speaking for everyone when I say that we appreciate being able to be there for you
12/1/18, 8:36 PM - Darren: No
12/1/18, 8:36 PM - Matt Casali: Well I speak for everyone is who has semblance of a heart
12/1/18, 8:36 PM - Matt Casali: Jk <3 you darren
12/1/18, 8:37 PM - Tim Ko: Hahahaha
12/1/18, 8:37 PM - Darren: No
12/1/18, 8:37 PM - Tim Ko: U know darren was the first person I talked to on the phone when she broke up with me haha
12/1/18, 8:38 PM - Matt Casali: Haha believe me, I dont doubt Darren's goodness at all
12/1/18, 8:38 PM - Alex Starr: That’s mildly unexpected
12/1/18, 8:38 PM - Alex Starr: Certain notes imply otherwise
12/1/18, 8:43 PM - Darren: I agree
12/1/18, 8:52 PM - Parker: ^
12/1/18, 8:53 PM - Parker: ^
12/6/18, 9:30 PM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
12/6/18, 9:30 PM - Collin Hurst: wrong chat lol
12/6/18, 9:30 PM - Alex Starr: Honestly more sexual than that picture of your knees
12/6/18, 9:31 PM - Collin Hurst: that little thing is pretty sexual so thats fine
12/6/18, 9:31 PM - Darren: That picture made me start using mine
12/6/18, 9:31 PM - Alex Starr: I honestly thought at first it was a very subtle way of announcing you’d found the g spot
12/6/18, 9:31 PM - Vaughn: Same
12/6/18, 9:32 PM - Collin Hurst: wtf haha
12/6/18, 9:32 PM - Parker: hahaha what
12/6/18, 9:32 PM - Alex Starr: It’s a red spot right next to the g
12/6/18, 9:32 PM - Collin Hurst: lol
12/6/18, 9:34 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
12/6/18, 9:34 PM - Vaughn: Thank god its december
12/6/18, 9:34 PM - Parker: <Media omitted>
12/6/18, 9:37 PM - Darren: They nerfed Sonic hard
12/6/18, 9:38 PM - Vaughn: Yeah not being able to run through people hurt him a lot
12/6/18, 9:38 PM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
12/6/18, 9:39 PM - Darren: You also can't hold spin dash indefinitely, so it isn't a godly move in the neutral. And they removed the ability to spinshot in the same way. He's also noticably slower which is not cool
12/6/18, 9:39 PM - Alex Starr: How’s zss?
12/6/18, 9:42 PM - Darren: I didn't play/watch any games with zss
12/6/18, 9:42 PM - Alex Starr: Basically on a scale of Oklahoma to fat kid on a see saw, how tilted will you be when I land one up air?
12/6/18, 9:42 PM - Alex Starr: I’ll have to check Nairos stream
12/6/18, 9:43 PM - Darren: Yes
12/7/18, 4:40 PM - Tim Ko: Was thinking of sending Julia this
12/7/18, 4:40 PM - Tim Ko: Hey Julia, I hope you have been doing well this past week. I’m just reaching out because I feel like I have for the most part moved past everything and I know you said you would like to still be friends and I think I am in a place where I would like that. I think that even though things didn’t work out, I feel like we still developed a friendship and I think that is important to me moving forward, that even though we aren’t together we can still remain friends. With that said, I don’t expect to super close friends or anything, but more so through our communities such as through gmma or wherever we may bump into each other. Just so there is no ambiguity I wanna make it clear that I’m not looking to get back together or anything like that. I also just wanna let you know that there aren’t any hard feelings or bitterness from my side and I look forward to what God has in store for the future!
12/7/18, 4:40 PM - Tim Ko: What do y’all think
12/7/18, 4:40 PM - Tim Ko: My intentions are to just be on good terms and be normal friends
12/7/18, 4:41 PM - Vaughn: I really like it tim
12/7/18, 4:42 PM - Tim Ko: Thx
12/7/18, 4:42 PM - Darren: I'd wait a couple weeks to send a post mortem
12/7/18, 4:43 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah seems too soon
12/7/18, 4:43 PM - Alex Starr: Maybe post break
12/7/18, 4:43 PM - Darren: Definitely not prefinals
12/7/18, 4:43 PM - Alex Starr: Especially right before finals might not be received as well as it could be
12/7/18, 4:44 PM - Tim Ko: Ok for sure
12/7/18, 4:44 PM - Tim Ko: I thought it was a little too soon also
12/7/18, 4:45 PM - Tim Ko: I feel like I’m in the place of mind to send it tho
12/7/18, 4:45 PM - Tim Ko: Like sending this would be kinda like closing the book idk
12/7/18, 4:46 PM - Alex Starr: The book is closed to her tho
12/7/18, 4:46 PM - Alex Starr: This would be opening the book to add a post script
12/7/18, 4:47 PM - Tim Ko: I don’t give a shit whether her book is open or closed lol
12/7/18, 4:47 PM - Tim Ko: I just wanna close mine
12/7/18, 4:47 PM - Alex Starr: Seems to contradict your message
12/7/18, 4:48 PM - Collin Hurst: ^
12/7/18, 4:48 PM - Tim Ko: How so
12/7/18, 4:48 PM - Tim Ko: In my message I said I wanna move on
12/7/18, 4:48 PM - Tim Ko: Ehh maybe just writing this is good enough
12/7/18, 4:48 PM - Tim Ko: No need to send?
12/7/18, 4:49 PM - Tim Ko: What are ur guys’s experience with sending post mordems
12/7/18, 4:50 PM - Alex Starr: “Aren’t any hard feelings” -> “don’t give a shit about her book” just saying
12/7/18, 4:50 PM - Darren: Be prepared to cry in the library for an hour and have a devastating conversation following it
12/7/18, 4:50 PM - Tim Ko: Oh shit lol
12/7/18, 4:50 PM - Tim Ko: Honestly idc what she sends back
12/7/18, 4:51 PM - Tim Ko: Ehhh maybe I won’t send it
12/7/18, 4:51 PM - Alex Starr: Ya if u don’t care about her response no point in sending it
12/7/18, 4:51 PM - Alex Starr: Tho something tells me you’ll be sending it in about 2 and a half hours
12/7/18, 4:51 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
12/7/18, 4:52 PM - Collin Hurst: a message of that length kind of shows that you care a lot
12/7/18, 4:52 PM - Collin Hurst: if thats what you want to show
12/7/18, 4:52 PM - Tim Ko: I care that we are in good terms and still friends that’s all
12/7/18, 4:52 PM - Tim Ko: Hmm ok maybe I’ll think of a shorter message
12/7/18, 4:52 PM - Collin Hurst: ^^ you should send that lol
12/7/18, 4:53 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
12/7/18, 4:53 PM - Tim Ko: Ok yeah
12/7/18, 4:53 PM - Tim Ko: Good call
12/7/18, 4:53 PM - Alex Starr: Tho use “on good terms”
12/7/18, 4:53 PM - Matt Casali: I'd advise against sending anything tim
12/7/18, 4:53 PM - Tim Ko: A long ass message shows can convey wrong intention
12/7/18, 4:53 PM - Tim Ko: Really?
12/7/18, 4:53 PM - Alex Starr: In good terms sounds like you just prefer fall semester
12/7/18, 4:53 PM - Matt Casali: Yep
12/7/18, 4:53 PM - Alex Starr: ^
12/7/18, 4:53 PM - Alex Starr: It’s gonna happen Matt accept it
12/7/18, 4:54 PM - Tim Ko: I just don’t want it to be weird between us I guess
12/7/18, 4:54 PM - Tim Ko: That’s all
12/7/18, 4:54 PM - Parker: It’s only weird if you make it weird
12/7/18, 4:54 PM - Parker: 😕
12/7/18, 4:54 PM - Matt Casali: If things didnt continue on naturally theres no reason to push a friendship that doesnt want to happen
12/7/18, 4:54 PM - Alex Starr: ^
12/7/18, 4:55 PM - Tim Ko: Well she said she wanted to remain friends
12/7/18, 4:55 PM - Matt Casali: I've tried
12/7/18, 4:55 PM - Tim Ko: And I told her I need space
12/7/18, 4:56 PM - Matt Casali: People say that a lot tim
12/7/18, 4:56 PM - Matt Casali: Some people mean it
12/7/18, 4:56 PM - Tim Ko: I see
12/7/18, 4:56 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
12/7/18, 4:56 PM - Matt Casali: Some people dont
12/7/18, 4:56 PM - Tim Ko: Damn it
12/7/18, 4:56 PM - Parker: i agree it seems too soon
12/7/18, 4:56 PM - Tim Ko: This is when brutally honest is the best
12/7/18, 4:56 PM - Parker: give it some time
12/7/18, 4:56 PM - Parker: but don’t cut all communication
12/7/18, 4:56 PM - Alex Starr: No
12/7/18, 4:56 PM - Alex Starr: Just honest no need to be brutal
12/7/18, 4:56 PM - Parker: bc then i feel like that’s when it becomes weird when you happen to run into each other
12/7/18, 4:56 PM - Tim Ko: ^
12/7/18, 5:01 PM - Darren: If there are things you wish you could have said to her that you didn't get the chance to, and these things are so important you think you _need_ to go through the motions of telling her, then say them to her
12/7/18, 5:01 PM - Darren: But if they really aren't that important, don't.
12/7/18, 5:01 PM - Alex Starr: So basically if you have to say something say something?
12/7/18, 5:02 PM - Parker: ^
12/7/18, 5:02 PM - Tim Ko: Hmmm for sure
12/7/18, 5:03 PM - Tim Ko: Ok I’ll think about this more haha
12/7/18, 5:03 PM - Tim Ko: Thx for ur advices
12/7/18, 5:03 PM - Alex Starr: Calling it message in t minus 2 hours
12/7/18, 5:03 PM - Parker: ^
12/7/18, 5:03 PM - Matt Casali: If you're trying to get closure, remember that it's nearly impossible to get
12/7/18, 5:04 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah for sure
12/7/18, 5:04 PM - Tim Ko: I don’t think I am tho
12/7/18, 5:04 PM - Darren: I think it's really easy to want to send a "hey I got over it, we should still be friends" message because it makes you feel like you're a big man and you don't want to come out of a breakup damaged. Which is bullshit
12/7/18, 5:04 PM - Alex Starr: You literally used he words closed the book Tim haha
12/7/18, 5:04 PM - Alex Starr: The*
12/7/18, 5:05 PM - Parker: ^
12/7/18, 5:05 PM - Parker: you clearly are haha
12/7/18, 5:05 PM - Parker: which isn’t a bad thing
12/7/18, 5:05 PM - Matt Casali: It's for sure not a good thing either
12/7/18, 5:05 PM - Alex Starr: Well it’s probably not
12/7/18, 5:06 PM - Tim Ko: Ok so no message is better
12/7/18, 5:07 PM - Tim Ko: What if I feel like I still wanna be friends
12/7/18, 5:07 PM - Alex Starr: Just send it
12/7/18, 5:07 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
12/7/18, 5:07 PM - Alex Starr: It’s like sex with Kobe Bryant
12/7/18, 5:07 PM - Tim Ko: I honestly have no intentions of getting back together
12/7/18, 5:07 PM - Alex Starr: Whether you want it to or not, no amount of us blowing a whistle is gonna stop anything
12/7/18, 5:08 PM - Tim Ko: Ok I feel like not sending is the wiser thing to do lol
12/7/18, 5:08 PM - Parker: send one but maybe shorter and maybe in 2 weeks
12/7/18, 5:08 PM - Alex Starr: And maybe not at all
12/7/18, 5:08 PM - Matt Casali: Reverse psychology I like it
12/7/18, 5:08 PM - Tim Ko: Since this is my first time experienceing this I’m really not too sure what the move is
12/7/18, 5:08 PM - Matt Casali: Not sending it is prob the move
12/7/18, 5:08 PM - Parker: ^
12/7/18, 5:08 PM - Alex Starr: Text her New Year’s Eve at 3:30 am “U up?”
12/7/18, 5:09 PM - Parker: please do
12/7/18, 5:09 PM - Alex Starr: But definitely not before finals
12/7/18, 5:09 PM - Tim Ko: For sure
12/7/18, 5:09 PM - Alex Starr: _sends it tonight at 8_
12/7/18, 5:12 PM - Tim Ko: Hey Julia, I hope you have been doing well. I know it’s been a while but I’m just reaching out because I feel like I have moved past everything and I wanted to be on good terms and remain friends as we’ll see each other in gmma this coming semester.
12/7/18, 5:12 PM - Tim Ko: I’ll send this sometime during winter break
12/7/18, 5:12 PM - Alex Starr: Wrong number who’s this?
12/7/18, 5:13 PM - Tim Ko: Nice and short?
12/7/18, 5:15 PM - Parker: i’d say something in between those two would be the sweet spot
12/7/18, 5:16 PM - Parker: that almost seems too short
12/7/18, 5:16 PM - Parker: but that’s just me
12/7/18, 5:17 PM - Alex Starr: Nah this is the sweet spot
12/7/18, 5:17 PM - Matt Casali: Do you want tim
12/7/18, 5:18 PM - Matt Casali: But again, you shouldnt send a message
12/7/18, 5:18 PM - Tim Ko: Lol ok I’ll tinker with it
12/7/18, 5:18 PM - Alex Starr: It’s pretty content irrelevant
12/8/18, 1:02 AM - Jason Greenberg: Its a nice sentiment but i would not send anything yet
12/8/18, 1:02 AM - Jason Greenberg: Its just really fast
12/8/18, 1:32 AM - Tim Ko: Sent her the message
12/8/18, 1:32 AM - Tim Ko: Hey Julia, I hope you have been doing well! I just wanted to reach out because I feel like I have for the most part moved past everything and I know you said you would like to still be friends and I think I am in a place where I would like that. I just wanna be on good terms and since we’re both in gmma I would like to continue our friendship through that. I hope studying has been well and good luck on your finals. I’ll see you around in the upcoming semester!
12/8/18, 1:32 AM - Darren: Fucking Christ
12/8/18, 1:33 AM - Tim Ko: She sent back: thanks for reaching out, I’ll definately see u around and I hope ur finals go well
12/8/18, 1:33 AM - Tim Ko: Hahaha
12/8/18, 1:33 AM - Tim Ko: Thinks this was the best case scenario
12/8/18, 1:36 AM - Darren: @16507145032 you're a wizard
12/8/18, 1:36 AM - Darren: More of a prophet
12/8/18, 1:43 AM - Tim Ko: Ehh he was off by a few hours
12/8/18, 1:44 AM - Jason Greenberg: Whats done is done
12/8/18, 1:45 AM - Collin Hurst: Lmao
12/8/18, 1:45 AM - Jason Greenberg: I guess whatever you need was the best move
12/8/18, 6:58 AM - Alex Starr: Forgot you go to sleep so late
12/8/18, 7:00 AM - Parker: Lol
12/8/18, 7:00 AM - Parker: too predictable
12/8/18, 9:02 AM - Ricky: Hahaha
12/8/18, 9:02 AM - Ricky: It’s ok tim, you do you boi
12/8/18, 9:02 AM - Alex Starr: No he doesn’t do that anymore he’s been very clear
12/8/18, 9:03 AM - Alex Starr: Also last note on the subject, no one sends an “I’m not bitter and have moved on message” unless they are a little bitter or haven’t quite moved on
12/8/18, 9:15 AM - Ricky: Well, unless they have
12/8/18, 9:15 AM - Ricky: But most likely they haven’t haha
12/8/18, 9:15 AM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
12/8/18, 9:15 AM - Jason Greenberg: Its all good timmy is growin up
12/8/18, 9:22 AM - Tim Ko: Lol
12/8/18, 9:28 AM - Parker: v true
12/8/18, 9:52 AM - Tim Ko: Whatever it’s no big deal
12/8/18, 9:54 AM - Alex Starr: He said, after feeling so obligated to send something that he ignored every piece of advice
12/8/18, 10:19 AM - Parker: hahahahaha
12/10/18, 6:45 PM - Matt Casali: <Media omitted>
12/10/18, 6:45 PM - Vaughn: Pic or it disnt happen

12/10/18, 6:50 PM - Ricky: ahahah
12/10/18, 6:50 PM - Ricky: i think the internet is a reasonable place to find it, you don't need to ask people for thme hahaha
12/10/18, 6:51 PM - Alex Starr: That’s not authentic
12/10/18, 6:51 PM - Alex Starr: And then they won’t be private text conversations either
12/10/18, 6:52 PM - Ricky: haha alight alex

3/10/19, 10:09 AM - Parker: ^
3/10/19, 10:09 AM - Vaughn: I cared about her a lot guys
3/10/19, 10:10 AM - Jason Greenberg: You broke up with her?
3/10/19, 10:10 AM - Vaughn: Im just so confused
3/10/19, 10:10 AM - Vaughn: Yeah
3/10/19, 10:10 AM - Jason Greenberg: Oh man
3/10/19, 10:10 AM - Jason Greenberg: What are you feeling confused about?
3/10/19, 10:11 AM - Vaughn: Whether what we had was worth trying for
3/10/19, 10:11 AM - Vaughn: Or if im just the problem
3/10/19, 10:12 AM - Jason Greenberg: Can I ask what ultimately led you to break up with her?
3/10/19, 10:13 AM - Vaughn: I think I underestimated how much Id be invested in all of it
3/10/19, 10:13 AM - Matt Casali: I don't think so, vaughn
3/10/19, 10:13 AM - Collin Hurst: you broke up with her?
3/10/19, 10:13 AM - Vaughn: Im convinced im not ready for a relationship like this
3/10/19, 10:13 AM - Collin Hurst: oh wait
3/10/19, 10:14 AM - Vaughn: Ive been neglecting people
3/10/19, 10:14 AM - Collin Hurst: what made you break up with her vs. talking it out
3/10/19, 10:14 AM - Matt Casali: I dont feel neglected
3/10/19, 10:14 AM - Parker: ^^
3/10/19, 10:14 AM - Matt Casali: If that's something you're worried about
3/10/19, 10:14 AM - Vaughn: Ive been missing out on lasting friendships
3/10/19, 10:14 AM - Jason Greenberg: Well there other people in his life besides us
3/10/19, 10:14 AM - Matt Casali: I know
3/10/19, 10:14 AM - Vaughn: And putting too much effort into something that i subconciously think wont last
3/10/19, 10:15 AM - Matt Casali: Imo opinion, if you had fun with it than it doesnt matter if it wasnt going to last
3/10/19, 10:15 AM - Jason Greenberg: Like because of your compatibility or because it’s a romantic relationship more generally?
3/10/19, 10:15 AM - Vaughn: Yeah but I was being selfish
3/10/19, 10:15 AM - Matt Casali: The effort you put in was worth it if you enjoyed yourself
3/10/19, 10:16 AM - Collin Hurst: about what
3/10/19, 10:16 AM - Vaughn: It wasnt worth it if it hurt her matt
3/10/19, 10:16 AM - Vaughn: I waited too long
3/10/19, 10:17 AM - Matt Casali: It was a mistake, bud
3/10/19, 10:17 AM - Matt Casali: I know you would never intentionally hurt someone
3/10/19, 10:18 AM - Jason Greenberg: Wouldn’t last because...?
3/10/19, 10:18 AM - Vaughn: Its hard to tell jason
3/10/19, 10:18 AM - Vaughn: Im so inexperienced
3/10/19, 10:19 AM - Vaughn: We were very compatible in my eyes
3/10/19, 10:19 AM - Vaughn: But relative to what?
3/10/19, 10:19 AM - Jason Greenberg: Ahh
3/10/19, 10:19 AM - Jason Greenberg: Fair
3/10/19, 10:20 AM - Vaughn: The first 2 months i learned so much about myself
3/10/19, 10:20 AM - Vaughn: It was addicting because i was closer to someone than ive ever been
3/10/19, 10:20 AM - Vaughn: But at some point i didnt feel i was progressing as much
3/10/19, 10:20 AM - Vaughn: And I was limiting myself in the big picture
3/10/19, 10:21 AM - Jason Greenberg: I understand what you mean
3/10/19, 10:22 AM - Vaughn: Big picture in the last day i think is that I realized i cared more about the possible friendships that i was losing more than saving the relationship
3/10/19, 10:22 AM - Collin Hurst: did you start the relationshi bc you wanted self improvement or to get closer to her?
3/10/19, 10:22 AM - Vaughn: I wanted her in my life
3/10/19, 10:22 AM - Collin Hurst: also what makes you think you are losing friendships bc of that relationship
3/10/19, 10:22 AM - Jason Greenberg: Damn if you’re sure about that it does sound like you learned a lot about yourself
3/10/19, 10:23 AM - Vaughn: Because i can see it happening
3/10/19, 10:24 AM - Vaughn: Deep down i was afraid that if I waited too long id have nothing after ending it
3/10/19, 10:24 AM - Vaughn: I can salvage something out of the people in my house
3/10/19, 10:25 AM - Jason Greenberg: Wow
3/10/19, 10:25 AM - Ricky: Damn I’m so sorry vaughn
3/10/19, 10:26 AM - Vaughn: You guys are a constant and im so grateful ill never lose you guys
3/10/19, 10:26 AM - Jason Greenberg: I think of possible reasons to end a relationship that’s a very mature one that most people would really struggle with
3/10/19, 10:26 AM - Jason Greenberg: Aw buddy
3/10/19, 10:27 AM - Jason Greenberg: I feel similarly and a big part of my life rn is trying to cement a way to live in the Bay Area as adult and be near y’all
3/10/19, 10:27 AM - Matt Casali: I think that if your relationship was limiting you in that way, that was a good decision
3/10/19, 10:27 AM - Matt Casali: But I also wanna give you hope that not all intimate relationships are a choice between making friends and spending time with your SO
3/10/19, 10:28 AM - Jason Greenberg: How did you meet Lluvia again?
3/10/19, 10:29 AM - Vaughn: She lives in our transfer house
3/10/19, 10:29 AM - Jason Greenberg: Oh that’s right
3/10/19, 10:29 AM - Vaughn: Pretty tightknit house and mutual friends made us cross paths in the lounge pretty often
3/10/19, 10:32 AM - Jason Greenberg: I just remembered this isn’t your first serious relationship
3/10/19, 10:33 AM - Vaughn: Relative to what sarah and i had, it feels like my first
3/10/19, 10:34 AM - Jason Greenberg: Interesting
3/10/19, 10:34 AM - Jason Greenberg: Was the break up amicable?
3/10/19, 10:34 AM - Vaughn: I didnt see a future with lluvia
3/10/19, 10:34 AM - Vaughn: So yes?
3/10/19, 10:35 AM - Vaughn: I was hoping shed break up with me eventually
3/10/19, 10:35 AM - Vaughn: Wouldve made all this easier
3/10/19, 10:35 AM - Collin Hurst: so she didnt see one with you?
3/10/19, 10:35 AM - Vaughn: *googles amicable*
3/10/19, 10:35 AM - Jason Greenberg: I mean was it friendly?
3/10/19, 10:35 AM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
3/10/19, 10:35 AM - Parker: Like friendly lol
3/10/19, 10:36 AM - Vaughn: We loved each other
3/10/19, 10:36 AM - Vaughn: I trust that we'll be friends after this
3/10/19, 10:36 AM - Vaughn: We talked things through all the time throughout this whole relationship
3/10/19, 10:37 AM - Parker: well that’s good
3/10/19, 10:37 AM - Vaughn: And we scheduled a talk for later today
3/10/19, 10:37 AM - Vaughn: I asked her if she genuinly thought wed be friends after this and she said probably
3/10/19, 10:37 AM - Vaughn: But i fuckin broke her heart man
3/10/19, 10:38 AM - Vaughn: Fuckin sucks im gunna shpwer
3/10/19, 10:38 AM - Jason Greenberg: I’m sorry dude
3/10/19, 10:40 AM - Parker: i’m sorry vaughn
3/10/19, 10:40 AM - Parker: we’re always here for ya
3/10/19, 10:41 AM - Ricky: ^
3/10/19, 10:41 AM - Ricky: Love you bud
3/10/19, 1:08 PM - Tim Ko: Damn bro I’m so sorry man :((
3/10/19, 1:08 PM - Tim Ko: We all here for u ❤
3/10/19, 1:10 PM - Tim Ko: I think what u did was mature man, u recognized that there prob wasn’t a future and didn’t let the relationship drag out
3/10/19, 1:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: Also we are gonna do hella fun stuff this break coming up to take your mind of things! :)
3/10/19, 1:34 PM - Vaughn: I appreciate it guys thanks :)
3/10/19, 1:57 PM - Tim Ko: ^!!
5/11/19, 5:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: Having some trouble with the gf
5/11/19, 5:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: Could use some help
5/11/19, 5:35 PM - Matt Casali: What's up?
5/11/19, 5:35 PM - Matt Casali: I'm sorry
5/11/19, 5:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: We’ve reached something that I see a potentially irreconcilable difference
5/11/19, 5:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: as a*
5/11/19, 5:37 PM - Matt Casali: And what is that?
5/11/19, 5:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’m going to have trouble explaining it
5/11/19, 5:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: But I’ll try
5/11/19, 5:38 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah no worries
5/11/19, 5:39 PM - Darren: You wanna write it all out and tell us when you're done, so we don't start trying to analyze too early?
5/11/19, 5:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ok
5/11/19, 5:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: In her view, if you talk about a problem you’re repeatedly and don’t do anything about it (and in her assumption talking it through is inaction), then you’re no longer justified to talk about it and she doesn’t want to help/hear it. She also has revealed that she would never offer or support a solution for me that wouldn’t work for her personally. The conclusion I’ve come to, is that trying to refute these things or point out the problems with them for me is annoying to her and she doesn’t seem to budge. I see big problems with this for me because I don’t want to feel annoying for talking about a problem, and I want to feel like I can complain without her needing to solve my problem, and that her stress about my problems shouldn’t translate to annoyance at me for having them or dealing with them the way that I do
5/11/19, 5:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: Because then I’m worse off after each interaction
5/11/19, 5:47 PM - Jason Greenberg: Sometimes she can be very helpful if I’m sad  or feeling insecure about something, but for other things it goes I’ll offer a solution or she will to a problem I have and she says “just do that” blindly
5/11/19, 5:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: It feels awful when she does because I can never say enough to tell her on how many levels that makes me feel wrong
5/11/19, 5:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: End transmission
5/11/19, 5:53 PM - Darren: How often does this problem arise (you feeling like you can't talk to her about a problem you're having _and/or_ her giving an unsatisfactorily binary solution to a more complex issue)?
5/11/19, 5:56 PM - Jason Greenberg: I usually talk to her about my problems regardless and try to explain why it’s ok for me to talk about them and how it’s helpful. But she doesn’t want to be helpful on my terms if it looks drastically different than how she’d like to go about something. I’d say low 40s%
5/11/19, 5:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: I haven’t been paying attention so so closely but that she’s defined it in these clear terms it scares me
5/11/19, 5:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: She hasn’t had the chance to define things like this before to me, or if she had I hadn’t payed attention
5/11/19, 5:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: She also often tells me when thinks our arguments are pointless and a waste of time if we revisit a point that I feel was unresolved
5/11/19, 5:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: that she thinks our arguments*
5/11/19, 5:59 PM - Alex Starr: So these situations usually arise when you guys are discussing potential problems with your relationship or just problems you’ve been having in general?
5/11/19, 6:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: Both kinds yes
5/11/19, 6:05 PM - Darren: Ok, the way I've interpreted it, there are 2 major issues that are connected but not the same:

1) she is entirely objective/solution oriented when it comes to problems. A conversation that doesn't have an actionable plan isn't worth having, and if there is a solution offered during the conversation then you better take it.

2) she only discusses solutions from her perspective, so that disconnect between haley-centric and jason-centric solutions further limits the number of conversations you can have.

And the intersection of those two issues covers the relationship problems at hand. Is this fair, or am I off?
5/11/19, 6:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah you got it
5/11/19, 6:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: And the second point is something I hadn’t noticed and alarms me
5/11/19, 6:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: And for more context
5/11/19, 6:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: The problem today was that I overeat when I’m high and she continually asserts that it’s a conscious decision to do that, so I should just stop doing that. I explained why I don’t think it’s a conscious decision which is pretty stressful to have to do, but she didn’t see it that way regardless
5/11/19, 6:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: She just seemed more annoyed that I was talking about it again and hadn’t fixed it yet
5/11/19, 6:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: So her conclusion: we need to stop talking about it
5/11/19, 6:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: What I’m trying to do i see ways that I can reconcile these differences, and if so is it worth it to fight
5/11/19, 6:15 PM - Darren: Alright, let's sideline discussion of action plans for the time being
5/11/19, 6:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ok
5/11/19, 6:17 PM - Darren: After you explained why you don't think it's a conscious decision, how did she then reject it? Just a flat "I don't agree, we're done here"?
5/11/19, 6:19 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah I kept asking her to give me reasons after she rejected my explanation of literally saying how eating is more of a reward than not eating and it’s a choice not to eat, but she would say something like “because that’s a choice you make”. A headache of circular logic
5/11/19, 6:19 PM - Jason Greenberg: And recently she’s been telling me she doesn’t want to hear evidence or reasoning when I argue with her
5/11/19, 6:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: In general
5/11/19, 6:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: I think it’s bad
5/11/19, 6:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: Saying this out loud
5/11/19, 6:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: To be fair I’ve been really focusing on thinking logically lately and using evidence and it’s got to be a headache for her too
5/11/19, 6:24 PM - Darren: But to be clear, this was a problem before your recent push for logic?
5/11/19, 6:25 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah
5/11/19, 6:25 PM - Darren: And the only new information is just how unwilling she is to be empathetic towards your problems/pov?
5/11/19, 6:27 PM - Jason Greenberg: That is new and I hadn’t fully understood her just how objective and incompatible with mine her approach to problem solving is
5/11/19, 6:31 PM - Darren: How often does she complain to you about her problems? And when she does, does is seem like she's consistent with her solution oriented framework?
5/11/19, 6:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: Often, and no
5/11/19, 6:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: Well yes and no she’s consistent
5/11/19, 6:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: Because she has told me before that she doesn’t want me to try to fix things sometimes she just wants to complain and she has complained to me about the same subject over and over for a problem she doesn’t have much control over like a softball coach who is brutal. So that seems like a violation to me, but she doesn’t complain about things she thinks maybe she does have control over? I think we have different ideas about what you can control and that’s also causing problems
5/11/19, 6:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: I should add that she doesn’t like to talk about issues at the level of depth that I like to and when I talk about a problem in depth we’ve figured out that she sees that as me making the problem more complicated (than it needs to be) and is annoyed at me
5/11/19, 6:39 PM - Darren: I think I have a good sense of what level of depth you prefer, but can you give an example of how in depth she goes?
5/11/19, 6:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hmm
5/11/19, 6:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: That’s super hard to nail down
5/11/19, 6:46 PM - Darren: Was my question phrased in an ambiguous way or is her level of depth highly variable?
5/11/19, 6:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: It’s variable
5/11/19, 6:47 PM - Jason Greenberg: She goes in depth about concepts not directly affecting her better than
5/11/19, 6:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: ones closer to home
5/11/19, 6:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: Is my sense
5/11/19, 6:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: I think I’m unsatisfied with it is also my sense
5/11/19, 6:49 PM - Darren: Unsatisfied by the level of depth she goes into?
5/11/19, 6:49 PM - Darren: Also, does she go in depth into the symptoms of the problem or possible solutions or both?
5/11/19, 6:52 PM - Collin Hurst: This seems hard Jason
5/11/19, 6:52 PM - Collin Hurst: Like a deep thing for her that is not easily changed
5/11/19, 6:52 PM - Collin Hurst: That's just what I see thou
5/11/19, 6:53 PM - Collin Hurst: Have you ever said directly like think about it from my shoes?
5/11/19, 6:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: She doesn’t go into depth here. Circumstantial information is how I’m remembering the information she gathers. She’ll use something I give her though that isn’t circumstance at times
5/11/19, 6:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: Or seems willing to
5/11/19, 6:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yes all the time
5/11/19, 6:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: That’s what I’m worried about
5/11/19, 6:55 PM - Darren: Having to ask for empathy is a terrible feeling
5/11/19, 6:57 PM - Darren: Ok, are there tangible differences between your conversations in person versus online with regard to her willingness to go in-depth into problems?
5/11/19, 6:58 PM - Darren: Do you have any theories on why this could be?
5/11/19, 6:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: Good question. At times there are differences but not really in these areas
5/11/19, 6:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah it sucks man
5/11/19, 7:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: I think it’s a personal preference
5/11/19, 7:01 PM - Matt Casali: I had to do this with Fredi and it sucked
5/11/19, 7:01 PM - Jason Greenberg: Very different upbringing than me
5/11/19, 7:02 PM - Jason Greenberg: It really makes me question my sanity
5/11/19, 7:02 PM - Matt Casali: Also, Darren you're a really good person to talk to I just wanna put that out there and I'm glad that you're here for Jason and the rest of us
5/11/19, 7:02 PM - Matt Casali: And it's a bad hit to confidence
5/11/19, 7:02 PM - Parker: That’s part of the drama i’ve had this term
5/11/19, 7:02 PM - Parker: the asking for empathy that is
5/11/19, 7:02 PM - Matt Casali: You should be able to express your feelings without having their validity being questioned from the get go
5/11/19, 7:03 PM - Parker: /also realizing others different upbringings and how that influences their actions and feelings
5/11/19, 7:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: Well maybe I’m expressing them too much is what I’m questioning
5/11/19, 7:03 PM - Darren: Aw thanks matt
5/11/19, 7:04 PM - Parker: agree completely
5/11/19, 7:04 PM - Matt Casali: Imo that's impossible but I'm also _very_ emotionally charged all of the time
5/11/19, 7:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: Right cuz the extension of if she doesn’t want what I want to express is that we aren’t compatible
5/11/19, 7:05 PM - Tim Ko: ^
5/11/19, 7:05 PM - Matt Casali: I think the only thing I can say on the subject (albeit a biased and only based on a comparison I've made) is that I would have been happier if I didnt let Fredi do that to me and my social confidence.
5/11/19, 7:06 PM - Matt Casali: And in a space where you cant express yourself an abort is a very good option
5/11/19, 7:06 PM - Matt Casali: But drastic
5/11/19, 7:06 PM - Jason Greenberg: Right it’s drastic because she’s the closest relationship in my life rn
5/11/19, 7:06 PM - Darren: I want to focus on that different upbringing disparity. Because it seems like you really like to discuss your feelings (ala feeling circles) and she really doesn't. 

Obviously that has caused issues in the past, but have there been things in your relationship that have bridged that gap or made it easier (instances where either of you were willing and able to act more like the other)?
5/11/19, 7:07 PM - Matt Casali: Fredi was mine too. Of course, i didnt end it because of that so it's a lot different
5/11/19, 7:07 PM - Tim Ko: From what I know about u, u aren’t the type to overreact or wear ur emotions on ur sleeves so I think I expressing ur feelings is reasonable
5/11/19, 7:07 PM - Tim Ko: *u
5/11/19, 7:07 PM - Matt Casali: You can have so many opportunities to be close with someone who will treat you better
5/11/19, 7:08 PM - Darren: This is very possible imo. You can definitely accidentally overstep when talking to someone you feel very connected to. The issues arise when you can't come to a mutual agreement about how to change - especially if that conversation cannot be brought up in a healthy way
5/11/19, 7:08 PM - Matt Casali: Makes sense
5/11/19, 7:10 PM - Matt Casali: But also, it you cant have a healthy conversation about change, it could be because the emotional vocab has been limited
5/11/19, 7:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: We’ve both made concessions for each other in the past that has to do with trying the other persons viewpoints and ideas (eg. her trying to be more expressive, and me trying to be less sensitive)
5/11/19, 7:10 PM - Matt Casali: Which is a recurring cycle
5/11/19, 7:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: Well not being able to have the healthy conversation would be the failure because then we can’t correct anything
5/11/19, 7:11 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah
5/11/19, 7:11 PM - Matt Casali: So do you feel like you could have a healthy conversation
5/11/19, 7:11 PM - Matt Casali: Also, being sensitive in a relationship is a plus not a minus imo
5/11/19, 7:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’m gonna keep going at it
5/11/19, 7:12 PM - Matt Casali: Keep track of that emotional toll, Jason. It creeps up on you and it's easy to justify for a better future. A lot of time it just ends up stacking up though
5/11/19, 7:13 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah I don’t know if I can sit with considering somethings overstepping. I also have a hard time sitting with feeling like I’m annoying in a big way for things I feel are pretty central to my person, compounded by the fact that it’s my romantic relationship
5/11/19, 7:14 PM - Matt Casali: I feel that hard
5/11/19, 7:14 PM - Matt Casali: You're expressing a lot of things  that I've thought about with my post mortem on my relationship with fredi
5/11/19, 7:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: We have an apt to talk now I’ll update later
5/11/19, 7:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: We should talk about that
5/11/19, 7:15 PM - Darren: Good luck, don't be too annoying /s
5/11/19, 7:15 PM - Matt Casali: I mean I dont _really_ wanna talk about it too much, but I'm down to use it to help you
5/11/19, 7:17 PM - Tim Ko: Good luck man!
5/11/19, 7:37 PM - Ricky: Damn, sorry j, you got a big heart, that’s what I’ve come away from this with
5/11/19, 7:38 PM - Ricky: Also Darren, you are the bomb.com with uncovering stones in a non emotionally driven or overstepping way
5/11/19, 7:38 PM - Matt Casali: Haha there was emotion for sure
5/11/19, 7:39 PM - Ricky: Well duh, but it didn’t seem to cause bias in his questioning
5/11/19, 7:39 PM - Ricky: Also, pman it got kinda brushed over but we gotta have a triscut update soon
5/11/19, 7:41 PM - Collin Hurst: ^
5/11/19, 7:42 PM - Parker: What you want
5/11/19, 7:42 PM - Parker: bc there’s a lot involved haha
5/11/19, 7:42 PM - Ricky: Idk, I’m about to fly so can’t really discuss
5/11/19, 7:42 PM - Ricky: But just wanna make sure you’re okay
5/11/19, 7:42 PM - Parker: and it didn’t get brushed over
5/11/19, 7:42 PM - Ricky: And like hearing what ur up to
5/11/19, 7:42 PM - Parker: what jason was talking about was far more important
5/11/19, 7:42 PM - Ricky: I just mean you didn’t dive deep
5/11/19, 7:43 PM - Parker: Ok i will update in the near future maybe later tonight
5/11/19, 7:43 PM - Parker: i’m just with my mom rn
5/11/19, 7:43 PM - Ricky: Sounds good
5/11/19, 7:43 PM - Parker: ohh gotcha
5/11/19, 7:43 PM - Ricky: No prob
5/11/19, 7:43 PM - Ricky: Tell her hi!!
5/11/19, 7:43 PM - Parker: have a safe flight bb
5/11/19, 7:43 PM - Ricky: And let’s do a call!
5/11/19, 7:43 PM - Parker: She says hi!
5/11/19, 7:43 PM - Ricky: If y’all want, I’m free to after like 10
5/11/19, 7:44 PM - Darren: Update if convenient
5/11/19, 7:44 PM - Parker: i mean there’s a lot but i can try to give a gist
5/11/19, 7:45 PM - Darren: Right, and you don't have to get into it if you don't want to
5/11/19, 7:45 PM - Darren: You don't owe this world a thing
5/11/19, 7:46 PM - Parker: Yeah and that’s prob why i won’t say everything
5/11/19, 7:46 PM - Parker: bc some of it will make me sad
5/11/19, 7:46 PM - Parker: but i do wanna update you guys
5/11/19, 7:47 PM - Parker: and also i tend to overshare sometimes
5/11/19, 7:47 PM - Parker: for my own personal sake
5/11/19, 7:47 PM - Ricky: No prob boss
5/11/19, 7:47 PM - Ricky: Do you
5/11/19, 7:47 PM - Ricky: Just know you got a more than willing audience
5/11/19, 7:48 PM - Parker: I always do
5/11/19, 7:48 PM - Parker: ❤
5/11/19, 7:50 PM - Collin Hurst: ^
5/11/19, 8:03 PM - Matt Casali: ^
5/11/19, 8:04 PM - Tim Ko: :( stay strong buddy!
5/11/19, 9:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: Update: things took a turn in a positive direction. Before we started things she apologized and admitted to misunderstanding about the overeating thing unprompted. Then I expressed pretty much everything I wanted to and she listened and we struggled and she is now willing to think about the idea that I’m not getting enough from her emotionally. And she’s also open to think about ways that she can explore that
5/11/19, 9:22 PM - Jason Greenberg: So one of best case scenarios
5/11/19, 9:22 PM - Alex Starr: Nice
5/11/19, 9:25 PM - Ricky: Nice glad it went well buddy :)
5/11/19, 9:25 PM - Parker: Gang! i’m glad
5/11/19, 9:25 PM - Matt Casali: I think it was the best case Haha, that's awesome!
5/11/19, 9:28 PM - Darren: Glad to hear it, but stay vigilant in your introspection about this... The hard part is making sure reform actually happens
5/11/19, 9:30 PM - Matt Casali: I agree 100%
5/11/19, 9:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah I agree as well
5/11/19, 10:43 PM - Parker: Ok story time(this is gonna take a few mins):
5/11/19, 10:51 PM - Parker: so i’m gonna go through the beginning fast bc it’s relevant but not as relevant as other stuff. So basically there’s this guy in akpsi who happens to be my little that has had classes or whatever with tristyn and they became close. they developed feelings for each other and like it was obvious but tristyn didn’t wanna tell me how she felt so she didn’t hurt me. a month or so goes by and all of the sudden this guy like verbally attacks tristyn out of the blue saying she’s fake and she’s only trying to get at him to get back at me and all this other like awful shit and like says awful things behind her back to jason about how he only wants sex from her, etc. so the next week she talks to me about it all including the feelings part and i was basically just there for her bc she got attacked by this guy and was visibly shaken up by it and also told her that she shouldn’t feel the need to not tell me that kinda stuff but i appreciated her looking out for me. so this was all last term, spring term comes around and like the first night the next day jason my friend from last year(u guys met him, asian one who we had a falling out) texts me in the morning something along the lines of “damn kevin really fucked tristyn last night” and i was like what... (one bc he sent it at like 7am so it was just weird and two bc like did tristyn actually fuck this narc) so i confronted tristyn about it bc i was like wtf and she was like it “just happened”. next night, they hookup again and the night before tristyn was like apologetic bc she felt bad for some reason and was like super apologetic and then i got mad bc she clearly didn’t feel that bad. so basically this term has just been her kinda being shady or lying and then i get hurt by them
5/11/19, 10:52 PM - Parker: And that’s like the extremely shrunken version lol
5/11/19, 10:52 PM - Parker: and the first time she lied it was bc she didn’t wanna hurt me but since then i told if nothing else i want honesty from you and the same things happened a couple other times
5/11/19, 10:54 PM - Parker: and it’s especially shitty bc this is the guy who basically verbally assaulted her and she cried to me when i was there for her
5/11/19, 10:58 PM - Matt Casali: First thing I wanna say is that there are so many cases of people being caught in a relationship where someone is abusive verbally, emotionally, physically whatever and it's hard for them to get out of it. Theres a lot of things going on there that might be influencing her decisions. But, even though that might be the case, from what I know about your relationship and your feelings towards tristyn, you dont owe her your friendship here if its gonna be costing you your emotional well-being
5/11/19, 10:59 PM - Matt Casali: I'm an increasingly big proponent of dumping people if they're being bad to you
5/11/19, 10:59 PM - Matt Casali: Like in a repeating way
5/11/19, 10:59 PM - Matt Casali: Like it seems like she is being for you
5/11/19, 11:01 PM - Darren: That's a hell of an abbreviation
5/11/19, 11:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: It sounds like she’s hiding things from you and acting in ways that she anticipates will cushions your feelings, but overall feels disingenuous. Is that accurate?
5/11/19, 11:05 PM - Parker: Spot on
5/11/19, 11:05 PM - Parker: you’re telling me haha
5/11/19, 11:05 PM - Parker: and yeah matt i get where your coming from
5/11/19, 11:05 PM - Parker: and you’re far from the first person to tell me that
5/11/19, 11:06 PM - Matt Casali: What do you think is keep you from doing that
5/11/19, 11:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: Jesus this isn’t the default
5/11/19, 11:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: Conversation first
5/11/19, 11:08 PM - Darren: The fact that this drama is between him and his frats co exec and his little makes it extremely tied to his role/membership in the frat
5/11/19, 11:08 PM - Parker: No jason i’ll answer
5/11/19, 11:08 PM - Parker: bc matt idk whether it’s my subconscious or me actively choosing but i want her as a friend
5/11/19, 11:09 PM - Parker: she’s arguably my closest friend at oregon, ignoring the feelings we had toward each other
5/11/19, 11:09 PM - Parker: like i’ve tried so hard to make it work bc she has been such a big part of my life here and so impactful to my college experience
5/11/19, 11:09 PM - Parker: as cheesy as that sounds
5/11/19, 11:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: No those are good reasons
5/11/19, 11:11 PM - Parker: and there’s probably been two legitimate times this term where i legitimately considered doing that
5/11/19, 11:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: What changed your mind?
5/11/19, 11:13 PM - Parker: mostly the above reasons
5/11/19, 11:13 PM - Parker: and a little space helps
5/11/19, 11:13 PM - Matt Casali: What do you mean???
5/11/19, 11:14 PM - Matt Casali: She may be a big part because you're spending a lot of time worrying about her
5/11/19, 11:14 PM - Matt Casali: It's like I was talking about Fredi earlier: she was such a big part of my life until she wasnt
5/11/19, 11:14 PM - Matt Casali: Sometimes relationships just aren't worth it to pursue
5/11/19, 11:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: Sometimes that’s true
5/11/19, 11:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: We don’t know enough tho
5/11/19, 11:15 PM - Darren: Distance is an unaddressed (but not necessarily paramount) factor here
5/11/19, 11:16 PM - Parker: there’s more to our relationship than that though
5/11/19, 11:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: ^
5/11/19, 11:18 PM - Matt Casali: But it's the most important and impactful part apparently
5/11/19, 11:19 PM - Parker: yes
5/11/19, 11:19 PM - Parker: but it wasn’t at one point and i’m trying to get it back to that i guess
5/11/19, 11:19 PM - Matt Casali: I'm very very distant from all of this and I feel like it's easier said than done but that relationship is not worth it imo
5/11/19, 11:19 PM - Parker: it’s fluctuated for sure
5/11/19, 11:19 PM - Matt Casali: That's impossible my friend
5/11/19, 11:20 PM - Matt Casali: Relationships evolve but they very rarely go back to the way they started
5/11/19, 11:20 PM - Matt Casali: You're still gonna have the impact of the past year or so on your friendship
5/11/19, 11:20 PM - Matt Casali: I mean I guess you might be able to reach a point where you're just friends and you can look past it
5/11/19, 11:21 PM - Matt Casali: Just doesnt seem like it's a large possibility
5/11/19, 11:22 PM - Parker: ^
5/11/19, 11:22 PM - Matt Casali: ^
5/11/19, 11:22 PM - Parker: obviously i know it’ll never be like it was last april or may
5/11/19, 11:23 PM - Matt Casali: And was it even good then?
5/11/19, 11:23 PM - Matt Casali: Seemed like a lot of drama iirc
5/11/19, 11:23 PM - Parker: Last year?
5/11/19, 11:23 PM - Parker: 10%
5/11/19, 11:23 PM - Parker: 100*
5/11/19, 11:23 PM - Matt Casali: Really
5/11/19, 11:23 PM - Parker: no before any of that
5/11/19, 11:23 PM - Parker: april and may
5/11/19, 11:23 PM - Parker: like before we knew we liked each other
5/11/19, 11:23 PM - Matt Casali: Didnt something happen with her and Jason that rose tensions or something
5/11/19, 11:24 PM - Matt Casali: That I get
5/11/19, 11:24 PM - Darren: If she hadn't fucked your little and started acting shady, how do you think your friendship would have evolved? Do you think it would have normalized by now?
5/11/19, 11:24 PM - Parker: Yeah that was at the very end of the school year
5/11/19, 11:24 PM - Matt Casali: But everything after that was messy
5/11/19, 11:24 PM - Parker: yes
5/11/19, 11:24 PM - Parker: maybe not normalized and we’ve talked about that but atleast be in a good place
5/11/19, 11:24 PM - Parker: normal as can be friends
5/11/19, 11:24 PM - Jason Greenberg: How specifically did she react when you called her bluff for apologizing?
5/11/19, 11:26 PM - Parker: i don’t remember too much from that talk but i know in that day span i said some harsher things to her about it all that i wouldn’t have normally said and i could tell when we talked that she took it to heart
5/11/19, 11:26 PM - Parker: especially from me
5/11/19, 11:26 PM - Parker: or atleast realized that she actually hurt me
5/11/19, 11:28 PM - Jason Greenberg: Like harsh in an honest way or in a different way?
5/11/19, 11:28 PM - Matt Casali: I realize it's hard to take what I say entirely seriously with my "big statements" and what-not but I want you to seriously consider what your life would look like if you distanced yourself from tristyn. I've made myself clear on what I think is the best course of action so I dont think it helps to say anymore, but just take a little time to think about taking that action.
5/11/19, 11:30 PM - Parker: I’ve take. time on it and i’ll probably continue too, it’s part of why this term has been so shitty
5/11/19, 11:30 PM - Parker: like it’s not fun to have other people tell me to dump her
5/11/19, 11:35 PM - Darren: As a mild counterpoint to Matt's experience, my relationship with Christine had it's fair share of heavily documented shitty parts. When I was still dating her, I often thought about if I'd be happier without her and starting over.

When she dumped my ass hard, I got to see what that was like. I didn't have to deal with a lot of the shitty parts that felt like a huge deal then, but now that it's gone I miss it. I think I'd be some degree happier if things hadn't ended the way they did, and I feel like a post relationship friendship could have been really good for me. 

Clear cut, decisive action is great if you can reliably move past it and look forward more than you look backwards at what you had. Sometimes, space will make you realize how stupid you were for leaving... but sometimes it makes you realize you were right
5/11/19, 11:36 PM - Darren: This is also jaded by the fact that matt evolved the way he looks at relationships after his breakup and I did not
5/11/19, 11:38 PM - Parker: I get that though darren
5/11/19, 11:38 PM - Parker: not the same degree obviously
5/11/19, 11:38 PM - Parker: to the*
5/11/19, 11:39 PM - Parker: i think the underlying shitty thing for me is like 98% of the time i’ve been there for tristyn, especially when this dude made her cry, and then she goes and does these things
5/11/19, 11:39 PM - Parker: and sure the fact that they’re hooking up definitely bugs me and i’ve expressed that but it’s the lying or just being shady that bugs me more
5/11/19, 11:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: In hope of your relationship I would say think of anything you haven’t said that you wish you could communicate and just say it. Results may vary but you’ll feel a lot better about yourself. I am sorry too because it seems imbalanced and I know you’re such a good guy and she’s being shady
5/11/19, 11:42 PM - Parker: Yeah i’ve honestly done that for the first time. Something i’ll add is that this situation has brought me to say certain things to her that i normally wouldn’t have said for whatever reason, and some of it is pent up stuff from the summer and some of it is just things i feel strongly about and i’ve been harsh about it
5/11/19, 11:43 PM - Parker: Which has been refreshing
5/11/19, 11:43 PM - Parker: And we’re close enough where i don’t feel weird or feel like anything is off limits to say
5/11/19, 11:45 PM - Vaughn: Hows your relationship with her at this very second?
5/11/19, 11:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: Great! That’s definitely something to feel good about, even if you think you need to calibrate a bit and not overdo it
5/11/19, 11:47 PM - Parker: i’d say okay at best
5/11/19, 11:48 PM - Parker: it was a lot better last week c we talked and she was honest about a lot of stuff and i felt better but then something else happened
5/11/19, 11:48 PM - Parker: and it was like a setback
5/11/19, 11:49 PM - Vaughn: Are you thinking about the next thing to say to her? Cause if its on the edge righy now, overthinking can be suuper draining
5/11/19, 11:53 PM - Vaughn: Thanks for sharing pman, sorry its been shitty but from what i read your taking the right steps to figuring it all out
5/12/19, 12:59 AM - Tim Ko: Ya thx for sharing man! You have such a genuine heart for your friends and that’s very admirable. I hope that u can take these experiences and use it to grow as a person (like for me, I felt like I grew even though my relationship was short and shitty lol). I think you’ll look back upon this time and think, damn that was a shitty time but you’ll learn a lot from it!
5/12/19, 5:33 AM - Parker: Eh not particularly we’ve already had multiple conversations and i’ve said most of what i’ve wanted to, it’s just kinda on me at this point to move past things if i want to and she said she will be more honest and straight up going forward and that i kinda just have to trust she will
5/12/19, 5:33 AM - Parker: which she hasn’t given much reason to do that as of late
5/12/19, 7:45 AM - Ricky: Damn pman, this is rough
5/12/19, 7:45 AM - Ricky: I’m sorry :(
5/12/19, 7:48 AM - Ricky: I think one thing that you’ve probably already vocalized in some capacity, and is a hard thing to tell someone. But in a podcast I listen to they talk about in situations like this: the trystin person in the relationship who has don’t something or is doing something wrong then she thinks not telling you and avoiding it is to “help you and respect your feelings” but that’s not at all the case, she doing that to avoid having to face all the actions she is taking and it’s hurting you more than it’s helping
5/12/19, 7:49 AM - Ricky: Also, this isn’t necessarily the same situation and if it is would be hard to verbalize, but it seems clear to you that her lying isn’t helping much
5/12/19, 7:50 AM - Ricky: Idk what this really added, more just restating things but hope you’re doing okay pman
5/12/19, 8:34 AM - Jason Greenberg: Is this Jake and Amir?
5/12/19, 8:57 AM - Ricky: Yessir
5/12/19, 11:25 AM - Parker: no it summed things up fairly well
5/12/19, 11:25 AM - Parker: taking into account what you know
5/12/19, 11:27 AM - Parker: the other layers to it too are that i know deep down she really does care about me but i’ve told her her actions don’t always show it and i’ve heard from multiple people that at times last term she felt her feelings coming back and like at her formal she said something to our friend maddy about how she wished i was with her and stuff like that
5/12/19, 11:27 AM - Parker: so that just makes it harder
5/12/19, 11:53 AM - Jason Greenberg: That sounds hard
5/12/19, 12:44 PM - Tim Ko: Damn bro
5/12/19, 12:44 PM - Tim Ko: She graduating tho soon right?
5/12/19, 12:57 PM - Parker: she’s a senior so yeah
5/12/19, 12:57 PM - Parker: it really is
5/12/19, 12:57 PM - Parker: and we’ve talked about and mutually agreed that like some feelings will always be there so it makes it hard and that’s definitely part of why space helps
5/12/19, 1:03 PM - Jason Greenberg: If you've found that to be a good way to cope, it also explain why being so intertwined in each others friend groups would add difficulty to the problem
5/12/19, 1:09 PM - Parker: it definitely helps just hearing that we’re kinda on the same page with that stuff
5/12/19, 1:09 PM - Tim Ko: I see so do u think next year will be easier then? Since like she won’t be there anymore
5/12/19, 1:10 PM - Parker: I mean yeah i assume so but the fact that she’s graduating makes it hard bc we’ve had a good friendship and we’ve been so close this last year and a bit and i don’t wanna end of bad terms
5/12/19, 1:10 PM - Parker: I think that’s partly why i’m trying so hard to make things better bc i know we have limited time
5/12/19, 1:11 PM - Tim Ko: I see for sure
5/12/19, 1:12 PM - Tim Ko: I think it’s good that ur doing what ur doing then, being there for her
5/12/19, 1:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: It puts things in perspective
5/12/19, 1:42 PM - Parker: yeah it’s just gotten increasingly harder and harder to be there for her bc i feel like it’s not reciprocated some of the time
5/12/19, 1:42 PM - Parker: and i understand we are two different people when it comes to that stuff and emotions, etc but i don’t think it’s that hard to show some compassion every one in awhile
5/12/19, 1:43 PM - Parker: like what matt and darren andnjason we’re talking about yesterday
5/12/19, 1:48 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah I definitely agree with u
5/12/19, 2:23 PM - Parker: ^
6/23/19, 8:46 PM - Collin Hurst: You know when you see a really cute girl in public and then you can't muster up the cahones to talk to her and then she's gone forever

6/23/19, 9:14 PM - Alex Starr: Tim has a collage
6/23/19, 9:35 PM - Matt Casali: There's an app for that
6/23/19, 9:40 PM - Alex Starr: For Asian nuns in As caps?
2/11/20, 3:43 PM - Tim Ko: <Media omitted>
2/11/20, 3:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ah shit haha
2/11/20, 3:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: It was clear after the results last year you regretted it
2/11/20, 3:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: If it's any consolation you probably dodged a poly sci major
2/11/20, 3:48 PM - Tim Ko: Ya
2/11/20, 3:49 PM - Collin Hurst: Lmao
2/11/20, 3:49 PM - Tim Ko: Hahaha, nah she wants to do MD Ph D.
2/11/20, 3:50 PM - Tim Ko: Also she’s a freshman so that’s the biggest qualms I have
2/11/20, 3:52 PM - Alex Starr: She’s voted
2/11/20, 3:52 PM - Alex Starr: She’s adulting way harder than you haha
2/11/20, 3:53 PM - Alex Starr: Plus wants to do a PhD
2/11/20, 3:53 PM - Alex Starr: Even if it is medical
2/11/20, 4:10 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah but in about 3 months, Berkeley is about to be in the past
2/11/20, 4:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: Damn try the veal
2/11/20, 4:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: If you had the opportunity to date someone for 3 months only, would you?
2/11/20, 4:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: jc
2/11/20, 4:34 PM - Parker: Lol
2/11/20, 4:34 PM - Parker: No
2/11/20, 4:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: If I was single I’d be in the yes camp
2/11/20, 4:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: So much can happen in just a month
2/11/20, 4:51 PM - Collin Hurst: Yes
2/11/20, 4:51 PM - Parker: Well if we’re talking about in real life now then maybe i’d date someone until graduation if there was a chance we end up in the same place after but if it’s a hard cutoff no matter what at 3 months then no
2/11/20, 4:52 PM - Collin Hurst: Nothing's a hard cutoff
2/11/20, 4:52 PM - Parker: He said 3 months only though
2/11/20, 4:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: 3 months only
2/11/20, 4:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: I guess factoring in graduation on the horizon it seems like a bad time to start but you might still have a great experience
2/11/20, 4:54 PM - Parker: I would say yes until graduation
2/11/20, 4:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: The downsides would be time away from real friends
2/11/20, 4:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: Unless you date your best friend
2/11/20, 4:55 PM - Parker: Speaking of dates, pman has one tomorrow! gang
2/11/20, 4:59 PM - Ricky: AYYYYYY
2/11/20, 4:59 PM - Ricky: GANG GNQNG SNA GN
2/11/20, 4:59 PM - Ricky: who with!
2/11/20, 5:02 PM - Jason Greenberg: Gang gang!!
2/11/20, 5:02 PM - Jason Greenberg: ^
2/11/20, 5:23 PM - Matt Casali: Have you dtr with julia yet?
2/11/20, 5:51 PM - Parker: This girl Britnee (another fun spelling for you guys) who’s in akpsi
2/11/20, 5:53 PM - Darren: The nee of Justice!!!
2/11/20, 5:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: Damn I’m excited for you!
2/11/20, 5:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: What’s the plan?
2/11/20, 5:55 PM - Parker: we’re getting coffee then going to a park i think
2/11/20, 5:55 PM - Parker: Lol
2/11/20, 5:57 PM - Alex Starr: Idk I’m not coming up with anything for britnee
2/11/20, 5:57 PM - Alex Starr: Other than bad need-based puns
2/11/20, 6:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: Cute
2/11/20, 6:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: Make sure you memorize some Akpsi trivia in case she asks
2/11/20, 6:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh wait
2/11/20, 6:21 PM - Tim Ko: LETS GOOOO GANG GNAG
2/11/20, 6:21 PM - Tim Ko: it’s ur time pman
2/11/20, 6:21 PM - Tim Ko: Let us know how it goes!
2/11/20, 6:22 PM - Tim Ko: If I liked them enough then I would.
2/11/20, 6:24 PM - Tim Ko: I also think partly why I don’t want to is cuz I kinda want to see what’s out there (cuz I’ll be having a ton of new experiences in the future) and I’m not into her enough to not see what’s out there
2/11/20, 6:25 PM - Tim Ko: So I feel like if I date her and then met someone I really like, I’d jump ship and to me that’s not what I want my relationship to look like
2/11/20, 6:26 PM - Tim Ko: ^also this
2/11/20, 6:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: That’s very fair
2/11/20, 7:04 PM - Parker: Oh true i’ll prepare
2/12/20, 5:42 PM - Parker: Update: it went well! For context, this is a girl that ive known for awhile through mutual friends and admitted last term to me that she had been into me and ive always thought she was cute but never have had a real crush on her
2/12/20, 5:42 PM - Parker: but weve spent a decent amount of time together since through akpsi stuff and whatnot
2/12/20, 5:42 PM - Darren: Likely for a round 2?
2/12/20, 5:43 PM - Parker: so it was more to clear the air i guess then to get to know her but it went well
2/12/20, 5:43 PM - Parker: I said that im down to keep it chill but am hesitant to put myself in a place where i could catch feelings bc of past events and how much i have going on in my life rn
2/12/20, 5:44 PM - Parker: And she was pretty much on the same page
2/12/20, 5:44 PM - Parker: which i wasnt sure if she would considering she admitted that shes actually into me
2/12/20, 5:45 PM - Darren: Fun stuff
2/12/20, 5:45 PM - Darren: This was a coffee date?
2/12/20, 5:56 PM - Parker: yeah
2/12/20, 5:58 PM - Matt Casali: Very cool parker, seems pretty chill
2/12/20, 6:01 PM - Ricky: Ayyyy congrats pman
2/12/20, 6:01 PM - Ricky: Sounds like a good mature time
2/12/20, 6:05 PM - Tim Ko: Ayyy that’s awesome parker
2/12/20, 6:05 PM - Tim Ko: Is she from the bay?
2/12/20, 6:05 PM - Tim Ko: Ur year?
2/12/20, 7:09 PM - Vaughn: Is it karli?
2/12/20, 7:20 PM - Parker: Portland
2/12/20, 7:20 PM - Parker: yeah senior
2/12/20, 7:20 PM - Parker: Hehe no
2/12/20, 8:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: Haha
2/12/20, 8:20 PM - Jason Greenberg: Good job big boi
3/2/20, 12:42 AM - Collin Hurst: Just had the graduation future plans talk with Julia
3/2/20, 12:42 AM - Collin Hurst: Tis a rough one
3/2/20, 12:52 AM - Collin Hurst: Cause she has gotten attached and I haven't
3/2/20, 1:09 AM - Vaughn: Damn
3/2/20, 1:10 AM - Vaughn: Howd the talk go?
3/2/20, 1:27 AM - Collin Hurst: Not very well
3/2/20, 1:27 AM - Collin Hurst: Got down to the inevitable what's the point
3/2/20, 6:43 AM - Parker: oof
3/2/20, 6:57 AM - Matt Casali: Nooo, I'm sorry collin
3/2/20, 6:58 AM - Matt Casali: The point imo is to have a good time with each other while you can
3/2/20, 6:59 AM - Matt Casali: But what's gonna happen with you guys now?
3/2/20, 8:12 AM - Parker: ^
3/2/20, 8:12 AM - Parker: people are always so concerned with what’s ahead, just enjoy the present
3/2/20, 8:32 AM - Matt Casali: Yeah, unless of course you're not enjoying it
3/2/20, 8:33 AM - Matt Casali: And I also realize that it's much easier said then done and it's even harder if it's hard for her to do as well
3/2/20, 9:13 AM - Tim Ko: :((( damn bud I’m sorry
3/2/20, 12:14 PM - Ricky: Sorry bud :(
3/2/20, 12:14 PM - Ricky: But I’m proud of you for doing the convo at all
3/2/20, 12:18 PM - Collin Hurst: Thanks peeps
3/2/20, 12:19 PM - Collin Hurst: I've always imaging traveling/going to Denver by myself and she didn't really expect that
3/2/20, 12:19 PM - Darren: Did she expect to move to denver?
3/2/20, 12:19 PM - Collin Hurst: No, staying in california
3/2/20, 12:20 PM - Collin Hurst: But that's just not worth it in my opinion, especially when I've only known her for a couple months, 6 by the time I leave
3/2/20, 12:20 PM - Darren: Oh, did she want to do distance?
3/2/20, 12:26 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah she assumes that whenever you decide to make it official that you are in it for the long haul
3/2/20, 12:26 PM - Collin Hurst: Which for me is no
3/2/20, 12:28 PM - Tim Ko: U guys made it official recently?
3/2/20, 12:29 PM - Collin Hurst: yeah a month ago
3/2/20, 12:32 PM - Darren: Where does that leave the two of you now?
3/2/20, 12:32 PM - Collin Hurst: she hasn't said anything
3/2/20, 12:43 PM - Tim Ko: How are u feeling about all this?
3/2/20, 12:43 PM - Ricky: Dang, that is rough, I’m sorry Ching
3/2/20, 12:43 PM - Ricky: Collin*
3/2/20, 12:44 PM - Collin Hurst: hahaha ching gdmi
3/2/20, 12:44 PM - Tim Ko: Hahaha
3/2/20, 12:44 PM - Ricky: Better discuss now and have time to think it over rather than just say bye when it comes to it
3/2/20, 12:44 PM - Tim Ko: I was like, damn ricky
3/2/20, 12:44 PM - Ricky: Hahahaha my b
3/2/20, 12:47 PM - Collin Hurst: it sucks that she feels so attached, but the pain now is far better than the pain of long distance/breaking up at graduation
3/2/20, 12:48 PM - Collin Hurst: you know me i have a lack of sensitivity about the whole thing
3/2/20, 12:48 PM - Ricky: I mean, it’s not unreasonable for someone you are officially dating to be attached haha
3/2/20, 12:48 PM - Matt Casali: I dont think so
3/2/20, 12:48 PM - Matt Casali: I think you two just want different things
3/2/20, 12:49 PM - Matt Casali: And you gotta evaluate now if those can work together or not
3/2/20, 12:49 PM - Matt Casali: And yes haha
3/2/20, 12:50 PM - Collin Hurst: It was hard to put forward the fact that she's not special enough to do long distance with without hurting her feelings, cause thats pretty much what it is. To be fair tho, I don't think anyone would be special enough for that at this point in my life
3/2/20, 12:50 PM - Matt Casali: Which is very very important to say I think
3/2/20, 12:50 PM - Tim Ko: This is 100% fair
3/2/20, 12:50 PM - Ricky: True, I think it’s deff good you said it, and depending on how you did it can heavily influence her response but no matter what, it makes sense she’d be upset
3/2/20, 12:51 PM - Tim Ko: I think u can word it better tho lol
3/2/20, 12:51 PM - Tim Ko: In a more gentle way
3/2/20, 12:51 PM - Ricky: “Listen hun, ya not worth it”
3/2/20, 12:51 PM - Tim Ko: For sure
3/2/20, 12:51 PM - Tim Ko: Haha
3/2/20, 12:52 PM - Tim Ko: U can just say ur not the type to do long distance
3/2/20, 12:52 PM - Matt Casali: No just say that you feel like this transition is going to be made so much harder by a long distance relationship
3/2/20, 12:52 PM - Matt Casali: Well he has been, so that would be a lie
3/2/20, 12:53 PM - Matt Casali: Like maybe if you guys were closer it wouldn't be bad, but it's literally two states over
3/2/20, 12:53 PM - Tim Ko: I mean if ur ending it, it really doesn’t matter what the exact exact reason is
3/2/20, 12:54 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah but she doesn't deserve to be lied to about his reasons. Why not just be honest about it?
3/2/20, 12:54 PM - Matt Casali: And I mean of course you gotta consider yourself Collin
3/2/20, 12:54 PM - Tim Ko: Cuz if he straight up told her she’s not special enough, it hurts even more?
3/2/20, 12:54 PM - Ricky: Tell her you wouldn’t be able to come visit her much, but then fly home and hang with us every other weekend
3/2/20, 12:55 PM - Tim Ko: And he can just say, at this stage in my life I don’t wanna do long distance
3/2/20, 12:55 PM - Tim Ko: Not lying
3/2/20, 12:55 PM - Tim Ko: Not 100% truthful
3/2/20, 12:55 PM - Matt Casali: I mean it's hard too, cause she seems to obviously have a different view of distance as was seen from driving from Davis for a date
3/2/20, 12:55 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah I think that's better
3/2/20, 12:55 PM - Matt Casali: And what I was trying to say
3/2/20, 12:56 PM - Tim Ko: For sure
3/2/20, 12:56 PM - Ricky: Trueeee I forgot about that
3/2/20, 12:58 PM - Parker: Very true
3/2/20, 12:58 PM - Parker: this
3/2/20, 12:59 PM - Collin Hurst: thing is it would be a fly home then drive to davis with my nonexistent car
3/2/20, 12:59 PM - Ricky: Totally makes sense
3/2/20, 1:00 PM - Ricky: I 100% believe it makes to end it ftr
3/2/20, 1:00 PM - Ricky: Just peppering in jokes
3/2/20, 1:00 PM - Collin Hurst: i don't get it lol
3/2/20, 1:02 PM - Tim Ko: Oh I totally did not read the end of this lmao
3/2/20, 1:03 PM - Ricky: Yeah nvm sry, I’ll chill
3/2/20, 1:03 PM - Ricky: But I think you did the right thing Collin, proud of you for being mature about it even though it sucks rn
3/2/20, 1:04 PM - Collin Hurst: Ye
3/2/20, 1:05 PM - Alex Starr: Was absolutely the right thing
3/2/20, 1:06 PM - Matt Casali: ^
3/2/20, 1:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: This is true
3/2/20, 1:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: Based on how you feel, the difficulty playing out makes sense
3/2/20, 1:09 PM - Darren: Matt you need to calm down the fucking honesty
3/2/20, 1:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: Sorry this is a tough my man
3/2/20, 1:09 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lol
3/2/20, 1:09 PM - Alex Starr: I read that as “you need to calm down the fucking honestly” and was somewhat shook
3/2/20, 1:10 PM - Darren: The fact that Collin has done long distance makes him more able than average to say he doesn't want to do it again
3/2/20, 1:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh very true
3/2/20, 1:23 PM - Parker: I read it as “matt you need to calm the fuck down honestly” lol
3/2/20, 1:24 PM - Collin Hurst: Lol
3/4/20, 12:31 PM - Collin Hurst: Well Julia and i done but we will probably hang out as friends
3/4/20, 12:31 PM - Collin Hurst: And I are done *
3/4/20, 12:31 PM - Darren: What does that mean
3/4/20, 12:32 PM - Ricky: Aw sorry bud
3/4/20, 12:32 PM - Darren: ^
3/4/20, 12:32 PM - Vaughn: :(((
3/4/20, 12:32 PM - Ricky: But glad you can still be friends maybe
3/4/20, 12:32 PM - Tim Ko: Damn I’m sorry collin :((
3/4/20, 12:32 PM - Vaughn: Sounds like she handled it well, well done collin that mustve been tough
3/4/20, 12:32 PM - Matt Casali: I'm sorry Collin
3/4/20, 12:32 PM - Collin Hurst: Yeah it really sucks, I enjoy my time with her but I don’t think I was as ready as she was for a relationship and that hurt her
3/4/20, 12:33 PM - Collin Hurst: But she also understands
3/4/20, 12:33 PM - Matt Casali: I think it was good for you to be honest about that
3/4/20, 12:33 PM - Matt Casali: Both for yourself and her
3/4/20, 12:33 PM - Darren: Yeah, honesty never hurt anyone
3/4/20, 12:33 PM - Parker: Aw sorry collin
3/4/20, 12:33 PM - Matt Casali: In the long run
3/4/20, 12:33 PM - Parker: ^
3/4/20, 12:33 PM - Darren: You did good Collin
3/4/20, 12:33 PM - Parker: Better that way than the other
3/4/20, 12:33 PM - Tim Ko: Very mature of u  collin
3/4/20, 12:34 PM - Collin Hurst: I can’t just have her on a leash hoping that my feelings will change and want to do long distance
3/4/20, 12:34 PM - Collin Hurst: It’s not fair
3/4/20, 12:35 PM - Matt Casali: Especially if she wasn't willing to accept that you didn't want it now and may not want it in the future
3/4/20, 12:36 PM - Tim Ko: Definitely, I think you did the right thing
3/4/20, 12:36 PM - Tim Ko: If u ever want a pick me up, I’m down to play Minecraft whenever!
3/4/20, 12:36 PM - Tim Ko: :)
3/4/20, 12:37 PM - Ricky: ^^
3/4/20, 12:41 PM - Parker: or get a ps4 and buy 2k
3/4/20, 12:43 PM - Matt Casali: boooooo
3/4/20, 1:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: Aw man I’m sorry Collin
3/4/20, 1:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: I also echo everyone here in saying it was good you were honest and better now than later
3/17/20, 12:19 AM - Parker: Even though it was v v casual, britnee kinda broke things off tn :(
3/17/20, 12:19 AM - Parker: just a slight :(
3/17/20, 12:20 AM - Darren: :/
3/17/20, 12:31 AM - Darren: Because you're coming home?
3/17/20, 12:32 AM - Collin Hurst: Aw man:(
3/17/20, 12:41 AM - Tim Ko: Damn bro :((
3/17/20, 12:42 AM - Parker: No bc of another guy apparently lol
3/17/20, 12:43 AM - Ricky: Aw man I’m sorry pman
3/17/20, 12:43 AM - Parker: he spilled his feelings to her and she’s looking for a relationship and said is a very relationship-y person and i’m just not looking for that rn
3/17/20, 12:43 AM - Parker: Or wanted it more chill
3/17/20, 12:44 AM - Parker: i mean it’s chill like we’re still friends and cool
3/17/20, 12:44 AM - Ricky: Gotcha glad y’all know what you want :)
3/17/20, 12:47 AM - Parker: but like also kinda a bummer haha
3/17/20, 12:48 AM - Darren: Given corona, were you going to see her later anyway?
3/17/20, 12:52 AM - Parker: I mean i’m still planning on going back in two weeks so probably but who knows
3/17/20, 12:52 AM - Parker: she was freaking out about it but i’m sure i’ll be back sooner than later
3/17/20, 12:53 AM - Darren: That's what Niki and I thought
3/17/20, 1:13 AM - Tim Ko: Did u hang out with her a lot parker?
3/17/20, 6:18 AM - Parker: Not a lot but a decent amount
3/17/20, 6:19 AM - Parker: but definitely not as much as she wanted
3/17/20, 8:36 AM - Jason Greenberg: Aw sorry pman
3/17/20, 8:51 AM - Matt Casali: :( sorry parker
3/17/20, 8:51 AM - Matt Casali: What's happening with you guys?
3/17/20, 1:55 PM - Darren: That's a great question
3/17/20, 2:03 PM - Matt Casali: :/
3/17/20, 2:07 PM - Tim Ko: Did she have any post grad plans yet?
3/17/20, 4:00 PM - Darren: She was gonna go back to SD after graduation, but was gonna come back to UCSC fall quarter to finish one of her majors
3/17/20, 4:21 PM - Jason Greenberg: Does she think fall is unlikely?
3/17/20, 4:40 PM - Darren: Alright folks, here's the rundown:

We both have talked about going back home after graduation (me to the bay and her to SD), but we haven't explicitly talked about post grad plans. It felt kind of implied that we'd split after graduation and that our relationship is a great short term thing with no need to go beyond that. We had even talked about Collin/Julia's breakup and Niki disagreed with Julia's opinion of relationships only being long term commitments and took Collin's side (as did I). 

I've been operating under the assumption that we were gonna break up after graduation - either mine or hers - and I hadn't decided which graduation would be the time to do it. Recently, I had been leaning towards hers because things have been going well. 

She was very confident that she would be coming back for spring quarter, so we didn't talk about the "what if this is the end of times" scenario where she doesn't come back. Now that that's happening, it is unclear what exactly is going to happen between us and where she stands on the whole thing. She needs to come back to Santa Cruz to move out of the dorms (before April 6th when they start charging rent), so she was planning on coming up and staying with me for a few days before leaving for San Diego for good. I figured we'd talk about it then.

So far, we've been talking as if things are normal between us. The whole pandemic has really fucked up her plans (academically, sports wise, losing the end of senior year, etc), so I've been trying to support her through this. Maybe with all the disruption, now is not the best time for me to bow out of the equation.

I am adverse to doing long distance in the long run, but I'm perfectly OK with doing long distance for the medium term and continuing our relationship for the time being. I need to talk to her more about this, but with finals it's been difficult to find time. Any option she picks, I think I'm alright with it.
3/17/20, 4:41 PM - Darren: Also, it's looking like she won't even be allowed to travel up to Santa Cruz to move out her stuff anyway
3/17/20, 4:42 PM - Darren: Here's a question: is your relationship considered healthy if it dies to Corona?
3/17/20, 4:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: Seems like you’ve got a handle on it
3/17/20, 4:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: I can see that it’s a bit touchy tho I hope things go smooth
3/17/20, 4:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: Keep us updated
3/17/20, 4:49 PM - Darren: Will do
3/17/20, 4:51 PM - Ricky: Damn, that’s rough, sorry big D
3/17/20, 4:51 PM - Ricky: Corona is probably gonna kill lots of relationships tbh, so much required change in a short time
3/17/20, 4:52 PM - Darren: At least I'm not one of the couples in China who filed for divorce right after quarantine was lifted hahaha
3/17/20, 4:53 PM - Ricky: Jesus hahaha, true true
3/17/20, 4:53 PM - Darren: Yeah, ultimately I'm not too stressed about this. Its just something that needs to be addressed eventually
3/17/20, 7:14 PM - Tim Ko: Sounds like u are in a good place, being at peace with whatever decision :))
3/17/20, 7:14 PM - Tim Ko: I didn’t hear about this lmaooo
3/19/20, 11:40 AM - Darren: Apparently Niki bought me a birthday gift, which is something you don't do if you're thinking about breaking things off soon
3/19/20, 11:40 AM - Darren: Will investigate further
3/19/20, 11:40 AM - Collin Hurst: Eh she’s a friend!
3/19/20, 11:40 AM - Darren: I don't make friends, Collin
3/19/20, 11:40 AM - Collin Hurst: As well as whatever else
3/19/20, 11:40 AM - Collin Hurst: It’s a nice gesture
3/19/20, 11:40 AM - Darren: True
3/19/20, 11:40 AM - Tim Ko: Awww that’s so sweet!
3/19/20, 11:41 AM - Matt Casali: Nice :)
3/19/20, 11:41 AM - Jason Greenberg: Ooo
3/19/20, 1:40 PM - Vaughn: So I confessed my feelings to my long time crush last night
3/19/20, 1:40 PM - Vaughn: It went really well boys
3/19/20, 1:40 PM - Darren: Oh fuuuuuck
3/19/20, 1:40 PM - Darren: Explain
3/19/20, 1:41 PM - Jason Greenberg changed the subject from "Sex & Relationships" to "Sex & Relationships 🍵"
3/19/20, 1:41 PM - Vaughn: Ive been getting really close to this girl, it felt like the right time
3/19/20, 1:41 PM - Vaughn: And god shes amazing
3/19/20, 1:42 PM - Vaughn: Turns out shes had feelings for me too
3/19/20, 1:42 PM - Jason Greenberg: Bro
3/19/20, 1:42 PM - Vaughn: And the timings weird
3/19/20, 1:42 PM - Vaughn: But everything was just so, comfortable
3/19/20, 1:43 PM - Vaughn: We've got a date lined up for when she gets back
3/19/20, 1:43 PM - Matt Casali: VAUGHN!!! YESSSS
3/19/20, 1:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: That's dope!
3/19/20, 1:43 PM - Matt Casali: I'm so happy that it went well
3/19/20, 1:44 PM - Vaughn: Its surreal
3/19/20, 1:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: That is a nice thing in all this
3/19/20, 1:44 PM - Vaughn: Yeah
3/19/20, 1:44 PM - Vaughn: Corona helped believe it or not
3/19/20, 1:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: This was all in person?
3/19/20, 1:45 PM - Collin Hurst: Yayy Vanessa
3/19/20, 1:45 PM - Collin Hurst: I assume
3/19/20, 1:45 PM - Vaughn: Yessir
3/19/20, 1:45 PM - Vaughn: To both
3/19/20, 1:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: Gang
3/19/20, 1:45 PM - Matt Casali: It would have been a plot twist if it wasnt haha
3/19/20, 1:45 PM - Collin Hurst: Gang gang
3/19/20, 1:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: Are you gonna get to see her again?
3/19/20, 1:46 PM - Vaughn: Yes, shes coming back
3/19/20, 1:47 PM - Vaughn: But a bit ago it was uncertain, so it kinda got me the nerve to go for it
3/19/20, 1:47 PM - Alex Starr: Nice
3/19/20, 1:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: Diamond balls nice
3/19/20, 1:48 PM - Tim Ko: Ayyy let’s go vaughn
3/19/20, 1:48 PM - Tim Ko: Excited for u!
3/19/20, 1:54 PM - Vaughn: Thanks guys 😊
3/19/20, 2:46 PM - Parker: Aww vaughn that’s makes me happy!!
3/19/20, 2:47 PM - Parker: that*
3/22/20, 3:08 PM - Tim Ko: Parker : ya know that’s a good question. I told her initially  with everyone going on in my life and finding a job/school along with the uncertainty of life beyond june, a relationship wasn’t a priority in my life at the time and i was more down to keep things chill but now that she kinda said some other guy opened up to her and wants something more along the lines of what she wants (a relationship) it’s bummed me out a bit
3/22/20, 3:08 PM - Tim Ko: Bc she’s cool and we went on a couple dates and have had fun together
3/22/20, 3:09 PM - Tim Ko: Darren : Bummed to the point of second guessing your decision?
3/22/20, 3:10 PM - Tim Ko: Awww that’s rlly cool! Yeah she commented on ur insta and so I clicked on her profile and she’s pretty cute parker :)
3/22/20, 4:02 PM - Parker: Maybe a bit but also idk. It’s tough bc even if i did want to date her now or down the road i’d still want to get to know her more and hangout with her in more of that context but that shop may have sailed
3/22/20, 4:02 PM - Parker: ship*
3/22/20, 4:03 PM - Parker: but also maybe not
4/3/20, 2:08 PM - Vaughn: Hayleys moving in?!
4/3/20, 2:08 PM - Vaughn: Thats dope
4/3/20, 2:08 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lol
4/3/20, 2:09 PM - Alex Starr: Elaborate
4/3/20, 2:10 PM - Jason Greenberg: The plan has been to quarantine for the long haul in the same place. She finished quarantining for 2 weeks after flying home from Puerto Rico and now she’s coming here (to Gil’s place in mv) for the foreseeable future
4/3/20, 2:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: No symptoms, no contact with others besides us
4/3/20, 2:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: Not the idealest of ideals but we plan on staying reasonably put
4/3/20, 2:12 PM - Jason Greenberg: At this point we’ve been apart for double our usual time I’m excited to see her
4/3/20, 2:15 PM - Alex Starr: That sounds like a win
4/3/20, 2:15 PM - Parker: That’s awesome jason i’m glad you get to be with her
4/3/20, 2:15 PM - Matt Casali: That's so cool jason, I'm happy for you
4/3/20, 2:15 PM - Parker: Either a good thing or the start of a horror movie where she actually has and infects your whole family
4/3/20, 2:15 PM - Parker: jk jk
4/3/20, 2:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: It’s gonna be a practice run before getting an apartment without parents in it later this year
4/3/20, 2:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: Honestly a possibility!! Lol
4/3/20, 2:21 PM - Darren: Good to have parental training wheels at first
4/3/20, 2:32 PM - Matt Casali: ^
4/3/20, 5:38 PM - Tim Ko: Yoo nice jason!!
4/3/20, 6:03 PM - Ricky: Ayyyyy that’s lit jason!
4/3/20, 6:04 PM - Ricky: You still gotta play Jack box with us though!
4/3/20, 6:17 PM - Collin Hurst: ^
6/4/20, 12:30 PM - Jason Greenberg: Guys it’s bad
6/4/20, 12:31 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hayley wants to drive her sister and her friends to a protest and potentially protest herself and I don’t want her to bc I don’t want either of us getting exposed to other people
6/4/20, 12:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: I support the cause but I don’t want to take part in the protests bc we’re in a pandemic
6/4/20, 12:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: She’s real upset
6/4/20, 12:33 PM - Alex Starr: Sorry to hear that
6/4/20, 12:33 PM - Alex Starr: Had a similar discussion with my sister, but she was pretty easy to convince because she was just on the fence about it
6/4/20, 12:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ah man
6/4/20, 12:33 PM - Matt Casali: It's not an easy situation
6/4/20, 12:34 PM - Matt Casali: Just comes down to how important the issue is to you I guess
6/4/20, 12:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hayley is in the camp of I’ve weighed the risks and it’s the right thing to do
6/4/20, 12:34 PM - Matt Casali: I agree with her
6/4/20, 12:34 PM - Jason Greenberg: Which is something that would be fine for her to take part in but she’s putting me at risk now too
6/4/20, 12:35 PM - Matt Casali: But also it's difficult because if you dont feel comfortable with it then you shouldn't have to be exposed too
6/4/20, 12:35 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah
6/4/20, 12:35 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah
6/4/20, 12:35 PM - Jason Greenberg: She says she won’t do anything I don’t want her to but she’s like crying and crying in the other room it’s intense
6/4/20, 12:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: I either have to live with crushing her or go against my fundamental belief to not contribute to the spread of the pandemic
6/4/20, 12:36 PM - Alex Starr: It’s also hard because it’s so emotionally charged. Trying to make an argument probably just comes off as cold or indifferent
6/4/20, 12:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah! I feel like she sees me like that
6/4/20, 12:37 PM - Jason Greenberg: It’s tough
6/4/20, 12:38 PM - Alex Starr: I’m pretty firmly in the camp of protesting is a bad idea, but don’t really have anything to offer outside of logical arguments
6/4/20, 12:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: Logical arguments like?
6/4/20, 12:38 PM - Alex Starr: Given the pandemic odds of any actual change are slim
6/4/20, 12:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: I could use any help I could get
6/4/20, 12:39 PM - Matt Casali: Like I said earlier, I think it's a difference in opinion on how important the protest is. I'd address that before anything else.
6/4/20, 12:39 PM - Alex Starr: Here’s one that’ll be popular: you can be pretty sure cops will do something awful once the pandemic is over.  Wait til then to protest
6/4/20, 12:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ok yeah top of my list
6/4/20, 12:40 PM - Alex Starr: But mostly the fact that given the pandemic it is unlikely that real change will be possible
6/4/20, 12:41 PM - Alex Starr: My sister wound up donating some money she had saved up, which obviously isn’t a super idea given you guys just struck out on your own, but it might go a long way to try to do something else that isn’t protest.
6/4/20, 12:41 PM - Parker: that’s a good one, but also maybe one that she wouldn’t wanna hear given how emotional it’s been
6/4/20, 12:41 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah I was being sarcastic about the popular part lol
6/4/20, 12:42 PM - Matt Casali: Donating is a good thing to do too
6/4/20, 12:42 PM - Matt Casali: Protest would be better imo but donating is a good compromise
6/4/20, 12:42 PM - Alex Starr: Why do you think protest is better?
6/4/20, 12:42 PM - Alex Starr: I’m curious what you think the goal of protesting is/what it will accomplish
6/4/20, 12:43 PM - Alex Starr: Even posting on social media might be helpful
6/4/20, 12:43 PM - Alex Starr: Just to show that you do care
6/4/20, 12:43 PM - Parker: Yeah i was gonna say jason if you can convince that for the time being there are more effective ways to impact the cause
6/4/20, 12:44 PM - Parker: Because at this time, there are many more effective things you can do then protest imo
6/4/20, 12:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: I lead with there are other ways to impact the cause
6/4/20, 12:44 PM - Matt Casali: Donating and protesting are both forms of solidarity but one requires you to actually show up and be present with others who are protesting with you
6/4/20, 12:45 PM - Matt Casali: It's a much different feeling for you and a physical protest is always going to be more productive
6/4/20, 12:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: Didn’t say better ways and we’ve been operating under the assumption that protesting is the best way bc I don’t have evidence atm that could beat her argument in favor of it
6/4/20, 12:45 PM - Matt Casali: Like what?
6/4/20, 12:45 PM - Alex Starr: Donating imo
6/4/20, 12:45 PM - Matt Casali: What's her argument?
6/4/20, 12:45 PM - Parker: I think donating
6/4/20, 12:45 PM - Parker: for one
6/4/20, 12:45 PM - Matt Casali: Why not both?
6/4/20, 12:46 PM - Parker: Bc were in a pandemic
6/4/20, 12:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: Something along these lines is her argument
6/4/20, 12:46 PM - Alex Starr: Right but Matt what does the protesting actually do.  I’m not saying it does nothing, I just can’t figure it out
6/4/20, 12:46 PM - Matt Casali: Theres a lot of historical examples haha
6/4/20, 12:46 PM - Alex Starr: No I know
6/4/20, 12:46 PM - Parker: I think giving to an organization whose mission is to fight this cause or similar causes does much more than having your voice heard in the street
6/4/20, 12:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: It’s difficult to say what is the best thing to do
6/4/20, 12:46 PM - Darren: Jason can you move back into your parents house for 2 weeks and let her protest then quarantine in your apartment?
6/4/20, 12:47 PM - Parker: Im not denying that protesting can be v effective i just mean at this very moment
6/4/20, 12:47 PM - Alex Starr: But like protesting for a particular law, but like what would be the demands
6/4/20, 12:47 PM - Alex Starr: This
6/4/20, 12:47 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah I'm not going for my individual voice to be heard
6/4/20, 12:47 PM - Matt Casali: Mostly just to be another body and another voice
6/4/20, 12:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: It would be a real rough choice but not a non zero probability
6/4/20, 12:48 PM - Alex Starr: And this is always an incredibly unpopular argument, but other places are being destroyed by the pandemic and desperately need donations too
6/4/20, 12:48 PM - Parker: your voice meaning collective voice
6/4/20, 12:48 PM - Alex Starr: For what? What specific action do you want taken?
6/4/20, 12:48 PM - Parker: Or contributing to the collective voice
6/4/20, 12:48 PM - Parker: also true
6/4/20, 12:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah I tried to bring up the idea that it’s very difficult to ascertain what the most important cause is to support. She did not like it
6/4/20, 12:49 PM - Matt Casali: I've heard calls from black folks and organizers for the abolishment of the police or at least drastic reforms to their oversight
6/4/20, 12:49 PM - Matt Casali: I'm sure there's sources from BLM giving actual demands
6/4/20, 12:49 PM - Parker: yeah that’s a hard one to convince her of
6/4/20, 12:50 PM - Alex Starr: Abolishment of police seems strong, but yes changes in training make total sense
6/4/20, 12:50 PM - Matt Casali: Changes in training haven't really done anything
6/4/20, 12:50 PM - Alex Starr: And I’d forgotten about that it’s a good point
6/4/20, 12:50 PM - Alex Starr: Well I mean more changes/changes in oversight
6/4/20, 12:50 PM - Matt Casali: In the case of Minneapolis they had diversity trainings and all that shit in 2016 back during the Ferguson riots
6/4/20, 12:51 PM - Alex Starr: I was kinda lumping oversight in with training
6/4/20, 12:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh that would be real bad as far as I can tell. Police are necessary for maintaining order obviously but yeah an overhaul in training is certainly warranted
6/4/20, 12:51 PM - Alex Starr: Perhaps making it annual
6/4/20, 12:51 PM - Alex Starr: Unrelated, Bangladesh/Africa are so fucked
6/4/20, 12:51 PM - Matt Casali: Pretty sure it is
6/4/20, 12:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: If changes to our education system have not helped close the international gap, should we abolish education?
6/4/20, 12:51 PM - Matt Casali: https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2020/06/police-abolition-george-floyd/ you guys should check this out
6/4/20, 12:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: I think there’s room for further iterating
6/4/20, 12:52 PM - Parker: yeah i think abolishing the police is strong
6/4/20, 12:53 PM - Matt Casali: I think the police force is an inherently flawed institution. It doesn't really serve black people unless they're in power and even then it still manages not to.
6/4/20, 12:53 PM - Matt Casali: I've read a lot of Angela Davis and her theories on prison abolition and it kinda seems like police and prison abolition go hand in hand
6/4/20, 12:53 PM - Matt Casali: Not a lot of Angela davis just one of her books
6/4/20, 12:55 PM - Alex Starr: Read the article some, while I agree decriminalizing various drugs and minor offenses is good, straight abolishment seems not so good
6/4/20, 12:56 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah I think this is the general mindset of the protests
6/4/20, 12:56 PM - Matt Casali: Which is good and I'd take that over nothing
6/4/20, 12:56 PM - Alex Starr: They also did not really give a what will happen with straight abolishment scenario for larger crimes
6/4/20, 12:56 PM - Matt Casali: They kind of did for murder
6/4/20, 12:57 PM - Alex Starr: But Jason, I think that trying to show solidarity in some other way would be useful.  A sign in the window would be a good start.
6/4/20, 12:57 PM - Alex Starr: They did?
6/4/20, 12:57 PM - Matt Casali: Ye
6/4/20, 12:57 PM - Alex Starr: I guess I just wasn’t satisfied with that answer
6/4/20, 12:57 PM - Matt Casali: Fair
6/4/20, 12:57 PM - Jason Greenberg: I agreed to go with her to a car caravan protest next week
6/4/20, 12:58 PM - Jason Greenberg: I think it’s all-or-nothing thinking going on
6/4/20, 12:58 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah and you could always help by disseminating info on social media
6/4/20, 12:58 PM - Matt Casali: Reading and such
6/4/20, 12:58 PM - Matt Casali: If hayley or you want I got a good list of books that has been going around
6/4/20, 12:58 PM - Matt Casali: With links to pdfs
6/4/20, 12:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: I read the article it was lacking in any specific statistics. Saying that something produces no effect requires specific statistics
6/4/20, 12:59 PM - Alex Starr: Ah okay.  But putting up a sign yourself doesn’t hurt.  Might not make an immediate impact but in a couple days it could indirectly help
6/4/20, 1:00 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah it’s a decent idea
6/4/20, 1:00 PM - Matt Casali: I think its more trying to provide an answer to the statistics proving that its harmful
6/4/20, 1:00 PM - Matt Casali: It's one imagination of another solution to crime, there's probably a lot more
6/4/20, 1:01 PM - Vaughn: Here's the best resource I've stumbled upon
6/4/20, 1:01 PM - Vaughn: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-0KC83vYfVQ-2freQveH43PWxuab2uWDEGolzrNoIks/mobilebasic
6/4/20, 1:01 PM - Darren: Suspicious
6/4/20, 1:02 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah I think we are saying it didn’t seem like a complete solution
6/4/20, 1:02 PM - Darren: There's no way this isn't a thanos penis
6/4/20, 1:02 PM - Vaughn: Im not 13
6/4/20, 1:02 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah I’m not gonna click through
6/4/20, 1:02 PM - Matt Casali: This is good, but I would suggest buying books from black authors that are still alive
6/4/20, 1:03 PM - Matt Casali: Just to support
6/4/20, 1:03 PM - Tim Ko: Jason maybe u could have her quarantine in a room in ur apartment?
6/4/20, 1:03 PM - Matt Casali: Unless you dont have the means to buy the book but I assume that you all do
6/4/20, 1:03 PM - Tim Ko: Do have multiple rooms?
6/4/20, 1:04 PM - Tim Ko: Also I think the protests are the most usueful way to bring awareness and cause change.
6/4/20, 1:04 PM - Matt Casali: https://www.versobooks.com/books/2426-the-end-of-policing
6/4/20, 1:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: It would be tough with shared applicants. But mostly it would suck to be in the same apartment doing that
6/4/20, 1:05 PM - Alex Starr: The quarantine in a room is 
1. Awful.
2. Not that effective.
6/4/20, 1:05 PM - Matt Casali: If anyone wants to read more on police abolition
6/4/20, 1:05 PM - Matt Casali: I would guess it's a lot more in depth
6/4/20, 1:06 PM - Alex Starr: I feel like police abolition isn’t going to happen, so aiming for some lower hanging fruit might be a good idea
6/4/20, 1:06 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah for sure
6/4/20, 1:07 PM - Matt Casali: Going for police abolition will yield lower hanging fruit along the way
6/4/20, 1:07 PM - Tim Ko: It’s definitely much better than not quarantining. I’ve seen some cases where families live with someone who has COVID 19 but it doesn’t spread to them
6/4/20, 1:09 PM - Alex Starr: I also disagree with the abolition thing
6/4/20, 1:09 PM - Alex Starr: So that’s probably a factor
6/4/20, 1:09 PM - Matt Casali: Haha yeah prob
6/4/20, 1:09 PM - Alex Starr: Jason let us know how it goes, hope it works out well.
6/4/20, 1:10 PM - Tim Ko: ^
6/4/20, 1:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’ll keep you guys updated
6/4/20, 1:11 PM - Jason Greenberg: Not feeling optimisitic
6/4/20, 1:13 PM - Parker: ^
6/4/20, 1:13 PM - Alex Starr: Oh that’s not good.  Be more optimistic!
6/4/20, 1:14 PM - Tim Ko: Also just as a thought on the risks, there is a small chance that she will catch COVID, and even if she does, not guaranteed to pass on to u (if u take precaution), if u get it, decent chance u have no symptoms, and if u do, very high chance u recover in a couple weeks
6/4/20, 1:15 PM - Darren: Small chance she catches covid seems like an understatement
6/4/20, 1:15 PM - Alex Starr: But if everyone does it...
6/4/20, 1:15 PM - Alex Starr: It’s the littering at a beach.  Come on it’s one water bottle it’ll be fine.
6/4/20, 1:16 PM - Tim Ko: Yeah, not saying u should or shouldn’t but saying u should weight that with how much u two really want to fight for this cause
6/4/20, 1:17 PM - Alex Starr: Again if everyone does it...
6/4/20, 1:17 PM - Tim Ko: True
6/4/20, 1:17 PM - Tim Ko: Then we’ll finally see the change we need lol
6/4/20, 1:18 PM - Alex Starr: Mass infection and death?
6/4/20, 1:18 PM - Tim Ko: And not everyone is doing it
6/4/20, 1:18 PM - Tim Ko: If we’re gonna be real
6/4/20, 1:18 PM - Alex Starr: The irony of predominantly African American protests resulting in the deaths of countless African Americans from COVID?
6/4/20, 1:18 PM - Tim Ko: Not even a quarter of America is doing it
6/4/20, 1:18 PM - Ricky: IMO i bet it’s hard because Hayley has been talking with her friends about it a lot and they probably convinced her to go
6/4/20, 1:18 PM - Alex Starr: It’s obviously an oversimplification
6/4/20, 1:19 PM - Collin Hurst: you guys could go hold signs on a street corner, that would be safer and you would have more of an individual impact
6/4/20, 1:20 PM - Alex Starr: True
6/4/20, 1:21 PM - Matt Casali: That disproportionate amount is part of the systemic injustice that the protests are fighting against
6/4/20, 1:22 PM - Alex Starr: I meant disproportionate caused by African Americans protesting
6/4/20, 1:22 PM - Vaughn: I think having a dialogue about the issue with your family and other people close to you has a much bigger impact than posting on social media or standing on a street corner
6/4/20, 1:22 PM - Alex Starr: I recognize the other reasons for it being disproportionate
6/4/20, 1:22 PM - Matt Casali: Well it was disproportionate before
6/4/20, 1:22 PM - Matt Casali: Oh okay
6/4/20, 1:22 PM - Alex Starr: See later comment
6/4/20, 1:22 PM - Tim Ko: Also imagine if no protests happened, like no one would even remember george Floyd rn
6/4/20, 1:23 PM - Matt Casali: True true
6/4/20, 1:23 PM - Alex Starr: Like all the people starving all over the world
6/4/20, 1:23 PM - Tim Ko: It would have just been another “unfortunate circumstance”
6/4/20, 1:23 PM - Collin Hurst: well people protest and hold signs so that people do have that dialogue
6/4/20, 1:23 PM - Tim Ko: ^
6/4/20, 1:23 PM - Matt Casali: I agree
6/4/20, 1:23 PM - Matt Casali: Both are good though
6/4/20, 1:24 PM - Matt Casali: Going to a protest is better
6/4/20, 1:24 PM - Alex Starr: Disagree
6/4/20, 1:24 PM - Alex Starr: COVID isn’t a joke
6/4/20, 1:24 PM - Alex Starr: Donating is better
6/4/20, 1:24 PM - Matt Casali: Neither is the disregard for black lives
6/4/20, 1:25 PM - Matt Casali: It's not an easy decision for a lot of people to make
6/4/20, 1:25 PM - Alex Starr: Lol I had that after my donating is better comment and got so confused
6/4/20, 1:25 PM - Tim Ko: I think to a point tho, like I think now we have the capacity of protests where it has national attention, so for us, it would be more effective at this point to have dialogue like vaugh said
6/4/20, 1:25 PM - Tim Ko: And donate alike Alex said
6/4/20, 1:25 PM - Tim Ko: And those other stuff
6/4/20, 1:25 PM - Matt Casali: But protests are tiring for those who participate and it requires constant action from a lot of different people to actually keep on going
6/4/20, 1:26 PM - Alex Starr: For me it’s always that 1000 dollars in Bangladesh saves lives, 1000 dollars here might lead to minor reform when combined with thousands of other donations
6/4/20, 1:26 PM - Vaughn: Yeah words spread enough that everyone knows, the last thing we want is for everyone to think theyre doing enough/know enough
6/4/20, 1:26 PM - Matt Casali: I think the main point here is that the protests need to keep happening and the momentum needs to keep up
6/4/20, 1:26 PM - Tim Ko: Yes I agree
6/4/20, 1:26 PM - Matt Casali: Otherwise its just gonna be like Ferguson where everyone stopped talking about it
6/4/20, 1:26 PM - Matt Casali: Well not everyone
6/4/20, 1:26 PM - Alex Starr: Disagree, ending protests is good.  COVID is the real enemy
6/4/20, 1:26 PM - Tim Ko: I think if it starts dying then it would be more effective to go to one
6/4/20, 1:27 PM - Alex Starr: Obviously racism is an enemy as well, but COVID moreso
6/4/20, 1:27 PM - Tim Ko: Fair
6/4/20, 1:27 PM - Matt Casali: To you
6/4/20, 1:27 PM - Matt Casali: Racism is killing a whole lot of people
6/4/20, 1:28 PM - Alex Starr: Racism is disproportionately killing people of particular races, I’m not sure it’s actively increasing a body count by a large amount
6/4/20, 1:28 PM - Matt Casali: I could imagine that being black and being under the constant fear (amplified now) of being attacked by police and killed is a little more visceral than catching covid
6/4/20, 1:28 PM - Vaughn: There are definitely more logical/ideal ways to protest that could keep everyone safe and keep a decent amount of momentum, i dont think a covid vs protest debate could ever be settled though
6/4/20, 1:28 PM - Collin Hurst: i think I'm leaning on the side of no (physical) protest, looking at the numbers of deaths that could spike from COVID after the gatherings
6/4/20, 1:29 PM - Collin Hurst: I feel like there could be a good way to use the media
6/4/20, 1:29 PM - Tim Ko: That would be an interesting research
6/4/20, 1:29 PM - Tim Ko: Like would media be effective
6/4/20, 1:29 PM - Matt Casali: I think there was gonna be a spike because of efforts to reopen before this anyway
6/4/20, 1:29 PM - Tim Ko: There is no history to base that on since this is a new age of mass media
6/4/20, 1:29 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah but the protests will exacerbate it greatly
6/4/20, 1:30 PM - Collin Hurst: I'm just surprised by the number of people I've talked to that have excess trump stimulus money and go to protests but haven't donated
6/4/20, 1:30 PM - Matt Casali: Another solution to just stopping protests is that the government responds to the demands and acts on them
6/4/20, 1:30 PM - Matt Casali: Protest would die down
6/4/20, 1:30 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah but we don’t have direct control of that
6/4/20, 1:31 PM - Collin Hurst: that's the dream
6/4/20, 1:31 PM - Matt Casali: Because we haven't protested enough
6/4/20, 1:31 PM - Tim Ko: Just a thought, but what if this leads to big change like civil rights movement and saves more lives in the future compared to COVID right now
6/4/20, 1:31 PM - Vaughn: Lets say the US hits the second wave of cases soon, could we effectively postpone these protests for when its safe again?
6/4/20, 1:31 PM - Matt Casali: That's my idea
6/4/20, 1:31 PM - Alex Starr: All I’m saying is wait for the whole pandemic thing to die down
6/4/20, 1:31 PM - Matt Casali: Well not mine
6/4/20, 1:32 PM - Matt Casali: The BLM's idea
6/4/20, 1:32 PM - Vaughn: The more we protest now, the more time we'll have to wait for covid to die down again
6/4/20, 1:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: Here's a couple articles that try to balance both sides
6/4/20, 1:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/06/protests-pandemic/612460/
6/4/20, 1:32 PM - Jason Greenberg: newyorker.com/science/medical-dispatch/how-the-protests-have-changed-the-pandemic
6/4/20, 1:32 PM - Alex Starr: Okay I’m also saying there are larger issues
6/4/20, 1:32 PM - Tim Ko: I don’t think COVID is dying  down for us to resume “normal” life until we get a vaccine
6/4/20, 1:33 PM - Matt Casali: So if there was no covid would y'all go?
6/4/20, 1:33 PM - Darren: Yes
6/4/20, 1:33 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yeah
6/4/20, 1:33 PM - Matt Casali: That's good
6/4/20, 1:33 PM - Vaughn: Yup
6/4/20, 1:33 PM - Alex Starr: Honestly probably not
6/4/20, 1:33 PM - Matt Casali: We knew that haha
6/4/20, 1:33 PM - Alex Starr: I mean
6/4/20, 1:33 PM - Collin Hurst: maybe
6/4/20, 1:34 PM - Alex Starr: I have gone to protests before
6/4/20, 1:34 PM - Matt Casali: I think the idea then is, what changed from 2016 to now to make you wanna go?
6/4/20, 1:34 PM - Matt Casali: Like there was protests in solidarity with Ferguson
6/4/20, 1:34 PM - Tim Ko: I went to UC Berkeley
6/4/20, 1:34 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
6/4/20, 1:35 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah part of it for me is going to ucsc
6/4/20, 1:35 PM - Vaughn: Living in sc
6/4/20, 1:35 PM - Darren: Going to UCSC may have made me more anti protest than before I attended
6/4/20, 1:36 PM - Collin Hurst: ^
6/4/20, 1:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: The front-y bit on my brain is more developed. And also 4 years of a million bajillion changes. I think causation is a tough argumetn
6/4/20, 1:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: or rather this thing is it
6/4/20, 1:36 PM - Vaughn: I definitely agree for smaller issues
6/4/20, 1:36 PM - Vaughn: Fuck those protests
6/4/20, 1:36 PM - Matt Casali: Ugh
6/4/20, 1:37 PM - Matt Casali: I'm not saying causation, just that there was a lot of political and educational action in the past four years that informed a lot of people about social justice that would probably make them wanna go now
6/4/20, 1:38 PM - Matt Casali: Those were the results of protest
6/4/20, 1:38 PM - Jason Greenberg: Impossible to say something so specific imo
6/4/20, 1:38 PM - Collin Hurst: I feel like the number of protests devalues other protests just cause of how many there are
6/4/20, 1:38 PM - Collin Hurst: not related to this blm one tho
6/4/20, 1:39 PM - Tim Ko: Lol
6/4/20, 1:39 PM - Matt Casali: And I think for me specifically, seeing the amount of people going to these protests in the face of police violence and covid has given me a lot of hope for how things might change and has made me more willing to protest
6/4/20, 1:39 PM - Jason Greenberg: blm getting plenty of attention I don't think the other protests are doing much to change that
6/4/20, 1:39 PM - Matt Casali: ^
6/4/20, 1:39 PM - Matt Casali: Also theres a lot of cooperation and solidarity between different movements
6/4/20, 1:39 PM - Darren: I think the overwhelming authoritarian response by police forces in every metropolitan area *feels* different and greater this year than it did in 2016, partially because of the history that 2016 and 2014 happened and nothing changed, partially because of the way it has overtaken covid as the nation's main concern
6/4/20, 1:39 PM - Matt Casali: Unless you're talking about the open up protests
6/4/20, 1:40 PM - Matt Casali: Very true
6/4/20, 1:41 PM - Collin Hurst: im also a little hopeless cause at the root its a cultural issue, which is so hard to fix
6/4/20, 1:41 PM - Alex Starr: COVID might help with that
6/4/20, 1:41 PM - Alex Starr: It kills old people mostly
6/4/20, 1:41 PM - Vaughn: Covid wont help systemic rascism thats for sure
6/4/20, 1:41 PM - Collin Hurst: maybe we're on to something, kill all the racist boomers with COVID
6/4/20, 1:42 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah that's fair, I think its gonna take a lot of time, people and work
6/4/20, 1:42 PM - Matt Casali: That's for dang sure
6/4/20, 1:43 PM - Matt Casali: And I mean it's a systemic one as well as a cultural one
6/4/20, 1:43 PM - Alex Starr: If it makes sure trump isn’t elected it could
6/4/20, 1:43 PM - Alex Starr: But there’s a lot of systemic progress
6/4/20, 1:43 PM - Alex Starr: Not so much cultural
6/4/20, 1:43 PM - Collin Hurst: i swear to god if trump gets re-elected...
6/4/20, 1:43 PM - Matt Casali: Biden is pretty bad in terms of race- did you guys hear his shooting comment?
6/4/20, 1:43 PM - Matt Casali: Trump is worse dont get me wrong
6/4/20, 1:43 PM - Matt Casali: But biden isnt gonna do shit about racism in the us
6/4/20, 1:44 PM - Alex Starr: Idk from what I’d seen he was handling it reasonably well
6/4/20, 1:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: no one is thrilled about biden it's his cabinet we want
6/4/20, 1:44 PM - Tim Ko: At this point, it would just be sad cuz some of his supporters are even criticizing him rn lol
6/4/20, 1:44 PM - Collin Hurst: just get Trump off
6/4/20, 1:44 PM - Darren: Buy your own damn furnishings
6/4/20, 1:44 PM - Jason Greenberg: idk if that's true we should check back in to this comment if he gets elected, also his cabinet def could
6/4/20, 1:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: honestly it's supreme court justices you should be worried about
6/4/20, 1:45 PM - Alex Starr: I feel obligated to yell climate change
6/4/20, 1:45 PM - Alex Starr: But am trying very hard not to
6/4/20, 1:45 PM - Collin Hurst: where's thunberg
6/4/20, 1:45 PM - Jason Greenberg: lol
6/4/20, 1:46 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah I would love for that to be true, but I really doubt his willingness to make reforms to the police
6/4/20, 1:46 PM - Alex Starr: I’d say ability is a bigger deal, or list of priorities
6/4/20, 1:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: did the alternative
6/4/20, 1:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: dude*
6/4/20, 1:46 PM - Jason Greenberg: would be so bad
6/4/20, 1:47 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah
6/4/20, 1:47 PM - Alex Starr: Like incalculably bad
6/4/20, 1:47 PM - Matt Casali: I know haha
6/4/20, 1:47 PM - Vaughn: That maybe it's just kinda a  fad that people are scared of it right now? Like I wouldn't worry about it too much
6/4/20, 1:47 PM - Matt Casali: By no means am I saying that i dont want biden over trump
6/4/20, 1:47 PM - Vaughn: Hopefully the trend continues lol
6/4/20, 1:48 PM - Alex Starr: Lol it gets me every time
6/4/20, 1:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: well the office aint gonna be empty
6/4/20, 1:48 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah but we had the opportunity to elect a candidate who would make change and we missed it :/
6/4/20, 1:48 PM - Matt Casali: I would take yang
6/4/20, 1:48 PM - Matt Casali: UBI is cool
6/4/20, 1:48 PM - Alex Starr: Whoa whoa
6/4/20, 1:48 PM - Jason Greenberg: YangGang rise up!!
6/4/20, 1:48 PM - Alex Starr: Biden will make change
6/4/20, 1:49 PM - Matt Casali: Yeah no doubt
6/4/20, 1:49 PM - Alex Starr: It may not be the change you want, but it’ll be change.  And I don’t think for example sanders would make as much change
6/4/20, 1:49 PM - Jason Greenberg: Idk if it works but I like that he's thinking about automation and he's v liberal on climate change
6/4/20, 1:50 PM - Matt Casali: It may have not been the change you want, but it would have been change
6/4/20, 1:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: Also listens to science 4 real
6/4/20, 1:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: Yanggang2024
6/4/20, 1:50 PM - Alex Starr: No I’m not sure it would happen.  He might’ve been bogged down in a big initiative
6/4/20, 1:51 PM - Matt Casali: Ocasio-Cortez 2028
6/4/20, 1:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: Oh jesus
6/4/20, 1:51 PM - Matt Casali: Aight I'm out haha
6/4/20, 1:51 PM - Collin Hurst: 6ix9ine 2020
6/4/20, 1:51 PM - Darren: Jason's admiration for Andrew Yang always puts a smile on my face
6/4/20, 1:52 PM - Vaughn: I dont think we'll make it to 2028 at this rate
6/4/20, 1:53 PM - Collin Hurst: can we all chip in for a doomsday bunker
6/4/20, 1:53 PM - Matt Casali: True true
6/4/20, 1:53 PM - Vaughn: I overheard something about trump cancelling the election, is that even a thing? Lol
6/4/20, 1:53 PM - Jason Greenberg: not possible
6/4/20, 1:53 PM - Alex Starr: Hopefully not but there will be some fuckery with mail in ballots
6/4/20, 1:53 PM - Vaughn: Thatd be divine intervention levels of bullshit
6/4/20, 1:53 PM - Matt Casali: Also for cool science fiction books you guys should read the dispossessed or dawn
6/4/20, 1:54 PM - Matt Casali: Very good
6/4/20, 1:54 PM - Vaughn: (Munchkin)
6/4/20, 1:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: ^
6/4/20, 1:54 PM - Matt Casali: Classic
6/4/20, 1:54 PM - Collin Hurst: no way election gets cancelled lol
6/4/20, 1:54 PM - Collin Hurst: that goes through congress, and the house of reps is Democratic haha
6/4/20, 1:55 PM - Vaughn: Lol good
6/4/20, 1:55 PM - Collin Hurst: also even if it was cancelled, his presidency would have to automatically end Jan 20,2021 and then Nancy Pelosi would be president
6/4/20, 1:55 PM - Alex Starr: Cancel it!!!!
6/4/20, 1:56 PM - Vaughn: !!!
6/4/20, 1:56 PM - Alex Starr: Spread COVID now people protest like mad
6/4/20, 1:56 PM - Vaughn: That'd be the greatest plot twist in the history books
6/4/20, 1:57 PM - Vaughn: And in Fall of 2020, everyone started making out with the police
6/4/20, 1:57 PM - Alex Starr: It’s a bold move cotton lets see if it pays off
6/4/20, 1:59 PM - Parker: No
6/4/20, 1:59 PM - Parker: Hahaha
6/4/20, 2:00 PM - Alex Starr: No comment has aged worse
6/4/20, 2:00 PM - Collin Hurst: r/agedlikemilk
6/4/20, 2:00 PM - Parker: i will aggressively look for jobs up north
6/4/20, 2:00 PM - Collin Hurst: parker lets buy a house in canada with a shared ice rink in the back
6/4/20, 2:01 PM - Parker: and it will never be surpassed
6/4/20, 2:01 PM - Collin Hurst: buy houses*
6/4/20, 2:01 PM - Parker: Super down
6/4/20, 2:01 PM - Alex Starr: Yeah move to Michigan so Democrats win there
6/4/20, 2:01 PM - Parker: get our own maple trees and brew our own syrup
6/4/20, 2:02 PM - Vaughn: <Media omitted>
6/4/20, 2:02 PM - Vaughn: r/nocontext
6/4/20, 2:02 PM - Collin Hurst: wrong zip code nice try
6/4/20, 2:03 PM - Collin Hurst: Identity theft is not a joke, Vaughn! Millions of families suffer every year!
6/4/20, 2:04 PM - Vaughn: Lol
6/4/20, 3:20 PM - Tim Ko: Gang gang
6/6/20, 5:59 PM - Darren: Jason how did the whole Haley protesting thing resolve?
6/6/20, 6:07 PM - Jason Greenberg: We good now. It was tense and we were in different rooms for a while, but she talked to some of her friends and realized that she couldn't ask me for what she was asking for and that my reasons were valid
6/6/20, 6:17 PM - Parker: that’s good!
6/6/20, 6:21 PM - Alex Starr: Nice!
6/6/20, 6:21 PM - Alex Starr: Glad to hear it
6/6/20, 6:21 PM - Alex Starr: Did u guys see UCSF offering free tests to protesters?
6/6/20, 7:12 PM - Parker: that’s awesome
6/6/20, 7:30 PM - Tim Ko: ^!
6/6/20, 7:59 PM - Matt Casali: In other news, sj protest was a really good experience and felt good to be at. I would recommend for anyone comfortable
6/6/20, 7:59 PM - Matt Casali: We didnt see any police
6/6/20, 8:02 PM - Ricky: Nice! Glad you enjoyed it! I know my sisters went to the mv one and they seemed to have a good time
6/6/20, 8:14 PM - Vaughn: I ran alongside the car caravan in sc yesterday, didnt have to stop at any lights yeehaw
6/6/20, 8:18 PM - Matt Casali: Haha nice nice
6/6/20, 8:19 PM - Jason Greenberg: Glad you went glad it was a good experience!
6/6/20, 8:19 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ahaha nice
6/6/20, 8:28 PM - Tim Ko: That’s dope!
6/23/20, 7:50 PM - Parker: anyone use hinge before?
6/23/20, 7:50 PM - Alex Starr: How would that work given distancing?
6/23/20, 7:51 PM - Matt Casali: Weird vibes
6/23/20, 7:51 PM - Matt Casali: Theres apparently a big shift in online dating
6/23/20, 7:51 PM - Parker: i mean can’t do much beyond messaging rn, i just mean in general
6/23/20, 7:51 PM - Matt Casali: Not sure how its gonna work out, but seems interesting
6/23/20, 7:51 PM - Parker: or socially distanced walks
6/23/20, 7:51 PM - Parker: Facetime dates, etc
6/23/20, 7:52 PM - Alex Starr: Oh makes sense
6/23/20, 7:52 PM - Parker: explain
6/23/20, 7:52 PM - Matt Casali: It just seemed super intense and serious compared to tinder
6/23/20, 7:53 PM - Parker: Ah yeah i can see that, it’s def more structured
6/23/20, 7:53 PM - Matt Casali: More for a relationship I think
6/23/20, 7:53 PM - Parker: but i think the point is so there are things to start a conversation
6/23/20, 7:53 PM - Parker: Like they have prompts and stuff
6/23/20, 7:53 PM - Alex Starr: How’s it work?
6/23/20, 7:54 PM - Matt Casali: There wasnt many people on it when I used it before
6/23/20, 7:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: Try it out
6/23/20, 7:54 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’ve heard some girls like it
6/23/20, 7:55 PM - Parker: You set up your profile but it gives you the chance to answer three prompts as well as put caption-type things on pictures
6/23/20, 7:56 PM - Parker: so you get more of a feel of their personality rather than tinder which is just pictures and a bio mainly
6/23/20, 7:56 PM - Parker: It definitely is geared more towards relationships
6/23/20, 7:56 PM - Matt Casali: As much of a feel for their personality as you can get from three questions
6/23/20, 7:57 PM - Parker: yeah haha
6/23/20, 7:57 PM - Parker: and you can like specific pictures or prompts and respond to them rather than just liking their profile generally
6/23/20, 8:02 PM - Darren: You can sum up Matt's personality in 3 questions
6/23/20, 8:04 PM - Alex Starr: No answers needed just the questions
6/23/20, 8:19 PM - Tim Ko: Sign me up!
6/23/20, 8:19 PM - Tim Ko: U trying it out parker?
6/23/20, 8:20 PM - Parker: yup
6/23/20, 8:56 PM - Tim Ko: Gang
6/23/20, 8:56 PM - Tim Ko: Let us know how it goes
6/23/20, 8:56 PM - Tim Ko: What kinda prompts u putting?
6/23/20, 8:57 PM - Tim Ko: U should ask, “what’s ur ideal myplayer build?”
6/23/20, 8:57 PM - Tim Ko: 😂😂
6/23/20, 8:57 PM - Alex Starr: If she says 5 foot 11 y baller, you’re in luck
6/23/20, 8:58 PM - Tim Ko: Nah u always want her to be slightly shorter
6/23/20, 8:58 PM - Tim Ko: 5’10 and a half
6/23/20, 8:59 PM - Parker: im trying to get matches tim
6/23/20, 8:59 PM - Parker: Lol
6/23/20, 8:59 PM - Tim Ko: Lolol
6/23/20, 8:59 PM - Parker: they have a list of preset you have to choose from
6/23/20, 8:59 PM - Tim Ko: Were u the one who showed me the pic of the guy who put is 2k player on his tinder? Lol
6/23/20, 9:00 PM - Parker: otherwise i still wouldn’t use that question
6/23/20, 9:00 PM - Parker: Haha i don’t think so😂
6/23/20, 9:00 PM - Parker: that’s funny though
6/23/20, 9:00 PM - Alex Starr: Gun to my head id say give me the bullet rather than use that question
6/23/20, 9:00 PM - Parker: given my main guy is a 7’1 black guy, that might not fly
6/23/20, 9:01 PM - Parker: Lmao
6/23/20, 9:05 PM - Tim Ko: Actually u can get good answers
6/23/20, 9:05 PM - Tim Ko: Cuz maybe she prefers an interior force
6/23/20, 9:06 PM - Tim Ko: Or she’s more for a sharpshooter
6/23/20, 9:06 PM - Tim Ko: Or she likes a 3 level finisher
6/23/20, 9:06 PM - Tim Ko: Or a 2 way playmaker
6/23/20, 9:08 PM - Ricky: Damn Tim, I didn’t know u new how to talk dirty like that 💦
6/23/20, 9:09 PM - Tim Ko: Just listing the 2k archetypes 😂

7/2/20, 8:40 AM - Matt Casali: Do you guys kiss your SOs in the morning before brushing your teeth?
7/2/20, 8:55 AM - Jason Greenberg: No I don’t kiss Hayley unless she has on a full face and if she’s isn’t wearing cute pajamas there’s no way
7/2/20, 8:55 AM - Darren: Not before I buy her dinner, no
7/2/20, 11:10 AM - Collin Hurst: Yeah
7/2/20, 11:11 AM - Ricky: Yeah haha do I know someone against it?
7/2/20, 11:12 AM - Darren: But only when it was Donya. Julia 1 and 2 did not get the VIP treatment
7/2/20, 11:12 AM - Matt Casali: I'm not against it
7/2/20, 11:12 AM - Parker: I was gonna say
7/2/20, 11:12 AM - Collin Hurst: But not like making out in the morning
7/2/20, 11:13 AM - Matt Casali: That's Juj's position
7/2/20, 11:14 AM - Darren: So if you're gonna have morning sex, it either has to be after brushing teeth or you're not making out? The fuck?
7/2/20, 11:15 AM - Ricky: I honestly have never noticed bad breath on grace and don’t find not brushing right when you wake up gross, so I go 0-100 pre brushing
7/2/20, 11:16 AM - Darren: ^ 
(But without the grace specific details)
7/2/20, 11:17 AM - Collin Hurst: It’s more about me I hate having morning breath
7/2/20, 11:17 AM - Collin Hurst: And just morning mouthfeel
7/2/20, 11:17 AM - Ricky: Are you saying you have noticed grace having bad breath?! You got a problem Dawson?
7/2/20, 11:17 AM - Collin Hurst: But I’m good to go after a sip of water
7/2/20, 11:19 AM - Darren: I have never found that to be a problem, no
7/2/20, 3:13 PM - Jason Greenberg: Matt why the quiry
7/2/20, 3:13 PM - Jason Greenberg: I hope it was to settle an argument
7/2/20, 3:14 PM - Ricky: ^^ I’m curious too
7/2/20, 3:15 PM - Vaughn: My guess is matt is in the same boat as ricky
7/2/20, 3:16 PM - Vaughn: Juj didnt want matts sticky tongue this morning
7/2/20, 3:16 PM - Ricky: Ewwwww, sticky
7/2/20, 3:22 PM - Tim Ko: Sticky Ricky
7/2/20, 3:28 PM - Matt Casali: ^
7/2/20, 3:28 PM - Matt Casali: Yes to settle an argument haha
7/2/20, 3:37 PM - Vaughn: Some may prefer the sticky tongue
7/2/20, 3:52 PM - Jason Greenberg: Ahaha
7/24/20, 8:12 PM - Darren: Apparently sex can cause your period to start early by a couple days
7/24/20, 8:13 PM - Vaughn: Ooof
7/24/20, 8:13 PM - Alex Starr: Had to change your pants?
7/24/20, 8:14 PM - Collin Hurst: Is this just a random fact or
7/24/20, 8:15 PM - Darren: After looking into it a little more, it's often a random factor or a symptom of something else like cancer or a bad STI
7/24/20, 8:16 PM - Alex Starr: How’d this come up?
7/24/20, 8:16 PM - Darren: But according to some Stanford doctor, if you have sex within 2 days of when your period is expected to start, an orgasm can cause the period to start early
7/24/20, 8:18 PM - Collin Hurst: ^ hello Darren answer
7/24/20, 8:21 PM - Darren: Because I had sex with Niki 2-3 days before her period was expected to start and the next day she started her period. And her birth control makes her period super regular, so the 1-2 day difference was unusual
7/24/20, 8:21 PM - Alex Starr: So you guys are still seeing each other or this was a while ago?
7/24/20, 8:21 PM - Darren: She just left my house back to socal this morning
7/24/20, 8:22 PM - Alex Starr: Oh nice
7/24/20, 8:23 PM - Matt Casali: Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
7/24/20, 8:25 PM - Collin Hurst: Saucy

7/26/20, 11:51 AM - Tim Ko: Wait did she go to mvhs?
7/26/20, 11:53 AM - Matt Casali: Hopefully this guy doesn't have a dick as his desktop background or else the wedding's off
7/26/20, 11:53 AM - Vaughn: Lol
7/26/20, 11:53 AM - Darren: She was the first chair clarinet at mvhs
7/26/20, 11:54 AM - Darren: ??

7/26/20, 11:55 AM - Matt Casali: Dweeblegobble prank that jason did and Eric got pissed
7/26/20, 11:55 AM - Parker: Lmaooo
7/26/20, 11:55 AM - Parker: she was in marching band too
7/26/20, 11:57 AM - Tim Ko: Wut
7/26/20, 11:58 AM - Tim Ko: I guess I just never talked to her
7/26/20, 11:58 AM - Darren: Wind ensemble
7/26/20, 11:58 AM - Tim Ko: Ohhh
7/26/20, 11:58 AM - Tim Ko: Ok makes sense
7/26/20, 11:58 AM - Tim Ko: I never made it that far 😂
7/26/20, 11:58 AM - Tim Ko: Lolol
7/26/20, 12:14 PM - Jason Greenberg: I’m not the man you’re looking for. I was sitting next to Daniel Bowers when he made Eric’s desktop background a penis. Hand to Jesus
7/26/20, 12:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: Then Eric said we broke his computer
7/26/20, 12:15 PM - Jason Greenberg: So much wrong with that statement
7/26/20, 12:16 PM - Vaughn: He was fumbling for excuses for why daniel crossed the line
7/26/20, 12:16 PM - Vaughn: He insisted their was a virus and also said something like, what if my girlfriend saw this
7/26/20, 12:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha oh yeah!!
7/26/20, 12:23 PM - Jason Greenberg: Instant dump hahaha
7/26/20, 12:27 PM - Collin Hurst: Lmao good memories
7/26/20, 12:30 PM - Parker: hahaha
7/26/20, 12:30 PM - Parker: atleast you didn’t accidentally knock water on to the laptop and break it
7/26/20, 12:58 PM - Tim Ko: Lolol
7/26/20, 12:59 PM - Tim Ko: Ok for real tho, like what if his parents saw it? Like I’m just imagining my 14 yr old self with a full blown penis background and if my parents opened it
7/26/20, 1:00 PM - Darren: Eric wasn't raised in a house of God
7/26/20, 1:00 PM - Matt Casali: I'd say, my 14 y/o friends thought a penis would be a funny thing to put on my desktop and they'd prob say sounds about right
7/26/20, 1:01 PM - Tim Ko: It’s be pretty embarrassing at the least
7/26/20, 1:01 PM - Tim Ko: I guess depending on ur parents
7/26/20, 1:01 PM - Tim Ko: Dave and Barry’s reaction would prob be to give a hi five
7/26/20, 1:14 PM - Vaughn: More like, "Ha! I told you Honey"
7/26/20, 1:15 PM - Alex Starr: Eyebrow raise
7/26/20, 1:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: To be fair I think Eric was like 18 when we were sophomores
7/26/20, 1:25 PM - Darren: Barry sighs, opens his wallet, and hands Laurakay a crisp $5 bill
7/26/20, 1:26 PM - Alex Starr: It’d definitely be a wadded you mess, if he had any.  I had to loan him cash yesterday haha
7/26/20, 1:27 PM - Alex Starr: Wadded up*
7/26/20, 1:43 PM - Jason Greenberg: Hahaha
7/26/20, 2:16 PM - Parker: Lol
7/26/20, 2:17 PM - Parker: Lucky he was raised the house and with parents that he did otherwise i would’ve had to pay for the laptop lol
7/29/20, 7:42 PM - Parker: I’m messaging this one girl on hinge and she seems chill but she has no joke put “LOL” in all caps in almost everyone of her messages😂
7/29/20, 7:42 PM - Parker: guess she laughs out loud THAT much
7/29/20, 7:42 PM - Collin Hurst: Wow
7/29/20, 7:43 PM - Collin Hurst: You never know I guess
7/29/20, 7:43 PM - Collin Hurst: Also wrong chat
7/29/20, 7:43 PM - Collin Hurst: Sorry to expose you
7/29/20, 7:43 PM - Parker: yeah it’s kind of a bummer
7/29/20, 7:43 PM - Parker: is there a right chat?
7/29/20, 7:43 PM - Collin Hurst: Tinder Co.
7/29/20, 7:44 PM - Collin Hurst: I don’t actually care though lol
7/29/20, 7:45 PM - Parker: that would be wrong too though
7/29/20, 7:45 PM - Parker: Unless it’s Dating Apps Co.
7/29/20, 7:45 PM - Collin Hurst: That’s pretty much what it is
7/29/20, 7:45 PM - Parker: Haha ik ik
7/29/20, 7:46 PM - Collin Hurst: Although you do see the weirdest shit on tinder
7/29/20, 7:46 PM - Darren: Rename it to 'Tinder and not Tinder'
7/29/20, 7:47 PM - Jason Greenberg: Lmaoo
7/29/20, 7:48 PM - Parker: done
7/29/20, 7:54 PM - Tim Ko: If anything it means she’s not emotionless lol
7/29/20, 7:55 PM - Darren: Or she's a robot
7/29/20, 7:55 PM - Alex Starr: Or is emotionless and trying to hide it
