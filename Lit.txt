4/21/20, 5:44 PM - Vaughn: Thanks rick ‚ù§ i realized ive been internalizing my longing feelings or all of you guys, i miss the hangouts a lot

4/28/20, 10:49 PM - Tim Ko: Minecraft sesh?
4/28/20, 10:51 PM - Collin Hurst: Not the sesh I was thinking
4/28/20, 11:00 PM - Parker: I already smoked and probably won‚Äôt again before bed :(
4/28/20, 11:00 PM - Parker: i‚Äôm down another night doe
4/28/20, 11:01 PM - Collin Hurst: dangit
4/28/20, 11:01 PM - Collin Hurst: okie sounds good
4/28/20, 11:01 PM - Collin Hurst: gotta do a legit one where it isnt just like 3 mins haha
4/28/20, 11:05 PM - Parker: and where it‚Äôs everyone haha
4/28/20, 11:05 PM - Collin Hurst: yea lol
4/28/20, 11:06 PM - Parker: the rest is gonna get their lit thoughts card revoked soon at this rate
4/28/20, 11:06 PM - Parker: are*
4/28/20, 11:06 PM - Collin Hurst: although that will be pretty hard considering we cant even get everyone when we're not smoking
4/28/20, 11:08 PM - Parker: Lol true
4/28/20, 11:09 PM - Parker: and this will be a lot easier if/when i go back to eugene haha
4/28/20, 11:14 PM - Collin Hurst: when that
4/28/20, 11:39 PM - Parker: hopefully soon
4/28/20, 11:39 PM - Parker: but idk
4/29/20, 10:41 AM - Ricky: I‚Äôm going back to school May 13/14
4/29/20, 10:41 AM - Ricky: So 100% can when I‚Äôm there
5/2/20, 12:08 AM - Collin Hurst: <Media omitted>
5/2/20, 4:32 AM - Parker: That‚Äôs a good idea
5/2/20, 11:05 AM - Ricky: Jesus
5/2/20, 11:12 AM - Parker: holy shit i just saw the day by day for each month lol
5/2/20, 11:46 AM - Jason Greenberg: <Media omitted>
5/2/20, 11:47 AM - Vaughn: r/hedidthemath
5/2/20, 11:47 AM - Parker: ^
5/2/20, 11:48 AM - Vaughn: r/hedidthemonstermath
5/2/20, 11:48 AM - Jason Greenberg: If someone wanted to take the time to do day by day I'd be impressed
5/2/20, 11:48 AM - Vaughn: 41 on 420 thats insane
5/2/20, 11:49 AM - Vaughn: Fuckin how? Thats more impressive than 1000 pushups
5/2/20, 11:49 AM - Ricky: Impressive is a funny word
5/2/20, 11:50 AM - Jason Greenberg: I wonder if this guy works
5/2/20, 11:51 AM - Vaughn: Reps of 2 every 30 minutes with a teammate repacking the bowls like a nascar pitstop
5/2/20, 11:53 AM - Jason Greenberg: It looked like 12-15 bowls/day. If you got off your job at 5pm and went to bed at 2am like he probably does, that‚Äôs 1.3-1.7 bowls/hour
5/2/20, 11:53 AM - Jason Greenberg: Not impossible
5/2/20, 12:15 PM - Parker: That‚Äôs more than doable
5/2/20, 12:15 PM - Parker: the 41 on 420 is nuts though
5/2/20, 1:00 PM - Vaughn: Whats the point at that point
5/2/20, 1:00 PM - Vaughn: Is their tolerance so high that they need that much to feel a thing?
5/2/20, 1:01 PM - Vaughn: I always thought the effects of weed plateau the more you take in a session
5/2/20, 1:01 PM - Parker: yeah i feel like your tolerance can only be so high
5/2/20, 1:01 PM - Parker: probably just to do it at that point
5/2/20, 1:01 PM - Parker: nothing better to do than to keep smoking lol
5/2/20, 1:02 PM - Parker: and if you‚Äôre a functioning stoner, there‚Äôs no reason not to if that‚Äôs what you do all the time i guess
5/2/20, 1:02 PM - Vaughn: Functioning stoners are impressive
5/2/20, 1:03 PM - Vaughn: I can understand being more creative, but my logic/reasoning would go down the drain
5/2/20, 1:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: You start to become mildly shell-y at that point
5/2/20, 1:04 PM - Jason Greenberg: Permafade vibes
5/2/20, 1:04 PM - Parker: i‚Äôm also assuming it‚Äôs easy to become a functioning stoner when you smoke that much bc you just get used to doing stuff high
5/2/20, 1:04 PM - Parker: even if it‚Äôs not at 100% mental capacity lol

6/1/20, 3:36 PM - Collin Hurst: Took not too much cause not every one was doing it , I was still able to walk around and it was so nice

6/1/20, 3:36 PM - Ricky: Woahhhh cool
6/1/20, 3:36 PM - Ricky: I bet that natural location was a nice place to do it
6/1/20, 3:36 PM - Jason Greenberg: Everything moving I would call visuals
6/1/20, 3:37 PM - Collin Hurst: I just went on a nice walk with Sasha in the wilderness, looked at bugs and shit i
6/1/20, 3:37 PM - Collin Hurst: We though we were being inconsiderate walking away for 2 hours from the group but then we came back and they said it was only 30 mins haha haha
6/1/20, 3:38 PM - Collin Hurst: I felt more in control than when I‚Äôm crossed tbh, although I didn‚Äôt take that much
6/1/20, 3:38 PM - Collin Hurst: It still lasted like 5 good hours and maybe 6.5 round trip
6/1/20, 3:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: that sounds like a good trip
6/1/20, 3:55 PM - Jason Greenberg: feel any different after?
6/1/20, 4:06 PM - Collin Hurst: Nah it was a good comedown I felt great, smoked weed later in the night and felt fine
6/1/20, 4:26 PM - Ricky: Gang gang

6/1/20, 4:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: How bout them plants tho
6/1/20, 4:50 PM - Jason Greenberg: That was the coolest part for me
6/1/20, 4:51 PM - Jason Greenberg: The ground and the trees and looking at leaves
6/1/20, 4:57 PM - Parker: i wish i had spent more time outside
6/1/20, 4:58 PM - Parker: the people i was with didn‚Äôt really want to idk why
6/1/20, 4:58 PM - Collin Hurst: Let‚Äôs do em down here in sc sometime

6/1/20, 4:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: That would be something else
6/1/20, 4:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: sad
6/1/20, 4:59 PM - Parker: !!
6/1/20, 4:59 PM - Jason Greenberg: My half-plug was in sb
6/9/20, 6:31 PM - Parker: Spontaneously decided to do shrooms earlier for my last night here

6/9/20, 7:14 PM - Ricky: Ayyyyy have fun!
6/9/20, 7:16 PM - Jason Greenberg: Send us any interesting thoughts you have!
6/10/20, 10:29 AM - Parker: Had a good trip overall. I took 2.5-3 grams so slightly less than i took my first time(3.5) so it was more lowkey of a trip but i got some decent visuals when we were watching music videos and we walked to Maartys favorite park(iykyk) and the trees and stuff were crazy to look at. I was mostly just giggly and laughed a lot but all in all a good time
6/10/20, 10:30 AM - Parker: the only thing that kinda sucked was my friend Walker who did it with us it didn‚Äôt fully hit him so he wanted to go home early so my trip was stopped short i‚Äôd say but was also on the come down when he wanted to leave
6/10/20, 10:30 AM - Parker: I also ate them directly this time which was interesting
6/10/20, 10:30 AM - Parker: not great but also not as bad as i thought they‚Äôd taste
6/10/20, 10:31 AM - Parker: https://youtu.be/tt7gP_IW-1w
6/10/20, 10:31 AM - Parker: we watched this at my peak, shit was unreal
6/10/20, 10:56 AM - Jason Greenberg: Damn glad you had a good time
6/10/20, 10:56 AM - Jason Greenberg: Sounds familiar
6/10/20, 10:56 AM - Jason Greenberg: And yeah I totally get that
6/10/20, 12:04 PM - Parker: Yeah it was a fairly mellow high but still got the effects
6/10/20, 12:04 PM - Parker: The fact that it was spontaneous made me cautious to take a full dose
6/10/20, 12:40 PM - Jason Greenberg: Makes sense
6/10/20, 12:41 PM - Jason Greenberg: Did you write anything down?
6/10/20, 3:43 PM - Parker: not as much as i meant to but i did get thisüòÇ
